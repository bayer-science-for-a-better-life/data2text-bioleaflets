NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGazyvaro 1,000 mg concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne vial of 40 mL concentrate contains 1,000 mg obinutuzumab, corresponding to a concentration \nbefore dilution of 25 mg/mL.  \n \nObinutuzumab is a Type II humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass derived \nby humanisation of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and produced in the Chinese Hamster Ovary \ncell line by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nClear, colourless to slightly brownish liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) \n \nGazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \npreviously untreated CLL and with comorbidities making them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine \nbased therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nFollicular lymphoma (FL)  \n \nGazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance therapy in patients \nachieving a response, is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced FL \n(see section 5.1) \n \nGazyvaro in combination with bendamustine followed by Gazyvaro maintenance is indicated for the \ntreatment of patients with FL who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months after \ntreatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nGazyvaro should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced physician and in an \nenvironment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available. \n \nPosology \n \nProphylaxis and premedication for tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden and/or a high circulating lymphocyte count (> 25 x 109/L) and/or \nrenal impairment (CrCl < 70 mL/min) are considered at risk of TLS and should receive prophylaxis. \nProphylaxis should consist of adequate hydration and administration of uricostatics (e.g. allopurinol), \nor suitable alternative treatment such as urate oxidase (e.g. rasburicase), starting 12-24 hours prior to \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nstart of Gazyvaro infusion as per standard practice (see section 4.4). Patients should continue to \nreceive repeated prophylaxis prior to each subsequent infusion, if deemed appropriate. \n \nProphylaxis and premedication for infusion related reactions (IRRs) \n \nPremedication to reduce the risk of IRRs is outlined in Table 1 (see also section 4.4). Corticosteroid \npremedication is recommended for patients with FL and mandatory for CLL patients in the first cycle \n(see Table 1). Premedication for subsequent infusions and other premedication should be administered \nas described below. \n \nHypotension, as a symptom of IRRs, may occur during Gazyvaro intravenous infusions. Therefore, \nwithholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout \neach Gazyvaro infusion and for the first hour after administration (see section 4.4).  \n \nTable 1 Premedication to be administered before Gazyvaro infusion to reduce the risk of \n\nIRRs in patients with CLL and FL (see section 4.4) \n \n\nDay of \ntreatment \ncycle \n\nPatients requiring \npremedication Premedication Administration \n\nCycle 1: \nDay 1 for \nCLL and \nFL \n\nAll patients \n\nIntravenous \ncorticosteroid1,4 \n\n(mandatory for CLL, \nrecommended for FL)   \n\nCompleted at least \n1 hour prior to Gazyvaro \ninfusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2  At least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion Anti-histaminic medicine3  \n\nCycle 1: \nDay 2 for \nCLL only \n\nAll patients \n\nIntravenous corticosteroid1 \n\n(mandatory)   \nCompleted at least \n1 hour prior to Gazyvaro \ninfusion  \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2  At least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion Anti-histaminic medicine3  \n\nAll \nsubsequent \ninfusions for \nCLL and \nFL \n \n \n\nPatients with no IRR \nduring the previous \ninfusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2 At least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion Patients with an IRR \n\n(Grade 1 or 2) with the \nprevious infusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2 \nAnti-histaminic medicine3  \n\nPatients with a Grade 3 \nIRR with the previous \ninfusion OR  \nPatients with \nlymphocyte counts \n>25 x 109/L prior to \nnext treatment \n\nIntravenous \ncorticosteroid1,4 \n  \n\nCompleted at least \n1 hour prior to Gazyvaro \ninfusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2 \nAnti-histaminic medicine3 \n\nAt least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion \n\n1100 mg prednisone/prednisolone or 20 mg dexamethasone or 80 mg methylprednisolone. Hydrocortisone should not be used \nas it has not been effective in reducing rates of IRR. \n2 e.g. 1,000 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol \n3 e.g. 50 mg diphenhydramine \n\n4.If a corticosteroid-containing chemotherapy regimen is administered on the same day as Gazyvaro, the corticosteroid can \nbe administered as an oral medicinal product  if given at least 60 minutes prior to Gazyvaro, in which case additional IV \ncorticosteroid as premedication is not required. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nDose \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, in combination with chlorambucil1) \n \nFor patients with CLL the recommended dose of Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is shown \nin Table 2. \n \nCycle 1 \n \nThe recommended dose of Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is 1,000 mg administered over \nDay 1 and Day 2, (or Day 1 continued), and on Day 8 and Day 15 of the first 28 day treatment cycle.  \n \nTwo infusion bags should be prepared for the infusion on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg for Day 1 and 900 mg \nfor Day 2). If the first bag is completed without modifications of the infusion rate or interruptions, the \nsecond bag may be administered on the same day (no dose delay necessary, no repetition of \npremedication), provided that appropriate time, conditions and medical supervision are available \nthroughout the infusion. If there are any modifications of the infusion rate or interruptions during the \nfirst 100 mg the second bag must be administered the following day.  \n \nCycles 2 \u2013 6 \n \nThe recommended dose of Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is 1,000 mg administered on \nDay 1 of each cycle. \n \nTable 2 Dose of Gazyvaro to be administered during 6 treatment cycles each of 28 days \n\nduration for patients with CLL \n \n\nCycle Day of treatment Dose of Gazyvaro \n\nCycle 1 \n\nDay 1 100 mg \nDay 2 \n\n(or Day 1 continued) 900 mg \n\nDay 8 1,000 mg \n\nDay 15 1,000 mg \n\nCycles 2-6 Day 1 1,000 mg \n1See section 5.1 for information on chlorambucil dose \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nSix treatment cycles, each of 28 day duration. \n \nDelayed or missed doses \n \nIf a planned dose of Gazyvaro is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible; do not wait \nuntil the next planned dose. The planned treatment interval for Gazyvaro should be maintained \nbetween doses.  \n \nFollicular lymphoma  \n \nFor patients with FL, the recommended dose of Gazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy is shown \nin Table 3. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nPatients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma  \n \nInduction (in combination with chemotherapy2) \nGazyvaro should be administered with chemotherapy as follows: \n \n\u2022 Six 28-day cycles in combination with bendamustine2 or, \n\u2022 Six 21-day cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \n\nprednisolone (CHOP), followed by 2 additional cycles of Gazyvaro alone or, \n\u2022 Eight 21-day cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and \n\nprednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone(CVP).  \n \n\nMaintenance  \n \nPatients who achieve a complete or partial response to induction treatment with Gazyvaro in \ncombination with chemotherapy (CHOP or CVP or bendamustine) should continue to receive \nGazyvaro 1,000 mg as single agent maintenance therapy once every 2 months for 2 years or until \ndisease progression (whichever occurs first). \n \nPatients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months \nafter treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen  \n \nInduction (in combination with bendamustine2) \n \nGazyvaro should be administered in six 28-day cycles in combination with bendamustine2. \n \nMaintenance  \n \nPatients who achieved a complete or partial response to induction treatment (i.e. the initial 6 treatment \ncycles) with Gazyvaro in combination with bendamustine or have stable disease should continue to \nreceive Gazyvaro 1,000 mg as single agent maintenance therapy once every 2 months for 2 years or \nuntil disease progression (whichever occurs first). \n \nTable 3 Follicular lymphoma: Dose of Gazyvaro to be administered during induction \n\ntreatment, followed by maintenance treatment  \n \n\nCycle Day of treatment Dose of Gazyvaro \n\nCycle 1 \n \n\nDay 1 1,000 mg \n\nDay 8 1,000 mg \n\nDay 15 1,000 mg \n\nCycles 2\u20136 \nor 2\u20138 Day 1 1,000 mg \n\nMaintenance  \nEvery 2 months for 2 years \nor until disease progression \n\n(whichever occurs first) \n1,000 mg \n\n2See section 5.1 for information on bendamustine dose \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nDuration of treatment \n \nInduction treatment of approximately six months (six treatment cycles of Gazyvaro, each of 28 day \nduration when combined with bendamustine, or eight treatment cycles of Gazyvaro, each of 21 day \nduration when combined with CHOP or CVP) followed by maintenance once every 2 months for 2 \nyears or until disease progression (whichever occurs first). \n \nDelayed or missed doses  \nIf a planned dose of Gazyvaro is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible; do not omit it \nor wait until the next planned dose.  \nIf toxicity occurs before Cycle 1 Day 8 or Cycle 1 Day 15, requiring delay of treatment, these doses \nshould be given after resolution of toxicity. In such instances, all subsequent visits and the start of \nCycle 2 will be shifted to accommodate for the delay in Cycle 1.  \n \nDuring maintenance, maintain the original dosing schedule for subsequent doses. \n \nDose modifications during treatment (all indications) \n \nNo dose reductions of Gazyvaro are recommended.  \n \nFor management of symptomatic adverse events (including IRRs), see paragraph below (Management \nof IRRs or section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance [CrCl] 30-89 mL/min) (see section 5.2). The safety and efficacy of Gazyvaro has not been \nestablished in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n  \nThe safety and efficacy of Gazyvaro in patients with impaired hepatic function has not been \nestablished. No specific dose recommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Gazyvaro in children and adolescents aged below 18 years has not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGazyvaro is for intravenous use. It should be given as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line \nafter dilution (see section 6.6). Gazyvaro infusions should not be administered as an intravenous push \nor bolus.  \n \nFor instructions on dilution of Gazyvaro before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nInstructions on the rate of infusion are shown in Tables 4-5. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nTable 4 Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: Standard infusion rate in the absence of \nIRRs/hypersensitivity and recommendations in case an IRR occurred with previous \ninfusion  \n\n \n\nCycle Day of \ntreatment \n\nRate of infusion  \nThe infusion rate may be escalated provided \nthat the patient can tolerate it. For \nmanagement of IRRs that occur during the \ninfusion, refer to \u201cManagement of IRRs\u201d. \n\nCycle 1 \n\nDay 1  \n(100 mg) \n\nAdminister at 25 mg/hr over 4 hours. Do not \nincrease the infusion rate. \n\nDay 2  \n(or Day 1 \ncontinued)  \n(900 mg) \n\nIf no IRR occurred during the previous \ninfusion, administer at 50 mg/hr.  \nThe rate of the infusion can be escalated in \nincrements of 50 mg/hr every 30 minutes to \na maximum rate of 400 mg/hr. \n \nIf the patient experienced an IRR during the \nprevious infusion, start with administration \nat 25 mg/hr. The rate of infusion can be \nescalated in increments up to 50 mg/hr every \n30 minutes to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hr.  \n\nDay 8 \n(1,000 mg) If no IRR occurred during the previous infusion, \n\nwhen the final infusion rate was 100 mg/hr or \nfaster, infusions can be started at a rate of \n100 mg/hr and increased by 100 mg/hr \nincrements every 30 minutes to a maximum of \n400 mg/hr. \n\nIf the patient experienced an IRR during the \nprevious infusion administer at 50 mg/hr. The \nrate of the infusion can be escalated in \nincrements of 50 mg/hr every 30 minutes to a \nmaximum rate of 400 mg/hr. \n \n\nDay 15 \n(1,000 mg) \n\nCycles 2-6 Day 1 \n(1,000 mg) \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nTable 5 Follicular lymphoma: Standard infusion rate in the absence of IRRs /hypersensitivity \nand recommendations in case an IRR occurred with previous infusion \n\n \n\nCycle Day of treatment Rate of infusion  \nThe infusion rate may be escalated provided \nthat the patient can tolerate it. For \nmanagement of IRRs that occur during the \ninfusion, refer to \u201cManagement of IRRs\u201d.  \n\nCycle 1 \n \n\nDay 1 \n(1,000 mg) \n\nAdminister at 50 mg/hr. The rate of infusion \ncan be escalated in 50 mg/hr increments every \n30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. \n\nDay 8 \n(1,000 mg) \n\nIf no IRR or if an IRR Grade 1 occurred \nduring the previous infusion when the final \ninfusion rate was 100 mg/hr or faster, \ninfusions can be started at a rate of 100 mg/hr \nand increased by 100 mg/hr increments every \n30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. \n \n\nIf the patient experienced an IRR of Grade 2 \nor higher during the previous infusion \nadminister at 50 mg/hr. The rate of infusion \ncan be escalated in 50 mg/hr increments every \n30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. \n \n\nDay 15 \n(1,000 mg) \n\nCycles 2\u20136 or \n2\u20138 \n\nDay 1 \n(1,000 mg) \n\nMaintenance \nEvery 2 months for 2 years or \n\nuntil disease progression \n(whichever occurs first)  \n\n \nManagement of IRRs (all indications) \n \nManagement of IRRs may require temporary interruption, reduction in the rate of infusion, or \ntreatment discontinuations of Gazyvaro as outlined below (see also section 4.4). \n \n\u2022 Grade 4 (life threatening): Infusion must be stopped and therapy must be permanently \n\ndiscontinued. \n\u2022 Grade 3 (severe): Infusion must be temporarily stopped and symptoms treated. Upon resolution \n\nof symptoms, the infusion can be restarted at no more than half the previous rate (the rate being \nused at the time that the IRR occurred) and, if the patient does not experience any IRR \nsymptoms, the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate \nfor the treatment dose (see Tables 4 and 5). For CLL patients receiving the Day 1 (Cycle 1) dose \nsplit over two days, the Day 1 infusion rate may be increased back up to 25 mg/hr after 1 hour, \nbut not increased further.  \nThe infusion must be stopped and therapy permanently discontinued if the patient experiences a \nsecond occurrence of a Grade 3 IRR. \n\n\u2022 Grade 1-2 (mild to moderate): The infusion rate must be reduced and symptoms treated. \nInfusion can be continued upon resolution of symptoms and, if the patient does not experience \nany IRR symptoms, the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as \nappropriate for the treatment dose (see Tables 4 and 5). For CLL patients receiving the Day 1 \n(Cycle 1) dose split over the two days, the Day 1 infusion rate may be increased back up to \n25 mg/hr after 1 hour, but not increased further. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file.  \n \nBased on a subgroup analysis in previously untreated follicular lymphoma, the efficacy in FLIPI low \nrisk (0-1) patients is currently inconclusive (see section 5.1). A therapy choice for these patients \nshould carefully consider the overall safety profile of Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy and the  \npatient-specific situation. \n \nInfusion related reactions  \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving Gazyvaro were \nIRRs, which occurred predominantly during infusion of the first 1,000 mg. IRRs may be related to \ncytokine release syndrome which has also been reported in Gazyvaro treated patients. In CLL patients \nwho received the combined measures for prevention of IRRs (adequate corticosteroid, oral \nanalgesic/anti-histamine, omission of antihypertensive medicine in the morning of the first infusion, \nand the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose administered over 2 days) as described in section 4.2, a decreased \nincidence of IRRs of all Grades was observed. The rates of Grade 3-4 IRRs (which were based on a \nrelatively small number of patients) were similar before and after mitigation measures were \nimplemented. Mitigation measures to reduce IRRs should be followed (see section 4.2). The incidence \nand severity of infusion related symptoms decreased substantially after the first 1,000 mg was infused, \nwith most patients having no IRRs during subsequent administrations of Gazyvaro (see section 4.8). \n \nIn the majority of patients, irrespective of indication, IRRs were mild to moderate and could be \nmanaged by the slowing or temporary halting of the first infusion, but severe and life-threatening IRRs \nrequiring symptomatic treatment have also been reported. IRRs may be clinically indistinguishable \nfrom immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis). Patients with a high \ntumour burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte count in CLL [> 25 x 109/L] may be at increased \nrisk of severe IRRs. Patients with renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) and patients with both \nCumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) > 6 and CrCl < 70 mL/min are more at risk of IRRs, including \nsevere IRRs (see section 4.8). For management of IRRs see section 4.2 Posology and method of \nadministration. \n \nPatients must not receive further Gazyvaro infusions if they experience:  \n\u2022 acute life-threatening respiratory symptoms,  \n\u2022 a Grade 4 (i.e. life threatening) IRR or,  \n\u2022 a second occurrence of a Grade 3 (prolonged/recurrent) IRR (after resuming the first infusion or \n\nduring a subsequent infusion). \n \nPatients who have pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions should be monitored carefully \nthroughout the infusion and the post-infusion period. Hypotension may occur during Gazyvaro \nintravenous infusions. Therefore, withholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for \n12 hours prior to and throughout each Gazyvaro infusion and for the first hour after administration. \nPatients at acute risk of hypertensive crisis should be evaluated for the benefits and risks of \nwithholding their anti-hypertensive medicine. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions  \n \nHypersensitivity reactions with immediate (e.g.  anaphylaxis) and delayed onset (e.g. serum sickness) \nhave been reported in patients treated with Gazyvaro. Hypersensitivity may be difficult to clinically \ndistinguish from IRRs. Hypersensitivity symptoms can occur after previous exposure and very rarely \nwith the first infusion. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during or after an infusion, the \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\ninfusion must be stopped and treatment permanently discontinued. Patients with known \nhypersensitivity to obinutuzumab must not be treated (see section 4.3). \n \nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n \nTLS has been reported with Gazyvaro. Patients who are considered to be at risk of TLS (e.g. patients \nwith a high tumour burden and/or a high circulating lymphocyte count [> 25 x 109/L] and/or renal \nimpairment [CrCl < 70 mL/min]) should receive prophylaxis. Prophylaxis should consist of adequate \nhydration and administration of uricostatics (e.g. allopurinol), or a suitable alternative such as a urate \noxidate (e.g. rasburicase) starting 12-24 hours prior to the infusion of Gazyvaro as per standard \npractice (see section 4.2). All patients considered at risk should be carefully monitored during the \ninitial days of treatment with a special focus on renal function, potassium, and uric acid values. Any \nadditional guidelines according to standard practice should be followed. For treatment of TLS, correct \nelectrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, \nincluding dialysis as indicated. \n \nNeutropenia  \n \nSevere and life-threatening neutropenia including febrile neutropenia has been reported during \ntreatment with Gazyvaro. Patients who experience neutropenia should be closely monitored with \nregular laboratory tests until resolution. If treatment is necessary it should be administered in \naccordance with local guidelines and the administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors  \n(G-CSF) should be considered. Any signs of concomitant infection should be treated as appropriate. \nDose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening neutropenia. It is strongly \nrecommended that patients with severe neutropenia lasting more than 1 week receive antimicrobial \nprophylaxis throughout the treatment period until resolution to Grade 1 or 2. Antiviral and antifungal \nprophylaxis should also be considered (see section 4.2). Late onset neutropenia (occurring >28 days \nafter the end of treatment) or prolonged neutropenia (lasting more than 28 days after treatment has \nbeen completed/stopped) may occur. Patients with renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) are more at \nrisk of neutropenia (see section 4.8).  \n \nThrombocytopenia \n \nSevere and life-threatening thrombocytopenia including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within \n24 hours after the infusion) has been observed during treatment with Gazyvaro. Patients with renal \nimpairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min) are more at risk of thrombocytopenia (see section 4.8). Fatal \nhaemorrhagic events have also been reported in Cycle 1 in patients treated with Gazyvaro. A clear \nrelationship between thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events has not been established.  \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle; regular \nlaboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in \ncase of severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Transfusion of blood products (i.e. platelet \ntransfusion) according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician. Use of any \nconcomitant therapies which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events, such as platelet \ninhibitors and anticoagulants, should also be taken into consideration, especially during the first cycle. \n \nWorsening of pre-existing cardiac conditions \n \nIn patients with underlying cardiac disease, arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation and \ntachyarrhythmia), angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction and heart failure \nhave occurred when treated with Gazyvaro (see section 4.8). These events may occur as part of an IRR \nand can be fatal. Therefore patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely. In \naddition these patients should be hydrated with caution in order to prevent a potential fluid overload. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nInfections \n \nGazyvaro should not be administered in the presence of an active infection and caution should be \nexercised when considering the use of Gazyvaro in patients with a history of recurring or chronic \ninfections.  Serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and \nfollowing the completion of Gazyvaro therapy. Fatal infections have been reported.  \n \nPatients (CLL) with both CIRS > 6 and CrCl < 70 mL/min are more at risk of infections, including \nsevere infections (see section 4.8). In the follicular lymphoma studies, a high incidence of infections \nwas observed in all phases of the studies, including follow-up, with the highest incidence seen in the \nmaintenance phase. During the follow-up phase, Grade 3-5 infections are observed more in patients \nwho received Gazyvaro plus bendamustine in the induction phase. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation  \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure \nand death, can occur in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies including Gazyvaro (see section \n4.8). HBVscreening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with Gazyvaro. \nAt a minimum this should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status and hepatitis B core \nantibody (HBcAb) status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local \nguidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not be treated with Gazyvaro. Patients with \npositive hepatitis B serology should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should \nbe monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis reactivation.  \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients treated with \nGazyvaro (see section 4.8). The diagnosis of PML should be considered in any patient presenting with \nnew-onset or changes to pre-existing neurologic manifestations. The symptoms of PML are \nnonspecific and can vary depending on the affected region of the brain. Motor symptoms with \ncorticospinal tract findings (e.g. muscular weakness, paralysis and sensory disturbances), sensory \nabnormalities, cerebellar symptoms, and visual field defects are common. Some signs/symptoms \nregarded as \u201ccortical\u201d (e.g. aphasia or visual-spatial disorientation) may occur. Evaluation of PML \nincludes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI), and lumbar puncture (cerebrospinal fluid testing for John Cunningham viral DNA). Therapy \nwith Gazyvaro should be withheld during the investigation of potential PML and permanently \ndiscontinued in case of confirmed PML. Discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant \nchemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be considered. The patient should be \nreferred to a neurologist for the evaluation and treatment of PML. \n \nImmunisation \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live or attenuated viral vaccines following Gazyvaro therapy has not \nbeen studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until \nB-cell recovery.  \n \nExposure in utero to obinutuzumab and vaccination of infants with live virus vaccines \n \nDue to the potential depletion of B-cells in infants of mothers who have been exposed to Gazyvaro \nduring pregnancy, infants should be monitored for B-cell depletion and vaccinations with live virus \nvaccines should be postponed until the infant\u2019s B-cell count has recovered.  The safety and timing of \nvaccination should be discussed with the infant\u2019s physician (see section 4.6). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed, although limited drug-drug interaction \nsub-studies have been undertaken for Gazyvaro with bendamustine, CHOP, fludarabine and \ncyclophosphamide (FC), and chlorambucil.  \n \nA risk for interactions with other concomitantly used medicinal products cannot be excluded. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nObinutuzumab is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450), uridine \ndiphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and transporters such as P-glycoprotein. Therefore, \nno pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products known to be metabolised by these \nenzyme systems. \n \nCo-administration with Gazyvaro had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine, FC, \nchlorambucil or the individual components of CHOP. In addition, there were no apparent effects of \nbendamustine, FC, chlorambucil or CHOP on the pharmacokinetics of Gazyvaro. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nVaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell recovery \nbecause of the immunosuppressive effect of obinutuzumab (see section 4.4). \n \nThe combination of obinutuzumab with chlorambucil, bendamustine, CHOP or CVP may increase the \nrisk of neutropenia (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and for 18 months after \ntreatment with Gazyvaro. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA reproduction study in cynomolgus monkeys showed no evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \nteratogenic effects but resulted in a complete depletion of B-lymphocytes in offspring. B-cell counts \nreturned to normal levels in the offspring, and immunologic function was restored within 6 months of \nbirth. Serum concentrations of obinutuzumab in offspring were similar to those in the mothers on \nday 28 post-partum, whereas concentrations in milk on the same day were very low, suggesting that \nobinutuzumab crosses the placenta (see section 5.3). There are no data from the use of obinutuzumab \nin pregnant women. Gazyvaro should not be administered to pregnant women unless the possible \nbenefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nIn case of exposure during pregnancy, depletion of B-cells may be expected in infants due to the \npharmacological properties of the product. Postponing vaccination with live vaccines should be \nconsidered for infants born to mothers who have been exposed to Gazyvaro during pregnancy until the \ninfant\u2019s B-cell levels are within normal ranges (see section 4.4). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAnimal studies have shown secretion of obinutuzumab in breast milk (see section 5.3). \n \nSince human immunoglobulin G (IgG) is secreted in human milk and the potential for absorption and \nharm to the infant is unknown, women should be advised to discontinue breast-feeding during \nGazyvaro therapy and for 18 months after the last dose of Gazyvaro. \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of obinutuzumab on fertility. \nNo adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in repeat-dose toxicity \nstudies in cynomolgus monkeys (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGazyvaro has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. IRRs are very \ncommon during the first infusion of Gazyvaro, and patients experiencing infusion related symptoms \nshould be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) described in this section were identified during induction, \nmaintenance and follow up for indolent Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) including FL; treatment and \nfollow up for CLL in the three pivotal clinical studies: \n\u2022 BO21004/CLL11 (N=781): Patients with previously untreated CLL \n\u2022 BO21223/GALLIUM (N=1390): Patients with previously untreated iNHL (86% of the patients \n\nhad FL) \n\u2022 GAO4753g/GADOLIN (N=409): Patients with iNHL (81% of the patients had FL) who had no \n\nresponse to or who progressed during or up to 6 months after treatment with rituximab or a \nrituximab-containing regimen.  \n\n \nThese trials investigated Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil for CLL and with bendamustine, \nCHOP or CVP followed by Gazyvaro maintenance therapy for iNHL. The studies \nBO21223/GALLIUM and GAO4753g/GADOLIN enrolled patients with iNHL including FL. \nTherefore, in order to provide the most comprehensive safety information, the analysis of ADRs \npresented in the following has been performed on the entire study population (i.e. iNHL). \n \nTable 6 summarises the ADRs of the pivotal studies (BO21004/CLL11, BO21223/GALLIUM \nGAO4753g/GADOLIN) that occurred at a higher incidence (difference of \u2265 2%) compared to the \nrelevant comparator arm in at least one pivotal study in: \n\u2022 Patients with CLL receiving Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil alone or \n\nrituximab plus chlorambucil (study BO21004/CLL11)  \n\u2022 Patients with previously untreated iNHL receiving Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy (bendamustine, \n\nCHOP, CVP) followed by Gazyvaro maintenance in patients achieving a response, compared to \nrituximab plus chemotherapy followed by rituximab maintenance in patients achieving a \nresponse (study BO21223/GALLIUM) \n\n\u2022 Patients with iNHL who had no response to or who progressed during or up to 6 months after \ntreatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen receiving Gazyvaro plus \nbendamustine, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance in some patients, compared to bendamustine \nalone (study GAO4753g/GADOLIN)  \n\nThe incidences presented in Table 6 (all grades and Grades 3-5) are the highest incidence of that ADR \nreported from any of the three studies.  \n \nFrequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 6 Summary of ADRs reported with a higher incidence (difference of \u22652% versus the \n\ncomparator arm) in patients# receiving Gazyvaro + chemotherapy*  \n \n\nSystem organ class \nFrequency \n\nAll Grades  \nGazyvaro + chemotherapy* \n(CLL, iNHL) followed by \n\nGazyvaro maintenance (iNHL) \n\nGrades 3-5\u2020  \nGazyvaro + chemotherapy* \n\n(CLL, iNHL) followed by \nGazyvaro maintenance (iNHL) \n\nInfections and infestations \nVery common Upper respiratory tract infection, \n\nsinusitis\u00a7,urinary tract infection, \npneumonia\u00a7 ,herpes zoster\u00a7, \nnasopharyngitis \n\n \n\nCommon Oral herpes, rhinitis, pharyngitis, \nlung infection, influenza  \n\nUrinary tract infection, \npneumonia, lung infection, upper \nrespiratory tract infection, \nsinusitis, herpes zoster \n\nUncommon  Nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, \ninfluenza, oral herpes \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \nCommon Squamous cell carcinoma of skin, \n\nBasal cell carcinoma \nSquamous cell carcinoma of skin, \nBasal cell carcinoma \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery common Neutropenia\u00a7, thrombocytopenia, \n\nanaemia, leukopenia \nNeutropenia, thrombocytopenia  \n\nCommon  Febrile neutropenia Anaemia, leukopenia, febrile \nneutropenia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon Tumour lysis syndrome, \n\nhyperuricaemia, hypokalaemia \nTumour lysis syndrome, \nhypokalaemia \n\nUncommon  Hyperuricaemia \nPsychiatric disorders \nVery common Insomnia  \nCommon Depression, anxiety  \nUncommon  Insomnia, depression, anxiety \nNervous system disorders \nVery common Headache  \nUncommon  Headache \nCardiac disorders \nCommon Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation \nVascular disorders \nCommon Hypertension Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nVery common Cough\u00a7  \nCommon Nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, \n\noropharyngeal pain \n \n\nUncommon  Cough, oropharyngeal pain \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Diarrhoea, constipation\u00a7  \nCommon Dyspepsia, haemorrhoids Diarrhoea \nUncommon  Constipation, haemorrhoids \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery common Alopecia, pruritus  \nCommon Eczema  \nUncommon  Pruritus \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nSystem organ class \nFrequency \n\nAll Grades  \nGazyvaro + chemotherapy* \n(CLL, iNHL) followed by \n\nGazyvaro maintenance (iNHL) \n\nGrades 3-5\u2020  \nGazyvaro + chemotherapy* \n\n(CLL, iNHL) followed by \nGazyvaro maintenance (iNHL) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common Arthralgia\u00a7, back pain, pain in \n\nextremity \n \n\nCommon Musculoskeletal chest pain, bone \npain \n\nPain in extremity \n\nUncommon  Arthralgia, back pain, \nmusculoskeletal chest pain, bone \npain \n\nRenal and Urinary Disorders \nCommon  Dysuria, urinary incontinence  \nUncommon  Dysuria, urinary incontinence \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common Pyrexia, Asthenia, fatigue  \nCommon Chest pain Pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue \nUncommon  Chest pain \nInvestigations \nCommon White blood cell count decreased, \n\nneutrophil count decreased, \nweight increased \n\nWhite blood cell count decreased, \nneutrophil count decreased \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nVery common IRRs  IRRs  \n#with a higher incidence (difference of \u2265 2% between the treatment arms).

The most common Grade 3-5 adverse reactions were \nneutropenia (10%), febrile neutropenia (2%) and anaemia,  thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, sepsis, \nupper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (all at 1%).  \n \nThe profile of adverse reactions in patients with FL was consistent with the overall iNHL population \nin both studies. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThe incidences presented in the following sections if referring to iNHL are the highest incidence of \nthat ADR reported from either pivotal study (BO21223/GALLIUM, GAO4753g/GADOLIN). \n \nInfusion related reactions  \n \nMost frequently reported (\u2265 5%) symptoms associated with an IRR were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \nheadache, dizziness, fatigue, chills, pyrexia, hypotension, flushing, hypertension, tachycardia, \ndyspnoea, and chest discomfort. Respiratory symptoms such as bronchospasm, larynx and throat \nirritation, wheezing, laryngeal oedema and cardiac symptoms such as atrial fibrillation have also been \nreported (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia  \n \nThe incidence of IRRs was higher in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm compared to the rituximab \nplus chlorambucil arm. The incidence of IRRs was 66% with the infusion of the first 1,000 mg of \nGazyvaro (20% of patients experiencing a Grade 3-4 IRR). Overall, 7% of patients experienced an \nIRR leading to discontinuation of Gazyvaro. The incidence of IRRs with subsequent infusions was 3% \nwith the second 1,000 mg dose and 1% thereafter. No Grade 3-5 IRRs were reported beyond the first \n1,000 mg infusions of Cycle 1.  \n \nIn patients who received the recommended measures for prevention of IRRs as described in section \n4.2, a decreased incidence of IRRs of all Grades was observed. The rates of Grade 3-4 IRRs (which \noccurred in relatively few patients) were similar before and after mitigation measures were \nimplemented. \n \nIndolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma including Follicular Lymphoma  \n \nGrade 3-4 IRRs occurred in 12% of patients. In Cycle 1, the overall incidence of IRRs was higher in \npatients receiving Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy compared to patients in the comparator arm. In \npatients receiving Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy, the incidence of IRRs was highest on Day 1 and \ngradually decreased with subsequent infusions. This decreasing trend continued during maintenance \ntherapy with Gazyvaro alone. Beyond Cycle 1 the incidence of IRRs in subsequent infusions was \ncomparable between the Gazyvaro and the relevant comparator arms. Overall, 4% of patients \nexperienced an infusion related reaction leading to discontinuation of Gazyvaro. \n \nNeutropenia and infections \n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia \n \nThe incidence of neutropenia was higher in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm (41%) compared to \nthe rituximab plus chlorambucil arm with the neutropenia resolving spontaneously or with use of \ngranulocyte-colony stimulating factors. The incidence of infection was 38% in the Gazyvaro plus \nchlorambucil arm and 37% in the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm (with Grade 3-5 events reported in \n12% and 14%, respectively and fatal events reported in < 1% in both treatment arms). Cases of \nprolonged neutropenia (2% in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm and 4% in the rituximab plus \nchlorambucil arm) and late onset neutropenia (16% in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm and 12% \nin the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm) were also reported (see section 4.4). \n \nIndolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma including Follicular Lymphoma  \n \nIn the Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy arm, the incidence of Grade 1-4 neutropenia (50%) was higher \nrelative to the comparator arm with an increased risk during the induction period. The incidence of \nprolonged neutropenia and late onset neutropenia was 3% and 8%, respectively. The incidence of \ninfection was 81% in the Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy arm (with Grade 3-5 events reported in 22% of \npatients and fatal events reported in 3% of patients). Patients who received G-CSF prophylaxis had a \nlower rate of Grade 3-5 infections (see section 4.4). \n \nThrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events \n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia \n \nThe incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm compared to \nthe rituximab plus chlorambucil arm (16% vs. 7%) especially during the first cycle. Four percent of \npatients treated with Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil experienced acute thrombocytopenia (occurring \nwithin 24 hours after the Gazyvaro infusion) (see section 4.4). The overall incidence of haemorrhagic \nevents was similar in the Gazyvaro treated arm and in the rituximab treated arm. The number of fatal \nhaemorrhagic events was balanced between the treatment arms; however, all of the events in patients \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\ntreated with Gazyvaro were reported in Cycle 1. No Grade 5 events of thrombocytopenia were \nreported. A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events has not been \nestablished. \n \nIndolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma including Follicular Lymphoma  \n \nThe incidence of thrombocytopenia was 15%. Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in Cycle 1 \nin the Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy arm. Thrombocytopenia occurring during or 24 hours from end of \ninfusion (acute thrombocytopenia) was more frequently observed in patients in the Gazyvaro plus \nchemotherapy arm than in the comparator arm. The incidence of haemorrhagic events was similar \nacross all treatment arms. Haemorrhagic events and Grade 3-5 haemorrhagic events occurred in 12% \nand 4% of patients, respectively. While fatal haemorrhagic events occurred in less than 1% of patients; \nnone of the fatal adverse events occurred in Cycle 1. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia \n \nIn the pivotal BO21004/CLL11 study, 46% (156 out of 336) of patients with CLL treated with \nGazyvaro plus chlorambucil were 75 years or older (median age was 74 years). These patients \nexperienced more serious adverse events and adverse events leading to death than those patients \n< 75 years of age. \n \nIndolent Non Hodgkin Lymphoma including Follicular Lymphoma \n \nIn the pivotal studies (BO21223/GALLIUM, GAO4753g/GADOLIN) in iNHL, patients 65 years or \nolder experienced more serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal or death than \npatients < 65 years of age. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia \n \nIn the pivotal BO21004/CLL11 study, 27% (90 out of 336) of patients treated with Gazyvaro plus \nchlorambucil had moderate renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min). These patients experienced more \nserious adverse events and adverse events leading to death than patients with a CrCl \u2265 50 mL/min \n(see section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). Patients with a CrCl < 30 mL/min were excluded from the study \n(see section 5.1). \n \nIndolent Non Hodgkin Lymphoma including Follicular Lymphoma \n \nIn the pivotal studies (BO21223/GALLIUM, GAO4753g/GADOLIN) in iNHL, 5% (35 out of 698) \nand 7% (14 out of 204) of patients treated with Gazyvaro, respectively, had moderate renal \nimpairment (CrCL < 50 mL/min). These patients experienced more serious adverse events, G rade 3 to \n5 adverse events  and adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal (patients in BO21223 only) than \npatients with a CrCl \u2265 50 mL/min (see section 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with a CrCl < 40 mL/min were \nexcluded from the studies (see section 5.1). \n \nAdditional safety information from clinical studies experience \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  \nPML has been reported in patients treated with Gazyvaro (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation  \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients treated with Gazyvaro \n(see section 4.4). \n \nGastro-Intestinal Perforation  \n \nCases of gastro-intestinal perforation have been reported in patients receiving Gazyvaro, mainly in \niNHL. In the pivotal studies in iNHL up to 1% of patients experienced gastrointestinal perforation. \n \nWorsening of pre-existing cardiac conditions \n \nCases of arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia), angina pectoris, acute coronary \nsyndrome, myocardial infarction and heart failure have occurred when treated with Gazyvaro (see \nsection 4.4). These events may occur as part of an IRR and can be fatal. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nTransient elevation in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase \n[ALT], alkaline phosphatase) has been observed shortly after the first infusion of Gazyvaro.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo experience with overdose is available from human clinical studies. In clinical studies with \nGazyvaro, doses ranging from 50 mg up to and including 2,000 mg per infusion have been \nadministered. The incidence and intensity of adverse reactions reported in these studies did not appear \nto be dose dependent. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption or reduction of their infusion \nand be closely supervised. Consideration should be given to the need for regular monitoring of blood \ncell count and for increased risk of infections while patients are B-cell depleted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC15 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nObinutuzumab is a recombinant monoclonal humanised and glycoengineered Type II anti-CD20 \nantibody of the IgG1 isotype. It specifically targets the extracellular loop of the CD20 transmembrane \nantigen on the surface of non-malignant and malignant pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes, but not on \nhaematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. Glycoengineering \nof the Fc part of obinutuzumab results in higher affinity for Fc\u0263RIII receptors on immune effector \ncells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and monocytes as compared to  \nnon-glycoengineered antibodies. \n \n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/template-form/appendix-v-adverse-drug-reaction-reporting-details_en.doc\n\n\n19 \n \n\nIn nonclinical studies, obinutuzumab induces direct cell death and mediates antibody dependent \ncellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) through \nrecruitment of Fc\u0263RIII positive immune effector cells. In addition, in vivo, obinutuzumab mediates a \nlow degree of complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Compared to Type I antibodies, \nobinutuzumab, a Type II antibody, is characterised by an enhanced direct cell death induction with a \nconcomitant reduction in CDC at an equivalent dose. Obinutuzumab, as a glycoengineered antibody, is \ncharacterised by enhanced ADCC and ADCP compared to non-glycoengineered antibodies at an \nequivalent dose. In animal models obinutuzumab mediates potent B-cell depletion and antitumour \nefficacy.  \n \nIn the pivotal clinical study in patients with CLL (BO21004/CLL11), 91% (40 out of 44) of evaluable \npatients treated with Gazyvaro were B-cell depleted (defined as CD19+ B-cell counts < 0.07 x 109/L) \nat the end of treatment period and remained depleted during the first 6 months of follow up. Recovery \nof B-cells was observed within 12-18 months of follow up in 35% (14 out of 40) of patients without \nprogressive disease and 13% (5 out of 40) with progressive disease.  \n \nIn the pivotal clinical study in patients with iNHL (GAO4753/GADOLIN), 97% (171 out of 176) of \nevaluable patients treated with Gazyvaro were B-cell depleted at the end of the treatment period, and \n97% (61 out of 63) remained depleted for more than 6 months from the last dose. Recovery of B-cells \nwas observed within 12-18 months of follow-up in 11% (5 out of 46) of evaluable patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia \n \nA Phase III international, multicentre, open label, randomised, two-stage, three-arm clinical study \n(BO21004/CLL11) investigating the efficacy and safety of Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil (GClb) \ncompared to rituximab plus chlorambucil (RClb) or chlorambucil (Clb) alone was conducted in \npatients with previously untreated CLL with comorbidities.  \n \nPrior to enrolment, patients had to have documented CD20+ CLL, and one or both of the following \nmeasures of coexisting medical conditions: comorbidity score (CIRS) of greater than 6 or reduced \nrenal function as measured by CrCl < 70 mL/min. Patients with inadequate liver function (National \nCancer Institute \u2013 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 liver function tests \n(AST, ALT > 5 x ULN for > 2 weeks; bilirubin > 3 x ULN) and renal function (CrCl < 30 mL/min) \nwere excluded. Patients with one or more individual organ/system impairment score of 4 as assessed \nby the CIRS definition, excluding eyes, ears, nose, throat and larynx organ system, were excluded. \n \nA total of 781 patients were randomised 2:2:1 to receive Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil, rituximab plus \nchlorambucil or chlorambucil alone. Stage 1a compared Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil to chlorambucil \nalone in 356 patients and Stage 2 compared Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil to rituximab plus \nchlorambucil in 663 patients.  \n \nIn the majority of patients, Gazyvaro was given intravenously as a 1,000 mg initial dose administered \non Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of the first treatment cycle. In order to reduce the rate of infusion related \nreactions in patients, an amendment was implemented and 140 patients received the first Gazyvaro \ndose administered over 2 days (Day 1 [100 mg] and Day 2 [900 mg]) (see section 4.2 and 4.4). For \neach subsequent treatment cycle (Cycles 2 to 6), patients received Gazyvaro 1,000 mg on Day 1 only. \nChlorambucil was given orally at 0.5 mg/kg body weight on Day 1 and Day 15 of all treatment cycles \n(1 to 6). \n \nThe demographics data and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms. \nThe majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and male (61%). The median age was 73 years, with \n44% being 75 years or older.

Patients with FL Grade 3b were excluded from the study. Patients were randomised to \n1:1 to receive either Gazyvaro (n=601 patients) or rituximab (n=601 patients) in combination with \nchemotherapy (bendamustine, CHOP or CVP), followed by Gazyvaro or rituximab maintenance in \npatients achieving a complete or partial response.  \n \nGazyvaro was given by intravenous infusion as a dose of 1,000 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, on \nDay 1 of subsequent cycles. In total, six cycles of Gazyvaro (every 28 days) were given in \ncombination with six cycles of bendamustine, and a total of eight cycles of Gazyvaro (every 21 days) \nwere given in combination with six cycles of CHOP or eight cycles of CVP. Gazyvaro was \nadministered prior to chemotherapy. Bendamustine was given intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for all \ntreatment cycles (Cycles 1-6) at 90 mg/m2/day when given in combination with Gazyvaro. Standard \ndosing of CHOP and CVP was given. Following Cycles 6-8, in combination with chemotherapy, \nresponding patients received Gazyvaro maintenance therapy every 2 months until disease progression \nor for up to 2 years.  \n \nThe demographic data and baseline characteristics of the patient population were well balanced \nbetween the treatment arms; median age was 59 years, 81% were Caucasian, 53% were female, 79% \nhad a FLIPI score of \u2265 2 and 7% had Stage II (bulky), 35% had Stage III and 57% had Stage IV \ndisease, 44% had bulky disease (> 7 cm), 34% had at least one B-symptom at baseline and 97% had an \nECOG performance status of 0-1 at baseline.

In patients with FLIPI score 0-1 (low risk), no difference between Gazyvaro plus \nchemotherapy and rituximab plus chemotherapy was observed (INV-assessed PFS HR 1.17 (95%CI \n0.63;2.19, 40 PFS events).  This subgroup  comprised 21% (253/1202) of the FL ITT  population and  \nexperienced 16.3% (40/245) of the PFS events. In addition, exploratory subgroup analyses of PFS \nacross chemotherapy regimens (bendamustine, CHOP and CVP) were consistent with the results seen \nin the Gazyvaro plus chemotherapy population. The observed HRs by chemotherapy subgroup were as \nfollows; CHOP (n = 398): HR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.20), CVP (n = 118): HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.21), \nand bendamustine (n = 686): HR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.86).  \n \nPatient Reported Outcomes  \n \nBased on the FACT-Lym questionnaire collected during treatment and follow-up phases, patients in \nboth treatment arms experienced clinically meaningful improvements in lymphoma-related symptoms \nas defined by a \u2265 3 point increase from baseline in the Lymphoma subscale, a \u2265 6 point increase from \nbaseline in the FACT Lym TOI and a \u2265 7 point increase from baseline in the FACT Lym Total score. \nEQ-5D utility scores were similar at baseline, during treatment and follow-up. No meaningful \ndifferences were seen between the arms in HRQOL or health status measures. \n \nDue to the open label design the patient reported outcomes should be interpreted with caution. \n \nPatients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months \nafter treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (study GAO4753g/GADOLIN). \n \nIn a phase III, open label, multicentre, randomised clinical study (GAO4753g/GADOLIN), \n396 patients with iNHL who had no response during treatment or who progressed within 6 months \nfollowing the last dose of rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (including rituximab \nmonotherapy as part of induction or maintenance treatment) were evaluated. Patients were randomised \n1:1 to receive either bendamustine (B) alone (n = 202) or Gazyvaro in combination with bendamustine \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n(G+B) (n = 194) for 6 cycles, each of 28 days duration. Patients in the G+B arm who did not have \ndisease progression (i.e. patients with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable \ndisease (SD)) at the end of induction continued receiving Gazyvaro maintenance once every two \nmonths for two years or until disease progression (whichever occurred first). Patients were stratified \naccording to region, iNHL subtype (follicular versus non-follicular), rituximab-refractory type \n(whether refractory to prior rituximab monotherapy or rituximab in combination with chemotherapy) \nand the number of prior therapies (\u2264 2 versus > 2). \n \nThe demographic data and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms \n(median age 63 years, the majority were Caucasian [88%] and male [58%]). The majority of patients \nhad follicular lymphoma (81%). The median time from initial diagnosis was 3 years and the median \nnumber of prior therapies was 2 (range 1 to 10); 44% of patients had received 1 prior therapy and 34% \nof patients had received 2 prior therapies.  \n \nGazyvaro was given by intravenous infusion as a dose of 1,000 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, on \nDay 1 of Cycles 2-6, and in patients who did not have disease progression, once every two months for \ntwo years or until disease progression (whichever occurs first). Bendamustine was given intravenously \non Days 1 and 2 for all treatment cycles (Cycles 1-6) at 90 mg/m2/day when given in combination with \nGazyvaro or 120 mg/m2/day when given alone. In patients treated with G+ B, 79.4% received all six \ntreatment cycles compared to 66.7% of patients in the B arm. \n \nThe primary analysis, based on independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment demonstrated a \nstatistically significant - 45% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death, in patients with \niNHL receiving G+B followed by Gazyvaro maintenance, compared with patients receiving \nbendamustine alone. The reduction in the risk of disease progression or death seen in the iNHL \npopulation is driven by the subset of patients with FL. \n \nThe majority of the patients in study GAO4753g had FL (81.1%). Efficacy results from the primary \nanalysis in the FL population are shown in Table 9 and Figures 6 and 8. 11.6% of the patients had \nmarginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and 7.1% had small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In the non-FL \npopulation the HR for IRC-assessed PFS was 0.94 [95% CI: 0.49, 1.90].  No definitive conclusions \ncould be drawn on efficacy in the MZL and SLL sub-populations. \n \nAt final analysis, the median observation time was 45.9 months (range: 0-100.9 months) for FL \npatients in the B arm and 57.3 months (range: 0.4-97.6 months) for patients in the G+B arm, \nrepresenting an additional 25.6 months and 35.2 months of median follow-up in B and G+B arms, \nrespectively, since the primary analysis. Only Investigator (INV) assessed endpoints were reported at \nfinal analysis since IRC assessments did not continue. Overall, the investigator assessed efficacy \nresults were consistent with what was observed in the primary analysis. The overall survival (OS) in \npatients with FL was stable with longer follow-up (see Figure 7); the HR for risk of death was 0.71 \n(95%CI: 0.51, 0.98). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nTable 9 Summary of primary efficacy analysis in patients with FL# from \nGAO4753g/GADOLIN study \n\n \n  \n\n \nBendamustine \n\nN=166 \n\nGazyvaro + \nBendamustine \n\nfollowed by \nGazyvaro \n\nmaintenance \nN=155 \n\n \nMedian observation \n\ntime: 20 months \nMedian observation \n\ntime: 22 months \nPrimary Endpoint in FL population   \n\nIRC-assessed PFS (PFS-IRC)   \n\nNumber (%) of patients with event  90 (54.2%) 54 (34.8%) \n\nMedian time to event (months, 95% CI) 13.8 (11.4, 16.2) NR (22.5,-) \n\nHR (95% CI) 0.48 (0.34, 0.68) \np-value (Log-Rank test, stratified*) < 0.0001 \n\nSecondary Endpoints   \n\nInvestigator-assessed PFS (PFS-INV)   \n\nNumber (%) of patients with event  102 (61.4%) 62 (40.0%) \n\nMedian time to event (months, 95% CI) 13.7 (11.0, 15.5) 29.2 (17.5,-) \n\nHR (95% CI) 0.48 (0.35, 0.67) \n\np-value (Log-Rank test, stratified*) < 0.0001 \n\nBest Overall Response (BOR) (IRC-assessed)\u00a7   \n\nNo. of patients included in the analysis 161 153 \n\nResponders (%) (CR/PR) 124 (77.0%) 122 (79.7%) \n\nDifference in response rate (95% CI) 2.72 (-6.74, 12.18) \n\np-value (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) 0.6142 \n\nComplete Responders (%) 31 (19.3%) 24 (15.7%) \n\nPartial Responders (%) 93 (57.8%) 98 (64.1%) \n\nStable Disease (%) 18 (11.2%) 13 (8.5%) \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n  \n\nDuration of response (DOR) (IRC-\nassessed)   \n\nNo of patients included in the analysis 127 122 \n\nNo. (%) of patients with event 74 (58.3%) 36 (29.5%) \n\nMedian duration (months) of DOR (95% CI) 11.9 (8.8, 13.6) NR (25.4,-) \n\nHR (95% CI) 0.36 (0.24, 0.54) \n\nOverall Survival    \n\nNo. (%) of patients with event 36 (21.7%) 25 (16.1%) \n\nMedian time to event (months) NR NR \n\nHR (95% CI) 0.71 (0.43, 1.19) \n\np-value (Log-Rank test, stratified*) 0.1976 \nIRC: Independent Review Committee; PFS: progression-free survival; HR: Hazard Ratio; CI: Confidence Intervals,  \nNR = Not Reached \n# Patients with FL who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months after treatment with rituximab or \na rituximab-containing regimen \n*Stratification factors for analysis were refractory type (rituximab monotherapy vs. rituximab + chemotherapy) and \nprior therapies (\u2264 2 vs > 2).

Based \non the FACT-Lym questionnaire and EQ-5D index scale collected during the treatment and during \nfollow-up periods, health-related quality of life was generally maintained in the pivotal study with no \nmeaningful difference between the arms. However, in patients with FL the addition of Gazyvaro to \nbendamustine delayed the time to worsening of health-related quality of life as measured by the \nFACT-Lym TOI score by 2.2 months (median 5.6 versus 7.8 months for B and G+B respectively \nHR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.13). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nImmunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and \nspecificity, assay methodology, assay robustness to quantities of Gazyvaro/antibody in the circulation, \nsample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicines and underlying disease. For \nthese reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to Gazyvaro with the incidence of antibodies to \nother products may be misleading. \n \nPatients in the CLL pivotal study BO21004/CLL11 were tested at multiple time-points for \nanti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) to Gazyvaro. In patients treated with Gazyvaro 8 out of 140 patients \nin the randomised phase and 2 out of 6 in the run in phase tested positive for ATA at 12 months of \nfollow up. Of these patients, none experienced anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions that were \nconsidered related to ATA, nor was clinical response affected. \n \nNo post-baseline HAHA (Human Anti-Human Antibody) were observed in patients with iNHL treated \nin study GAO4753g/GADOLIN. In study BO21223/GALLIUM, 1/565 patient (0.2% of patients with \na post-baseline assessment) developed HAHA at induction completion. While the clinical significance \nof HAHA is not known, a potential correlation between HAHA and clinical course cannot be ruled \nout. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nGazyvaro in all subsets of the paediatric population in CLLand FL (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nA population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed to analyse the PK data in 469 iNHL, \n342 CLL and 130 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients from Phase I, Phase II and Phase \nIII studies who received obinutuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nObinutuzumab is administered intravenously, therefore absorption is not applicable. There have been \nno studies performed with other routes of administration. From the population PK model, after the \nCycle 6 Day 1 infusion in CLL patients, the estimated median Cmax value was 465.7 \u03bcg/mL and \nAUC(\u03c4) value was 8961 \u03bcg\u2022d/mL and in iNHL patients the estimated median Cmax value was \n539.3 \u03bcg/mL and AUC(\u03c4) value was 10956 \u03bcg\u2022day/mL. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of the central compartment (2.98 L \nin patients with CLL and 2.97 in patients with iNHL), approximates serum volume, which indicates \ndistribution is largely restricted to plasma and interstitial fluid. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nBiotransformation \n \nThe metabolism of obinutuzumab has not been directly studied. Antibodies are mostly cleared by \ncatabolism.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe clearance of obinutuzumab was approximately 0.11 L/day in CLL patients and 0.08 L/day in \niNHL patients with a median elimination t\u00bd of 26.4 days in CLL patients and 36.8 days in iNHL \npatients. Obinutuzumab elimination comprises two parallel pathways which describe clearance, a \nlinear clearance pathway and a non-linear clearance pathway which changes as a function of time. \nDuring the initial treatment, the non-linear time-varying clearance pathway is dominant and is \nconsequently the major clearance pathway. As treatment continues, the impact of this pathway \ndiminishes and the linear clearance pathway predominates. This is indicative of target mediated drug \ndisposition (TMDD), where the initial abundance of CD20 cells causes a rapid removal of \nobinutuzumab from the circulation. However, once the majority of CD20 cells are bound with \nobinutuzumab, the impact of TMDD on PK is minimised. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender was found to be a covariate which explains some \nof the inter-patient variability, with a 22% greater steady state clearance (CLss) and a 19% greater \nvolume of distribution (V) in males. However, results from the population analysis have shown that \nthe differences in exposure are not significant (with an estimated median AUC and Cmax in CLL \npatients of 11282 \u00b5g\u2022d/mL and 578.9 \u00b5g/mL in females and 8451 \u00b5g\u2022d/mL and 432.5 \u00b5g/mL in males, \nrespectively at Cycle 6 and AUC and Cmax in iNHL of 13172 \u00b5g\u2022d/mL and 635.7 \u00b5g/mL in females \nand 9769 \u00b5g\u2022d/mL and 481.3 \u00b5g/mL in males, respectively), indicating that there is no need to dose \nadjust based on gender. \n \nElderly \n \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis of obinutuzumab showed that age did not affect the \npharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab. No significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of \nobinutuzumab among patients < 65 years (n=375), patients between 65-75 years (n=265) and patients \n> 75 years (n=171). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab in paediatric \npatients. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nThe population pharmacokinetic analysis of obinutuzumab showed that creatinine clearance does not \naffect pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab. Pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab in patients with mild \ncreatinine clearance (CrCl 50-89 mL/min, n=464) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 49 mL/min, n=106) renal \nimpairment were similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CrCl \u2265 90 mL/min, n=383). \nPharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-29 mL/min) is limited (n=8), \ntherefore no dose recommendations can be made. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of obinutuzumab. \n \nNo specific studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of obinutuzumab on fertility. \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys obinutuzumab had no adverse effects on male \nand female reproductive organs. \n \nAn enhanced pre and postnatal development (ePPND) toxicity study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys \nshowed no evidence of teratogenic effects. However, weekly obinutuzumab dosing from post-coitum \nday 20 to delivery resulted in complete depletion of B-cells in infant monkeys at weekly intravenous \nobinutuzumab doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg (2-5 times the clinical exposure based on Cmax and AUC). \nOffspring exposure on day 28 post-partum suggests that obinutuzumab can cross the blood-placenta \nbarrier. Concentrations in infant serum on day 28 post-partum were in the range of concentrations in \nmaternal serum, whereas concentrations in milk on the same day were very low (less than 0.5% of the \ncorresponding maternal serum levels) suggesting that exposure of infants must have occurred in utero. \nThe B-cell counts returned to normal levels, and immunologic function was restored within 6 months \npost-partum.  \n \nIn a 26-week cynomolgus monkey study, hypersensitivity reactions were noted and attributed to the \nforeign recognition of the humanised antibody in cynomolgus monkeys (0.7-6 times the clinical \nexposure based on Cmax and AUC at steady state after weekly administration of 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg). \nFindings included acute anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions and an increased prevalence of \nsystemic inflammation and infiltrates consistent with immune-complex mediated hypersensitivity \nreactions, such as arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephritis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation. \nThese reactions led to unscheduled termination of 6/36 animals treated with obinutuzumab during \ndosing and recovery phases; these changes were partially reversible. No renal toxicity with a causal \nrelationship to obinutuzumab has been observed in humans. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Gazyvaro is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Gazyvaro \n3. How Gazyvaro is given \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Gazyvaro \n6. Content of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Gazyvaro is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Gazyvaro is \n \nGazyvaro contains the active substance obinutuzumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d. Antibodies work by attaching themselves to specific targets in your body. \n \nWhat Gazyvaro is used for \n \nGazyvaro can be used in adults to treat two different types of cancer \n \n\u2022 Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (also called \u201cCLL\u201d) \n\n- Gazyvaro is used in patients who have not had any treatment for CLL before and who \nhave other illnesses which make it unlikely that they would be able to tolerate a full dose \nof a different medicine used to treat CLL called fludarabine. \n\n- Gazyvaro is used together with another medicine for cancer called chlorambucil. \n \n\u2022 Follicular lymphoma (also called \u201cFL\u201d) \n\n- Gazyvaro is used in patients who have not had any treatment for FL  \n- Gazyvaro is used in patients who have had at least one treatment with a medicine called \n\nrituximab before and whose FL has come back or got worse during or after this treatment.  \n- At the start of treatment for FL, Gazyvaro is used together with other medicines for \n\ncancer.  \n- Gazyvaro can then be used on its own for up to 2 years as a \u201cmaintenance treatment\u201d. \n\n \nHow Gazyvaro works \n \n\u2022 CLL and FL are types of cancer that affect white blood cells called \u201cB-lymphocytes\u201d. The \n\naffected \u201cB-lymphocytes\u201d multiply too quickly and live too long. Gazyvaro binds to targets on \nthe surface of the affected \u201cB-lymphocyte\u201d cells and causes them to die.   \n\n\u2022 When Gazyvaro is given to patients with CLL or FL together with other medicines for  \ncancer - this slows down the time it takes for their disease to get worse. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Gazyvaro \n \nYou must not be given Gazyvaro if: \n \n\u2022 you are allergic to obinutuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nIf you are not sure talk to your doctor or nurse before being given Gazyvaro. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Gazyvaro if: \n\u2022 you have an infection, or have had an infection in the past which lasted a long time or keeps \n\ncoming back  \n\u2022 you have ever taken, or been given, medicines which affect your immune system (such as \n\nchemotherapy or immunosuppressants) \n\u2022 you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or medicines used to thin your blood \u2013 your \n\ndoctor might need to alter how you take these \n\u2022 you have ever had heart problems \n\u2022 you have ever had brain problems (such as memory problems, difficulty moving or feeling \n\nsensations in your body, eyesight problems) \n\u2022 you have ever had breathing problems or lung problems \n\u2022 you have ever had  \u201chepatitis B\u201d - a type of liver disease  \n\u2022 you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given \nGazyvaro.  \n \nPay attention to the following side effects  \n \nGazyvaro can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight \naway. These include:  \n \nInfusion related reactions  \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion related reactions listed at \n\nthe start of section 4. Infusion related reactions can happen during the infusion or up to 24 hours \nafter the infusion.  \n\n\u2022 If you get an infusion related reaction, you may require additional treatment, or the infusion \nmay need to be slowed down or stopped. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the \ninfusion can be continued. These reactions are more likely to happen with the first infusion. \nYour doctor may decide to stop treatment with Gazyvaro if you have a severe infusion related \nreaction. \n\n\u2022 Before each infusion of Gazyvaro, you will be given medicines which help to reduce possible \ninfusion related reactions or \u201ctumour lysis syndrome\u201d.  Tumour lysis syndrome is a potentially \nlife-threatening complication, caused by chemical changes in the blood due to the breakdown of \ndying cancer cells (see section 3). \n\n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (also called \u201cPML\u201d) \n \n\u2022 PML is a very rare and life-threatening brain infection that has been reported in very few \n\npatients having treatment with Gazyvaro.  \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have memory loss, trouble speaking, difficulty \n\nwalking or problems with your eyesight.  \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n\u2022 If you had any of these symptoms before treatment with Gazyvaro, tell your doctor straight \naway if you notice any changes in them. You may need medical treatment. \n\n \nInfections  \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any signs of infection after your Gazyvaro \n\ntreatment (see \"Infections\" in section 4). \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give Gazyvaro to children or young people under 18 years of age. This is because there is no \ninformation about its use in these age groups.  \n \nOther medicines and Gazyvaro \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.  \n \nPregnancy  \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to \n\nhave a baby. They will help you weigh up the benefit of continuing Gazyvaro against the risk to \nyour baby.  \n\n\u2022 If you become pregnant during treatment with Gazyvaro, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as \npossible. This is because treatment with Gazyvaro may affect yours or the baby\u2019s health.  \n\n \nBreast-feeding \n \n\u2022 Do not breast-feed during treatment with Gazyvaro or for 18 months after stopping treatment \n\nwith Gazyvaro. This is because small amounts of the medicine may pass into your breast milk. \n \nContraception \n \n\u2022 Use an effective method of contraception while being treated with Gazyvaro. \n\u2022 Continue to use effective contraception for 18 months after stopping treatment with Gazyvaro.  \n \nDriving and using machines  \n \nGazyvaro is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. However, if \nyou get an infusion related reaction, (see section 4), do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines \nuntil the reaction stops. \n \n \n3. How Gazyvaro is given \n \nHow Gazyvaro is given \n \nGazyvaro is given under the supervision of a doctor experienced in such treatment. It is given into a \nvein as a drip (intravenous infusion) over several hours. \n \nThe Gazyvaro treatment \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \n\u2022 You will be given 6 treatment cycles of Gazyvaro in combination with another medicine for \n\ncancer called chlorambucil. Each cycle lasts 28 days.  \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n\u2022 On Day 1 of your first cycle, you will be given part of your first Gazyvaro dose of 100 \nmilligrams (mg) very slowly. Your doctor/nurse will monitor you carefully for infusion related \nreactions.  \n\n\u2022 If you do not have an infusion related reaction following the small part of your first dose, you \nmay be given the rest of your first dose (900 mg) on the same day.  \n\n\u2022 If you do have an infusion related reaction following the small part of your first dose, you will \nbe given the rest of your first dose on Day 2. \n\n \nA typical schedule is shown below.  \nCycle 1 - this will include three doses of Gazyvaro in the 28 days: \n\u2022 Day 1 \u2013 part of your first dose (100 mg) \n\u2022 Day 2 or Day 1 (continued) \u2013 remainder of first dose 900 mg \n\u2022 Day 8 \u2013 full dose (1,000 mg) \n\u2022 Day 15 \u2013 full dose (1,000 mg) \n \nCycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6  this will be just one dose of Gazyvaro in the 28 days: \n\u2022 Day 1 \u2013 full dose (1,000 mg). \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \n\u2022 You will be given 6 or 8 treatment cycles of Gazyvaro in combination with other medicines for \n\ncancer - each cycle lasts 28 or 21 days depending on which other cancer medicines are given \ntogether with Gazyvaro. \n\n\u2022 This induction phase will be followed by a \u201cmaintenance phase\u201d - during this time you will be \ngiven Gazyvaro every 2 months for up to 2 years as long as your disease does not progress. \nBased on your disease status after the initial treatment cycles your doctor will decide whether \nyou will receive treatment in the maintenance phase. \n\n\u2022 A typical schedule is shown below.  \n \nInduction phase \n \nCycle 1 - this will include three doses of Gazyvaro in the 28 or 21 days depending on which other \ncancer medicines are given together with Gazyvaro: \n\u2022 Day 1 - full dose (1,000 mg) \n\u2022 Day 8 - full dose (1,000 mg) \n\u2022 Day 15 - full dose (1,000 mg). \n\n \nCycles 2-6 or 2-8 - this will be just one dose of Gazyvaro in the 28 or 21 days depending on which \nother cancer medicines are given together with Gazyvaro: \n\u2022 Day 1 - full dose (1,000 mg). \n \nMaintenance phase \n \n\u2022 Full dose (1,000 mg) once every 2 months for up to 2 years as long as your disease does not \n\nprogress. \n \nMedicines given before each infusion  \n \nBefore each infusion of Gazyvaro, you will be given medicines to lessen the chance of getting infusion \nrelated reactions or tumour lysis syndrome. These may include: \n \n\u2022 fluids  \n\u2022 medicines to reduce a fever \n\u2022 medicines to reduce pain (analgesics) \n\u2022 medicines to reduce inflammation (corticosteroids)  \n\u2022 medicines to reduce an allergic reaction (anti-histamines) \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n\u2022 medicine to prevent tumour lysis syndrome (such as allopurinol). \n \nIf you miss a Gazyvaro treatment \n \nIf you miss your appointment, make another one as soon as possible. This is because for this medicine \nto be as effective as possible, it is important to follow the dosing schedule.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.

All patients considered at risk should be carefully \nmonitored during the initial days of treatment with a special focus on renal function, potassium, and \nuric acid values. Any additional guidelines according to standard practice should be followed. \n \nProphylaxis and premedication for infusion related reactions (IRRs) \n \nPremedication to reduce the risk of IRRs is outlined in Table 1. Corticosteroid premedication is \nrecommended for patients with FL and mandatory for CLL patients in the first cycle (see Table 1). \nPremedication for subsequent infusions and other premedication should be administered as described \nbelow. \n \nHypotension, as a symptom of IRRs, may occur during Gazyvaro intravenous infusions. Therefore, \nwithholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout \neach Gazyvaro infusion and for the first hour after administration.  \n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nTable 1 Premedication to be administered before Gazyvaro infusion to reduce the risk of \nIRRsin CLL and FL patients \n\n \nDay of \ntreatment \ncycle \n\nPatients requiring \npremedication Premedication Administration \n\nCycle 1: \nDay 1 for \nCLL and \nFL \n\nAll patients \n\nIntravenous \ncorticosteroid1,4 \n\n(mandatory for CLL, \nrecommended for FL)  \n\nCompleted at least \n1 hour prior to Gazyvaro \ninfusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2  At least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion Anti-histaminic medicine3  \n\nCycle 1: \nDay 2 for \nCLL only \n\nAll patients \n\nIntravenous corticosteroid1 \n(mandatory)  \n\nCompleted at least \n1 hour prior to Gazyvaro \ninfusion  \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2  At least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion Anti-histaminic medicine3  \n\nAll \nsubsequent \ninfusions for \nCLL and \nFL \n \n \n\nPatients with no IRR \nduring the previous \ninfusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2 At least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion Patients with an IRR \n\n(Grade 1 or 2) with the \nprevious infusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2 \nAnti-histaminic medicine3  \n\nPatients with a Grade 3 \nIRR with the previous \ninfusion OR  \nPatients with \nlymphocyte counts \n>25 x 109/L prior to \nnext treatment \n\nIntravenous \ncorticosteroid1,4 \n  \n\nCompleted at least \n1 hour prior to Gazyvaro \ninfusion \n\nOral analgesic/anti-pyretic2 \nAnti-histaminic medicine3 \n\nAt least 30 minutes \nbefore Gazyvaro \ninfusion \n\n1100 mg prednisone/prednisolone or 20 mg dexamethasone or 80 mg methylprednisolone.

If the first bag is completed without modifications of the infusion rate or interruptions, the \nsecond bag may be administered on the same day (no dose delay necessary, no repetition of \npremedication), provided that appropriate time, conditions and medical supervision are available \nthroughout the infusion. If there are any modifications of the infusion rate or interruptions during the \nfirst 100 mg the second bag must be administered the following day.  \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \nCycles 2 \u2013 6 \n \nThe recommended dose of Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is 1,000 mg administered on \nDay 1 of each cycle. \n \nTable 2 Dose of Gazyvaro to be administered during 6 treatment cycles each of 28 days \n\nduration for patients with CLL \n \n\nCycle Day of treatment Dose of Gazyvaro \n\nCycle 1 \n\nDay 1 100 mg \n\nDay 2 (or Day 1 continued) 900 mg \n\nDay 8 1,000 mg \n\nDay 15 1,000 mg \n\nCycles 2-6 Day 1 1,000 mg \n1 Chlorambucil is given orally at 0.5 mg/kg body weight on Day 1 and Day 15 of all treatment cycles \n \nDuration of treatment \nSix treatment cycles, each of 28 day duration. \n \nFollicular lymphoma  \n \nFor patients with FL, the recommended dose of Gazyvaro in combination with chemotherapy is shown \nin Table 3. \n \nPatients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma \n \nInduction (in combination with chemotherapy2) \nGazyvaro should be administered with chemotherapy as follows: \n \n\u2022 Six 28-day cycles in combination with bendamustine2 or \n\u2022 Six 21-day cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \n\nprednisolone (CHOP), followed by 2 additional cycles of Gazyvaro alone or \n\u2022 Eight 21-day cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and \n\nprednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone (CVP).  \n \n\nMaintenance  \n \nPatients who achieve a complete or partial response to induction treatment with Gazyvaro in \ncombination with chemotherapy should continue to receive Gazyvaro 1,000 mg as single agent \nmaintenance therapy once every 2 months for 2 years or until disease progression (whichever occurs \nfirst). \n \nPatients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond or who progressed during or up to 6 months \nafter treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen  \n \nInduction (in combination with bendamustine2) \n \nGazyvaro should be administered in six 28-day cycles in combination with bendamustine2.  \n \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nMaintenance  \n \nPatients who achieved a complete or partial response to induction treatment (i.e. the initial 6 treatment \ncycles) with Gazyvaro in combination with bendamustine or have stable disease should continue to \nreceive Gazyvaro 1,000 mg as single agent maintenance therapy once every 2 months for 2 years or \nuntil disease progression (whichever occurs first). \n \nTable 3 Follicular lymphoma: Dose of Gazyvaro to be administered during induction \n\ntreatment, followed by maintenance treatment \n \n\nCycle Day of treatment  Dose of Gazyvaro \n\nCycle 1 \n \n\nDay 1 1,000 mg \n\nDay 8 1,000 mg \n\nDay 15 1,000 mg \n\nCycles 2\u20136 or \n2-8 Day 1 1,000 mg \n\nMaintenance \nEvery 2 months for 2 years \nor until disease progression \n\n(whichever occurs first)  \n1,000 mg \n\n2 Bendamustine is given intravenously on Days 1 and 2 of all treatment cycles (Cycles 1-6) at 90 mg/m2/day; CHOP and \nCVP according to standard regimens \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nInduction treatment of approximately six months (six treatment cycles of Gazyvaro, each of 28 day \nduration when combined with bendamustine, or eight treatment cycles of Gazyvaro, each of 21 day \nduration when combined with CHOP or CVP) followed by maintenance once every 2 months for 2 \nyears or until disease progression (whichever occurs first). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nGazyvaro is for intravenous use.

Upon resolution \n\nof symptoms, the infusion can be restarted at no more than half the previous rate (the rate being \nused at the time that the IRR occurred) and, if the patient does not experience any IRR \nsymptoms, the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate \nfor the treatment dose (see Tables 4 and 5). For CLL patients receiving the Day 1 (Cycle 1) dose \nsplit over two days, the Day 1 infusion rate may be increased back up to 25 mg/hr after 1 hour, \nbut not increased further.  \nThe infusion must be stopped and therapy permanently discontinued if the patient experiences a \nsecond occurrence of a Grade 3 IRR. \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n\u2022 Grade 1-2 (mild to moderate): The infusion rate must be reduced and symptoms treated.  \nInfusion can be continued upon resolution of symptoms and, if the patient does not experience \nany IRR symptoms, the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as \nappropriate for the treatment dose (see Tables 4 and 5). For CLL patients receiving the Day 1 \n(Cycle 1) dose split over two days, the Day 1 infusion rate may be increased back up to \n25 mg/hr after 1 hour, but not increased further. \n\n \nInstructions for dilution \n \nGazyvaro should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Do not shake the \nvial. Use a sterile needle and syringe to prepare Gazyvaro.  \n \nFor CLL cycles 2 \u2013 6 and all FL cycles \n \nWithdraw 40 mL of concentrate from the vial and dilute in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or non-PVC \npolyolefin infusion bags containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  \n \nCLL only \u2013 Cycle 1 \n \nTo ensure differentiation of the two infusion bags for the initial 1,000 mg dose, it is recommended to \nutilise bags of different sizes to distinguish between the 100 mg dose for Cycle 1 Day 1 and the \n900 mg dose for Cycle 1 Day 1 (continued) or Day 2. To prepare the 2 infusion bags, withdraw 40 mL \nof concentrate from the vial and dilute 4 mL into a 100 mL PVC or non-PVC polyolefin infusion bag \nand the remaining 36 mL in a 250 mL PVC or non-PVC polyolefin infusion bag containing sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection.

different types of cancer chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (also called \"cll\") - gazyvaro is used in patients who have not had any treatment for cll before and who have other illnesses which make it unlikely that they would be able to tolerate a full dose of a different medicine used to treat cll called fludarabine. - gazyvaro is used together with another medicine for cancer called chlorambucil. follicular lymphoma (also called \"fl\") - gazyvaro is used in patients who have not had any treatment for fl - gazyvaro is used in patients who have had at least one treatment with a medicine called rituximab before and whose fl has come back or got worse during or after this treatment. - at the start of treatment for fl, gazyvaro is used together with other medicines for cancer. - gazyvaro can then be used on its own for up to 2 years as a \"maintenance treatment\". how gazyvaro works cll and fl are types of cancer that affect white blood cells called \"b-lymphocytes\". the affected \"b-lymphocytes\" multiply too quickly and live too long. gazyvaro binds to targets on the surface of the affected \"b-lymphocyte\" cells and causes them to die. when gazyvaro is given to patients

or nurse before being given gazyvaro. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given gazyvaro if: you have an infection, or have had an infection in the past which lasted a long time or keeps coming back you have ever taken, or been given, medicines which affect your immune system (such as chemotherapy or immunosuppressants) you are taking medicines for high blood pressure or medicines used to thin your blood your doctor might need to alter how you take these you have ever had heart problems you have ever had brain problems (such as memory problems, difficulty

vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given gazyvaro. pay attention to the following side effects gazyvaro can cause some serious side effects that you need to tell your doctor or nurse about straight away. these include: infusion related reactions tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the infusion related reactions listed at the start of section 4. infusion related reactions can happen during the infusion or up to 24 hours after the infusion. if you get an infusion related reaction, you may require additional treatment, or the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. when these symptoms go away, or improve, the infusion can be continued. these reactions are more likely to happen with the first infusion. your doctor may decide to stop treatment with gazyvaro if you have a severe infusion related reaction. before each infusion of gazyvaro, you will be given medicines which help to reduce possible infusion related reactions or \"tumour lysis syndrome\". tumour lysis syndrome is a potentially life-threatening complication, caused by chemical changes in the blood due to the breakdown of dying cancer cells (see section 3). progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (also called \"pml\") pml is a very rare and life-threatening brain infection that has been reported in very few patients having treatment with gazyvaro. tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have memory loss, trouble speaking, difficulty walking or problems with your eyesight. if you had any of these symptoms before treatment with gazyvaro, tell your doctor straight away if you notice any changes in them. you may need medical treatment. infections tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any signs of infection after your gazyvaro treatment (see \"infections\" in section 4). children and adolescents do not give gazyvaro to children or young people under 18 years of age. this is because there is no information about its use in these age groups. other medicines and gazyvaro tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might start taking any other medicines. this includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. pregnancy tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. they will help you weigh up the benefit of continuing gazyvaro against the risk to your baby. if you become pregnant during treatment with gazyvaro, tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. this is because treatment with gazyvaro may affect yours or the baby's health. breast-feeding do not breast-feed during treatment with gazyvaro or for 18 months after stopping treatment with gazyvaro. this is because small amounts of the medicine may pass into your breast milk. contraception use an effective method of contraception while being treated with gazyvaro. continue to use effective contraception for 18 months after stopping treatment with gazyvaro. driving and using machines gazyvaro is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. however, if you get an infusion related reaction, (see section 4), do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machines until the reaction

gazyvaro is given under the supervision of a doctor experienced in such treatment. it is given into a vein as a drip (intravenous infusion) over several hours. the gazyvaro treatment chronic lymphocytic leukaemia you will be given 6 treatment cycles of gazyvaro in combination with another medicine for cancer called chlorambucil. each cycle lasts 28 days. on day 1 of your first cycle, you will be given part of your first gazyvaro dose of 100 milligrams (mg) very slowly. your doctor/nurse will monitor you carefully for infusion related reactions. if you do not have an infusion related reaction following the small part of your first dose, you may be given the rest of your first dose (900 mg) on the same day. if you do have an infusion related reaction following the small part of your first dose, you will be given the rest of your first dose on day 2. a typical schedule is shown below. cycle 1 - this will include three doses of gazyvaro in the 28 days: day 1 part of your first dose (100 mg) day 2 or day 1 (continued) remainder of first dose 900 mg day 8 full dose (1,000 mg) day 15 full dose (1,000 mg) cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 this will be just one dose of gazyvaro in the 28 days: day 1 full dose (1,000 mg). follicular lymphoma you will be given 6 or 8 treatment cycles of gazyvaro in combination with other medicines for cancer - each cycle lasts 28 or 21 days depending on which other cancer medicines are given together with gazyvaro. this induction phase will be followed by a \"maintenance phase\" - during this time you will be given gazyvaro every 2 months for up to 2 years as long as your disease does not progress. based on your disease status after the initial treatment cycles your doctor will decide whether you will receive treatment in the maintenance phase. a typical schedule is shown below. induction phase cycle 1 - this will include three doses of gazyvaro in the 28 or 21 days depending on which other cancer medicines are given together with gazyvaro: day 1 - full dose (1,000 mg) day 8 - full dose (1,000 mg) day 15 - full dose (1,000 mg). cycles 2-6 or 2-8 - this will be just one dose of gazyvaro in the 28 or 21 days depending on which other cancer medicines are given together with gazyvaro: day 1 - full dose (1,000 mg). maintenance phase full dose (1,000 mg) once every 2 months for up to 2 years as long as your disease does not progress. medicines given before each infusion before each infusion of gazyvaro, you will be given medicines to lessen the chance of getting infusion related reactions or tumour lysis syndrome. these may include: fluids medicines to reduce a fever medicines to reduce pain (analgesics) medicines to reduce inflammation (corticosteroids) medicines to reduce an allergic reaction (anti-histamines) 48 medicine to prevent tumour lysis syndrome (such as allopurinol). if you miss a gazyvaro treatment if you miss your appointment, make another one as soon as possible. this is because for this medicine
