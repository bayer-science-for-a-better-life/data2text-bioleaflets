PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nThe powder or cake is white. \nThe solvent is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nNimenrix is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 6 weeks against invasive \nmeningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135, and Y. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nNimenrix should be used in accordance with available official recommendations. \n \nPrimary immunisation \nInfants from 6 weeks to less than 6 months of age: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, should be administered \nwith an interval of 2 months between doses. \n \nInfants from 6 months of age, children, adolescents and adults: a single 0.5 mL dose should be \nadministered.  \nAn additional primary dose of Nimenrix may be considered appropriate for some individuals (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nBooster doses \nAfter completion of the primary immunisation course in infants 6 weeks to less than 12 months of age, \na booster dose should be given at 12 months of age with an interval of at least 2 months after the last \nNimenrix vaccination (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIn previously vaccinated individuals 12 months of age and older, Nimenrix may be given as a booster \ndose if they have received primary vaccination with a conjugated or plain polysaccharide \nmeningococcal vaccine (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection only. \n \nIn infants, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals from \n1 year of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid \nmuscle (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nNimenrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly, intradermally or \nsubcutaneously. \n \nIt is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with \nregard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical \nexamination. \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIntercurrent illness \n \nVaccination with Nimenrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile \nillness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of \nvaccination. \n \nSyncope \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as \na psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological \nsigns such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during \nrecovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \n \nNimenrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nImmunodeficiency \n \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with \nimmunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nPersons with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons \nreceiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at \nincreased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, even \nif they develop antibodies following vaccination with Nimenrix. \n \nProtection against meningococcal disease \n \nNimenrix will only confer protection against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The \nvaccine will not protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. \n \nEffect of prior vaccination with plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine \nSubjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine and vaccinated \nwith Nimenrix 30 to 42 months later had lower Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) measured with a \nserum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA) than subjects who had not been vaccinated \nwith any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of \nthis observation is unknown. \n \nEffect of pre-vaccination antibody to tetanus toxoid \nThe safety and immunogenicity of Nimenrix was evaluated when it was sequentially administered or \nco-administered with a vaccine containing, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis, \ninactivated polioviruses (1, 2 and 3), hepatitis B surface antigen and Haemophilus influenzae type b \npolyribosyl ribose phosphate conjugated to tetanus toxoid (DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib) in the second year of \nlife. The administration of Nimenrix one month after the DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine resulted in \nlower rSBA GMTs against groups A, C and W-135 compared with co-administration (see section 4.5). \nThe clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. \n \nImmune response in infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months \nA single dose administered at 6 months was associated with lower human complement serum \nbactericidal assay (hSBA) titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with three doses administered at 2, \n4, and 6 months (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. If an infant \naged 6 months to less than 12 months is expected to be at particular risk of invasive meningococcal \ndisease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, consideration may be given to administering a \nsecond primary dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. \n \nImmune responses in toddlers aged 12-14 months \nToddlers aged 12-14 months had similar rSBA titres to groups A, C, W-135 and Y at one month after \none dose of Nimenrix or at one month after two doses of Nimenrix given two months apart. \n \nA single dose was associated with lower hSBA titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with two \ndoses given two months apart. Similar responses to groups A and C were observed after one or two \ndoses (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of the findings is unknown. If a toddler is expected to be \nat particular risk of invasive meningococcal disease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, \nconsideration may be given to administering a second dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. \nRegarding waning of antibody against group A or group C after a first dose of Nimenrix in children \naged 12-23 months, see under Persistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres. \n \nPersistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres \n \nFollowing administration of Nimenrix there is a waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against \ngroup A when using hSBA (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. \nHowever, if an individual is expected to be at particular risk of exposure to group A and received a \ndose of Nimenrix more than approximately one year previously, consideration may be given to \nadministering a booster dose. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nA decline in antibody titres over time has been observed for groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The clinical \nrelevance of this observation is unknown. A booster dose might be considered in individuals \nvaccinated at toddler age remaining at high risk of exposure to meningococcal disease caused by \ngroups A, C, W-135 or Y (see section 5.1). \n \nEffect of Nimenrix on anti-tetanus antibody concentrations \n \nAlthough an increase of the anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) antibody concentrations was observed following \nvaccination with Nimenrix, Nimenrix does not substitute for tetanus immunisation. \n \nGiving Nimenrix with or one month before a TT-containing vaccine in the second year of life does not \nimpair the response to TT or significantly affect safety. No data are available beyond the age of \n2 years. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines and \nwith 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nFrom age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: \nhepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, \nmeasles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or \nunadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. \n \nIn the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - \ntetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, \ninactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-\nIPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nIn individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus \nbivalent [Type 16 and 18] vaccine, recombinant (HPV2). \n \nWhenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, \nshould be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT \ncontaining vaccine. \n \nOne month after co-administration with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, lower \nGeometric Mean antibody Concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) antibody \nGMTs were observed for one pneumococcal serotype (18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier \nprotein). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. There was no impact of \nco-administration on immune responses to the other nine pneumococcal serotypes. \n \nOne month after co-administration with a combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and \nacellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap) in subjects aged 9 to 25 years, lower GMCs were \nobserved to each pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and \npertactin [PRN]). More than 98% of subjects had anti-PT, FHA or PRN concentrations above the \nassay cut-off thresholds. The clinical relevance of these observations is unknown. There was no \nimpact of co-administration on immune responses to Nimenrix or the tetanus or diphtheria antigens \nincluded in Tdap. \n \nIf Nimenrix is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always \nbe administered at different injection sites. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, an adequate response may \nnot be elicited. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is limited experience with use of Nimenrix in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). \n \nNimenrix should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed, and the possible advantages \noutweigh the potential risks for the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Nimenrix is excreted in human milk. \n \nNimenrix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the \npotential risks. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Nimenrix on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nHowever, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may affect the ability \nto drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Nimenrix presented in the table below is based on two clinical study datasets as follows:  \n\n\uf0b7 A pooled analysis of data from 9,621 subjects administered a single dose of Nimenrix. This total \nincluded 3,079 toddlers (12 months to 23 months), 909 children between 2 and 5 years of age, \n990 children between 6 and 10 years of age, 2,317 adolescents (11 to 17 years) and 2,326 adults \n(18 to 55 years). \n\n\uf0b7 Data from a study in infants aged 6 to 12 weeks at the time of the first dose (Study \nMenACWY-TT-083), 1,052 subjects received at least one dose of a primary series of 2 or 3 \ndoses of Nimenrix and 1,008 received a booster dose at approximately 12 months of age. \n\n \nSafety data have also been evaluated in a separate study, in which a single dose of Nimenrix was \nadministered to 274 individuals aged 56 years and older. \n \nLocal and general adverse reactions \nIn the 6-12 weeks and in the 12-14 months age groups who received 2 doses of Nimenrix given \n2 months apart, the first and second doses were associated with similar local and systemic \nreactogenicity. \n \nThe local and general adverse reaction profile of a booster dose of Nimenrix given to subjects from \n12 months through 30 years of age after primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other conjugated or \nplain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines, was similar to the local and general adverse reaction \n\n\n\n7 \n\nprofile observed after primary vaccination with Nimenrix, except for gastrointestinal symptoms \n(including diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea), which were very common among subjects 6 years of age \nand older. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: \n \nVery common: (\u22651/10) \nCommon: (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare:   (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from available data) \n \nTable 1 shows the adverse reactions reported from the studies in subjects aged from 6 weeks up to \n55 years of age and post-marketing experience. Adverse reactions reported in subjects aged >55 years \nwere similar to those observed in younger adults. \n \nTable 1: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions by system organ class \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Appetite lost \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n \n\nVery common Irritability\nUncommon Insomnia \n\nCrying\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Drowsiness \nHeadache\n\nUncommon Hypoaesthesia \nDizziness\n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea*\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Pruritus \nRash**\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Myalgia \nPain in extremity\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\nVery common Fever \nSwelling at injection site \nPain at injection site \nRedness at injection site \nFatigue\n\nCommon Injection site haematoma* \nUncommon Malaise \n\nInjection site induration \nInjection site pruritus \nInjection site warmth \nInjection site anaesthesia\n\n Not known*** Extensive limb swelling at the injection site, \nfrequently associated with erythema, \nsometimes involving the adjacent joint or \nswelling of the entire injected limb \n\n*Nausea and Injection site haematoma occurred at a frequency of Uncommon in infants \n**Rash occurred at a frequency of Common in infants \n***ADR identified post-marketing \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAnti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal disease via complement \nmediated bactericidal activity. Nimenrix induces the production of bactericidal antibodies against \ncapsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y when measured by \nassays using either rSBA or hSBA. \n \nImmunogenicity in infants \n \nIn Study MenACWY-TT-083, the first dose was administered at 6 to 12 weeks of age, the second after \nan interval of 2 months, and a third (booster) dose administered at approximately 12 months of age. \nDTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib and a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine were co-administered. Nimenrix elicited \nrSBA and hSBA titres against the four meningococcal groups as shown in Table 2. The response \nagainst group C was non-inferior to the one elicited by licensed MenC-CRM and MenC-TT vaccines \nin terms of percentages with rSBA titres \u22658 at 1 month after the second dose.  \n \nData from this study support the extrapolation of the immunogenicity data and posology to infants \nfrom 12 weeks to less than 6 months of age. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nTable 2: rSBA and hSBA titres following two doses of Nimenrix (or MenC-CRM or MenC-TT) \n\ngiven 2 months apart with the first dose administered to infants 6-12 weeks of age and \nfollowing a booster at 12 months of age (Study MenACWY-TT-083) \n\nMeningo-\ncoccal \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nTime \npoint \n\nrSBA* hSBA** \n\nN \n\uf0b38\uf020 GMT \n\nN \n\uf0b38\uf020 GMT \n\n(95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI) \n\nA Nimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 456 \n\n97.4% \n(95.4; 98.6)\n\n203 \n(182; 227) 202 \n\n96.5%  \n(93.0; 98.6) \n\n157  \n(131; 188)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1)  462 \n\n99.6%  \n(98.4; 99.9)\n\n1561  \n(1412; 1725) 214 \n\n99.5% \n(97.4;100) \n\n1007 \n(836;1214)\n\nC \n\nNimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 456 \n\n98.7%  \n(97.2; 99.5)\n\n612  \n(540; 693) 218 \n\n98.6%  \n(96.0; 99.7) \n\n1308  \n(1052; 1627)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 463 \n\n99.8%  \n(98.8; 100)\n\n1177  \n(1059; 1308) 221 \n\n99.5%  \n(97.5; 100) \n\n4992  \n(4086; 6100)\n\nMenC-\nCRM \n\nvaccine \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 455 \n\n99.6%  \n(98.4; 99.9)\n\n958  \n(850; 1079) 202 \n\n100%  \n(98.2; 100) \n\n3188  \n(2646; 3841)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 446 \n\n98.4%  \n(96.8; 99.4)\n\n1051  \n(920; 1202) 216 \n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n5438  \n(4412; 6702)\n\nMenC-\nTT \n\nvaccine \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 457 \n\n100%  \n(99.2; 100)\n\n1188  \n(1080; 1307) 226 \n\n100%  \n(98.4; 100) \n\n2626  \n(2219; 3109)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 459 \n\n100%  \n(99.2; 100)\n\n1960  \n(1776; 2163) 219 \n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n5542  \n(4765; 6446)\n\nW Nimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 455 \n\n99.1%  \n(97.8; 99.8)\n\n1605  \n(1383; 1862) 217 \n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n753 \n(644; 882)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 462 \n\n99.8%  \n(98.8; 100)\n\n2777  \n(2485; 3104) 218 \n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n5123  \n(4504; 5826)\n\nY Nimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 456 \n\n98.2%  \n(96.6; 99.2)\n\n483  \n(419; 558) 214 \n\n97.7%  \n(94.6; 99.2) \n\n328  \n(276; 390)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 462 \n\n99.4%  \n(99.1; 99.9)\n\n881  \n(787; 986) 217 \n\n100% \n(98.3; 100) \n\n2954  \n(2498; 3493)\n\nThe analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the primary according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort. \n*rSBA analysis performed at Public Health England (PHE) laboratories in UK \n**hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories \n(1) blood sampling performed 21 to 48 days post vaccination\n \nIn Study MenACWY-TT-087, infants received either a single primary dose at 6 months followed by a \nbooster dose at 15-18 months (DTaP-IPV/Hib and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was \nco-administered at both vaccination time points) or three primary doses at 2, 4, and 6 months followed \nby a booster dose at 15-18 months.

In the subgroup aged \n>65 years the percentage of vaccines with rSBA titres \u2265128 at 1 month post-vaccination ranged from \n90% (group A) to 97% (group Y). \n \nBooster response for subjects previously vaccinated with a conjugate meningococcal vaccine against \nNeisseria meningitidis \n \nNimenrix booster vaccination in subjects previously primed with a monovalent (MenC-CRM) or a \nquadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT) was studied in subjects from \n12 months of age onwards who received a booster vaccination. Robust anamnestic responses to the \nantigen(s) in the priming vaccine were observed (see Tables 6, 7, 11, 13, and 15). \n \nResponse to Nimenrix in subjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide vaccine against \nNeisseria meningitidis \n \nIn Study MenACWY-TT-021 conducted in subjects aged 4.5-34 years, the immunogenicity of \nNimenrix administered between 30 and 42 months after vaccination with a ACWY-PS vaccine was \ncompared to the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered to age-matched subjects who had not been \nvaccinated with any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years. An immune response (rSBA \ntitre \u22658) was observed against all four meningococcal groups in all subjects regardless of the \n\n\n\n24 \n\nmeningococcal vaccine history. The rSBA GMTs were significantly lower in the subjects who had \nreceived a dose of ACWY-PS vaccine 30-42 months prior to Nimenrix, however 100% of subjects \nachieved rSBA titres \u22658 for all four meningococcal groups (A, C, W-135, Y) (see section 4.4). \n \nChildren (2-17 years) with anatomical or functional asplenia \n \nStudy MenACWY-TT-084 compared immune responses to two doses of Nimenrix given 2 months \napart between 43 subjects aged 2-17 years with anatomic or functional asplenia subjects and \n43 age-matched subjects with normal splenic function. One month after the first vaccine dose and \n1 month after the second dose similar percentages of subjects in the two groups had rSBA titres \u22658 and \n\u2265128 and hSBA titres \u22654 and \u22658. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on local tolerance, acute toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, developmental/reproductive toxicity and fertility studies. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nThe powder or cake is white. \nThe solvent is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNimenrix is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 6 weeks against invasive \nmeningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135, and Y. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nNimenrix should be used in accordance with available official recommendations. \n \nPrimary immunisation \nInfants from 6 weeks to less than 6 months of age: two doses, each of 0.5 ml, should be administered \nwith an interval of 2 months between doses. \n \nInfants from 6 months of age, children, adolescents and adults: a single 0.5 mL dose should be \nadministered.  \nAn additional primary dose of Nimenrix may be considered appropriate for some individuals (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nBooster doses \nAfter completion of the primary immunisation course in infants 6 weeks to less than 12 months of age, \na booster dose should be given at 12 months of age with an interval of at least 2 months after the last \nNimenrix vaccination (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nIn previously vaccinated individuals 12 months of age and older, Nimenrix may be given as a booster \ndose if they have received primary vaccination with a conjugated or plain polysaccharide \nmeningococcal vaccine (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection only. \n \nIn infants, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In individuals from \n1 year of age, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid \nmuscle (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nNimenrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly, intradermally or \nsubcutaneously. \n \nIt is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with \nregard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical \nexamination. \n \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIntercurrent illness \n \nVaccination with Nimenrix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile \nillness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of \nvaccination. \n \nSyncope \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as \na psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological \nsigns such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during \nrecovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \n \nNimenrix should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nImmunodeficiency \n \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with \nimmunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nPersons with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons \nreceiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at \nincreased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, even \nif they develop antibodies following vaccination with Nimenrix. \n \nProtection against meningococcal disease \n \nNimenrix will only confer protection against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The \nvaccine will not protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. \n \nEffect of prior vaccination with plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine \nSubjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine and vaccinated \nwith Nimenrix 30 to 42 months later had lower Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) measured with a \nserum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA) than subjects who had not been vaccinated \nwith any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of \nthis observation is unknown. \n \nEffect of pre-vaccination antibody to tetanus toxoid \nThe safety and immunogenicity of Nimenrix was evaluated when it was sequentially administered or \nco-administered with a vaccine containing, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular pertussis, \ninactivated polioviruses (1, 2 and 3), hepatitis B surface antigen and Haemophilus influenzae type b \npolyribosyl ribose phosphate conjugated to tetanus toxoid (DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib) in the second year of \nlife. The administration of Nimenrix one month after the DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine resulted in \nlower rSBA GMTs against groups A, C and W-135 compared with co-administration (see section 4.5). \nThe clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. \n \nImmune response in infants aged 6 months to less than 12 months \nA single dose administered at 6 months was associated with lower human complement serum \nbactericidal assay (hSBA) titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with three doses administered at 2, \n4, and 6 months (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. If an infant \naged 6 months to less than 12 months is expected to be at particular risk of invasive meningococcal \ndisease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, consideration may be given to administering a \nsecond primary dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. \n \nImmune responses in toddlers aged 12-14 months \nToddlers aged 12-14 months had similar rSBA titres to groups A, C, W-135 and Y at one month after \none dose of Nimenrix or at one month after two doses of Nimenrix given two months apart. \n \nA single dose was associated with lower hSBA titres to groups W-135 and Y compared with two \ndoses given two months apart. Similar responses to groups A and C were observed after one or two \ndoses (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of the findings is unknown. If a toddler is expected to be \nat particular risk of invasive meningococcal disease due to exposure to groups W-135 and/or Y, \nconsideration may be given to administering a second dose of Nimenrix after an interval of 2 months. \nRegarding waning of antibody against group A or group C after a first dose of Nimenrix in children \naged 12-23 months, see under Persistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres. \n \nPersistence of serum bactericidal antibody titres \n \nFollowing administration of Nimenrix there is a waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against \ngroup A when using hSBA (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. \nHowever, if an individual is expected to be at particular risk of exposure to group A and received a \ndose of Nimenrix more than approximately one year previously, consideration may be given to \nadministering a booster dose. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nA decline in antibody titres over time has been observed for groups A, C, W-135 and Y. The clinical \nrelevance of this observation is unknown. A booster dose might be considered in individuals \nvaccinated at toddler age remaining at high risk of exposure to meningococcal disease caused by \ngroups A, C, W-135 or Y (see section 5.1). \n \nEffect of Nimenrix on anti-tetanus antibody concentrations \n \nAlthough an increase of the anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) antibody concentrations was observed following \nvaccination with Nimenrix, Nimenrix does not substitute for tetanus immunisation. \n \nGiving Nimenrix with or one month before a TT-containing vaccine in the second year of life does not \nimpair the response to TT or significantly affect safety. No data are available beyond the age of \n2 years. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIn infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines and \nwith 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nFrom age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: \nhepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, \nmeasles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or \nunadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. \n \nIn the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - \ntetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, \ninactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-\nIPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nIn individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus \nbivalent [Type 16 and 18] vaccine, recombinant (HPV2). \n \nWhenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, \nshould be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT \ncontaining vaccine. \n \nOne month after co-administration with a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, lower \nGeometric Mean antibody Concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) antibody \nGMTs were observed for one pneumococcal serotype (18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid carrier \nprotein). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. There was no impact of \nco-administration on immune responses to the other nine pneumococcal serotypes. \n \nOne month after co-administration with a combined tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and \nacellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap) in subjects aged 9 to 25 years, lower GMCs were \nobserved to each pertussis antigen (pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and \npertactin [PRN]). More than 98% of subjects had anti-PT, FHA or PRN concentrations above the \nassay cut-off thresholds. The clinical relevance of these observations is unknown. There was no \nimpact of co-administration on immune responses to Nimenrix or the tetanus or diphtheria antigens \nincluded in Tdap. \n \nIf Nimenrix is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always \nbe administered at different injection sites. \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, an adequate response may \nnot be elicited. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere is limited experience with use of Nimenrix in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, \nembryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). \n \nNimenrix should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed, and the possible advantages \noutweigh the potential risks for the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Nimenrix is excreted in human milk. \n \nNimenrix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the \npotential risks. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of Nimenrix on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \nHowever, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable effects\u201d may affect the ability \nto drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety of Nimenrix presented in the table below is based on two clinical study datasets as follows:  \n\n\uf0b7 A pooled analysis of data from 9,621 subjects administered a single dose of Nimenrix. This \ntotal included 3,079 toddlers (12 months to 23 months), 909 children between 2 and 5 years \nof age, 990 children between 6 and 10 years of age, 2,317 adolescents (11 to 17 years) and \n2,326 adults (18 to 55 years). \n\n\uf0b7 Data from a study in infants aged 6 to 12 weeks at the time of the first dose (Study \nMenACWY-TT-083), 1,052 subjects received at least one dose of a primary series of 2 or 3 \ndoses of Nimenrix and 1,008 received a booster dose at approximately 12 months of age. \n\n \nSafety data have also been evaluated in a separate study, in which a single dose of Nimenrix was \nadministered to 274 individuals aged 56 years and older. \n \nLocal and general adverse reactions \nIn the 6-12 weeks and in the 12-14 months age groups who received 2 doses of Nimenrix given \n2 months apart, the first and second doses were associated with similar local and systemic \nreactogenicity. \n \nThe local and general adverse reaction profile of a booster dose of Nimenrix given to subjects from \n12 months through 30 years of age after primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other conjugated or \nplain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines, was similar to the local and general adverse reaction \n\n\n\n32 \n\nprofile observed after primary vaccination with Nimenrix, except for gastrointestinal symptoms \n(including diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea), which were very common among subjects 6 years of age \nand older. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency categories: \n \nVery common: (\u22651/10) \nCommon: (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon: (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare:   (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare: (<1/10,000)  \nNot known (cannot be estimated from available data) \n \nTable 1 shows the adverse reactions reported from the studies in subjects aged from 6 weeks up to \n55 years of age and post-marketing experience. Adverse reactions reported in subjects aged >55 years \nwere similar to those observed in younger adults.  \n \nTable 1:  Tabulated summary of adverse reactions by system organ class \nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nVery common Appetite lost \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n \n\nVery common Irritability\nUncommon Insomnia \n\nCrying\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nVery common Drowsiness \nHeadache\n\nUncommon Hypoaesthesia \nDizziness\n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nCommon Diarrhoea \nVomiting \nNausea*\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Pruritus \nRash**\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Myalgia \nPain in extremity\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\nVery common Fever \nSwelling at injection site \nPain at injection site \nRedness at injection site \nFatigue\n\nCommon Injection site haematoma* \nUncommon Malaise \n\nInjection site induration \nInjection site pruritus \nInjection site warmth \nInjection site anaesthesia\n\n Not known*** Extensive limb swelling at the injection site, \nfrequently associated with erythema, \nsometimes involving the adjacent joint or \nswelling of the entire injected limb \n\n*Nausea and Injection site haematoma occurred at a frequency of Uncommon in infants \n**Rash occurred at a frequency of Common in infants \n***ADR identified post-marketing \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, meningococcal vaccines, ATC code: J07AH08 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAnti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal disease via complement \nmediated bactericidal activity. Nimenrix induces the production of bactericidal antibodies against \ncapsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y when measured by \nassays using either rSBA or hSBA. \n \nImmunogenicity in infants \n \nIn Study MenACWY-TT-083, the first dose was administered at 6 to 12 weeks of age, the second after \nan interval of 2 months, and a third (booster) dose administered at approximately 12 months of age. \nDTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib and a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine were co-administered. Nimenrix elicited \nrSBA and hSBA titres against the four meningococcal groups as shown in Table 2. The response \nagainst group C was non-inferior to the one elicited by licensed MenC-CRM and MenC-TT vaccines \nin terms of percentages with rSBA titres \u22658 at 1 month after the second dose.  \n \nData from this study support the extrapolation of the immunogenicity data and posology to infants \nfrom 12 weeks to less than 6 months of age. \n \nTable 2: rSBA and hSBA titres following two doses of Nimenrix (or MenC-CRM or MenC-TT) \n\ngiven 2 months apart with the first dose administered to  infants 6-12 weeks of age and \nfollowing a booster at 12 months of age (Study MenACWY-TT-083) \n\nMeningo-\ncoccal \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nTime \npoint \n\nrSBA* hSBA** \n\nN \n\uf0b38\uf020 GMT \n\nN \n\uf0b38\uf020 GMT \n\n(95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI) \n\nA Nimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 456 \n\n97.4% \n(95.4; 98.6)\n\n203 \n(182; 227) 202\n\n96.5%  \n(93.0; 98.6) \n\n157  \n(131; 188)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1)  462 \n\n99.6%  \n(98.4; 99.9)\n\n1561  \n(1412; 1725) 214\n\n99.5% \n(97.4;100) \n\n1007 \n(836;1214)\n\nC \n\nNimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 456 \n\n98.7%  \n(97.2; 99.5)\n\n612  \n(540; 693) 218\n\n98.6%  \n(96.0; 99.7) \n\n1308  \n(1052; 1627)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 463 \n\n99.8%  \n(98.8; 100)\n\n1177  \n(1059; 1308) 221\n\n99.5%  \n(97.5; 100) \n\n4992  \n(4086; 6100)\n\nMenC-\nCRM \n\nvaccine \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 455 \n\n99.6%  \n(98.4; 99.9)\n\n958  \n(850; 1079) 202\n\n100%  \n(98.2; 100) \n\n3188  \n(2646; 3841)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 446 \n\n98.4%  \n(96.8; 99.4)\n\n1051  \n(920; 1202) 216\n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n5438  \n(4412; 6702)\n\n\n\n34 \n\nTable 2: rSBA and hSBA titres following two doses of Nimenrix (or MenC-CRM or MenC-TT) \ngiven 2 months apart with the first dose administered to  infants 6-12 weeks of age and \nfollowing a booster at 12 months of age (Study MenACWY-TT-083) \n\nMeningo-\ncoccal \ngroup \n\nVaccine \ngroup \n\nTime \npoint \n\nrSBA* hSBA** \n\nN \n\uf0b38\uf020 GMT \n\nN \n\uf0b38\uf020 GMT \n\n(95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI) (95% CI) \n\nMenC-\nTT \n\nvaccine \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 457 \n\n100%  \n(99.2; 100)\n\n1188  \n(1080; 1307) 226\n\n100%  \n(98.4; 100) \n\n2626  \n(2219; 3109)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 459 \n\n100%  \n(99.2; 100)\n\n1960  \n(1776; 2163) 219\n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n5542  \n(4765; 6446)\n\nW Nimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 455 \n\n99.1%  \n(97.8; 99.8)\n\n1605  \n(1383; 1862) 217\n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n753 \n (644; 882)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 462 \n\n99.8%  \n(98.8; 100)\n\n2777  \n(2485; 3104) 218\n\n100%  \n(98.3; 100) \n\n5123  \n(4504; 5826)\n\nY Nimenrix \n\nPost-\ndose 2(1) 456 \n\n98.2%  \n(96.6; 99.2)\n\n483  \n(419; 558) 214\n\n97.7%  \n(94.6; 99.2) \n\n328  \n(276; 390)\n\nPost-\nbooster(1) 462 \n\n99.4%  \n(99.1; 99.9)\n\n881  \n(787; 986) 217\n\n100% \n(98.3; 100) \n\n2954  \n(2498; 3493)\n\nThe analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the primary according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort. \n*rSBA analysis performed at Public Health England (PHE) laboratories in UK \n**hSBA analysis performed at GSK laboratories \n(1) blood sampling performed 21 to 48 days post vaccination \n \nIn Study MenACWY-TT-087, infants received either a single primary dose at 6 months followed by a \nbooster dose at 15-18 months (DTaP-IPV/Hib and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was \nco-administered at both vaccination time points) or three primary doses at 2, 4, and 6 months followed \nby a booster dose at 15-18 months.

In the subgroup aged \n>65 years the percentage of vaccines with rSBA titres \u2265128 at 1 month post-vaccination ranged from \n90% (group A) to 97% (group Y). \n \nBooster response for subjects previously vaccinated with a conjugate meningococcal vaccine against \nNeisseria meningitidis \n \nNimenrix booster vaccination in subjects previously primed with a monovalent (MenC-CRM) or a \nquadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT) was studied in subjects from \n12 months of age onwards who received a booster vaccination. Robust anamnestic responses to the \nantigen(s) in the priming vaccine were observed (see Tables 6, 7, 11, 13, and 15). \n \nResponse to Nimenrix in subjects previously vaccinated with a plain polysaccharide vaccine against \nNeisseria meningitidis \n \nIn Study MenACWY-TT-021 conducted in subjects aged 4.5-34 years, the immunogenicity of \nNimenrix administered between 30 and 42 months after vaccination with a ACWY-PS vaccine was \ncompared to the immunogenicity of Nimenrix administered to age-matched subjects who had not been \nvaccinated with any meningococcal vaccine in the preceding 10 years. An immune response (rSBA \ntitre \u22658) was observed against all four meningococcal groups in all subjects regardless of the \n\n\n\n49 \n\nmeningococcal vaccine history. The rSBA GMTs were significantly lower in the subjects who had \nreceived a dose of ACWY-PS vaccine 30-42 months prior to Nimenrix, however 100% of subjects \nachieved rSBA titres \u22658 for all four meningococcal groups (A, C, W-135, Y) (see section 4.4). \n \nChildren (2-17 years) with anatomical or functional asplenia \n \nStudy MenACWY-TT-084 compared immune responses to two doses of Nimenrix given 2 months \napart between 43 subjects aged 2-17 years with anatomic or functional asplenia subjects and \n43 age-matched subjects with normal splenic function. One month after the first vaccine dose and \n1 month after the second dose similar percentages of subjects in the two groups had rSBA titres \u22658 and \n\u2265128 and hSBA titres \u22654 and \u22658. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on local tolerance, acute toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, developmental/reproductive toxicity and fertility studies. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n\uf0b7 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\uf0b7 This vaccine has been prescribed for you or your child. Do not pass it on to others. \n\uf0b7 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \nThis leaflet has been written assuming the person receiving the vaccine is reading it, but it can be \ngiven to adults and children so you may be reading it for your child. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet  \n1.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Nimenrix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Nimenrix is and what it is used for \nNimenrix is a vaccine which helps protect against infections caused by bacteria (germs) called \n\u201cNeisseria meningitidis\" types A, C, W-135 and Y. \n\u201cNeisseria meningitidis\" types A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as: \n\uf0b7 meningitis - an infection of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. \n\uf0b7 septicaemia - an infection of the blood. \nThese infections are passed easily from person to person and can cause death if not treated. \nNimenrix may be given to adults, adolescents, children and infants over the age of 6 weeks. \n \nHow Nimenrix works \nNimenrix helps your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. These \nantibodies help protect you against the diseases. \n \nNimenrix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria \u201cNeisseria meningitidis\u201d types A, \nC, W-135 and Y. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Nimenrix \n \nNimenrix should not be given if: \n\uf0b7 you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients in this vaccine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. See your doctor immediately if you notice any of these. \n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Nimenrix. \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you receive this vaccine if: \n\uf0b7 you have an infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to you, the \n\nvaccination will not be given until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor or nurse first. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive \nNimenrix. \n \nNimenrix may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated. If you have a weak immune system (such \nas due to HIV infection or medicines that affect the immune system) you may not get a full benefit \nfrom Nimenrix. \n \nFainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore \ntell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. \n \nOther medicines and Nimenrix \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including other \nvaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nNimenrix may not work as well if you are taking medicines that affect your immune system. \n \nIn infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular \npertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, inactivated \npoliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib \nvaccine, and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nFrom age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: \nhepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, \nmeasles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or \nunadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. \n \nIn the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - \ntetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, \ninactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-\nIPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nIn individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus \nvaccine [Types 16, 18] and a combined diphtheria (reduced antigen content), tetanus and acellular \npertussis vaccine. \n \nWhenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, \nshould be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT \ncontaining vaccine. \n \nA different injection site will be used for each vaccine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding, you \nmust tell your doctor before receiving Nimenrix. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNimenrix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any \nmachines if you are feeling unwell. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \nNimenrix contains sodium \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How Nimenrix is given \n \nNimenrix will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. \nNimenrix is always injected into a muscle, usually in the upper arm or thigh. \n \nPrimary immunisation \n \nInfants from 6 weeks to less than 6 months of age  \nTwo injections given 2 months apart at e.g. 2 and 4 months of age (the first injection may be given \nfrom the age of 6 weeks). \n \nInfants from 6 months of age, children, adolescents and adults \nOne injection. \n \nBooster doses \n \nInfants from 6 weeks to less than 12 months of age:  \nOne booster dose at 12 months of age, at least 2 months after the last dose of Nimenrix. \n \nPreviously vaccinated individuals 12 months of age and older:  \nPlease tell your doctor if you have received a previous injection with another meningococcal vaccine \nthan Nimenrix. \nYour doctor will tell you if and when you need an additional dose of Nimenrix, especially if you or \nyour child: \n\n\uf0b7 received your first dose at age 6-14 months and could be at particular risk of infection caused \nby Neisseria meningitidis types W-135 and Y \n\n\uf0b7 received your dose more than approximately one year ago and could be at risk of infection \ncaused by Neisseria meningitidis type A \n\n\uf0b7 received your first dose at age 12-23 months and could be at particular risk of infection caused \nby Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W-135 and Y \n \n\nYou will be informed when you or your child should come back for the next injection. If you or your \nchild misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you make another appointment. \n \nMake sure you or your child finishes the complete vaccination course. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Nimenrix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Nimenrix is and what it is used for \nNimenrix is a vaccine which helps protect against infections caused by bacteria (germs) called \n\u201cNeisseria meningitidis\u201d types A, C, W-135 and Y. \n\u201cNeisseria meningitidis\" types A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as: \n\uf0b7 meningitis - an infection of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. \n\uf0b7 septicaemia - an infection of the blood. \nThese infections are passed easily from person to person and can cause death if not treated. \nNimenrix may be given to adults, adolescents, children and infants over the age of 6 weeks. \n \nHow Nimenrix works \nNimenrix helps your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. These \nantibodies help protect you against the diseases. \nNimenrix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria \u201cNeisseria meningitidis\u201d types A, \nC, W-135 and Y. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Nimenrix \n \nNimenrix should not be given if: \n\uf0b7 you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients in this vaccine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. See your doctor immediately if you notice any of these. \n\nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Nimenrix. \n \n\n\n\n73 \n\nWarnings and precautions: \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you receive this vaccine if: \n\uf0b7 you have an infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to you, the \n\nvaccination will not be given until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold \nshould not be a problem. However, talk to your doctor or nurse first. \n\n\uf0b7 you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive \nNimenrix. \n \nNimenrix may not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated. If you have a weak immune system (such \nas due to HIV infection or medicines that affect the immune system) you may not get a full benefit \nfrom Nimenrix. \n \nFainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore \ntell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. \n \nOther medicines and Nimenrix \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including other \nvaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nNimenrix may not work as well if you are taking medicines that affect your immune system. \n \nIn infants, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular \npertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, inactivated \npoliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib \nvaccine, and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nFrom age 1 year and above, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: \nhepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, \nmeasles - mumps - rubella - varicella (MMRV) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or \nunadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. \n \nIn the second year of life, Nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - \ntetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B, \ninactivated poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type b (HBV, IPV or Hib) such as DTaP-HBV-\nIPV/Hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. \n \nIn individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus \nvaccine [Types 16, 18] and a combined diphtheria (reduced antigen content), tetanus and acellular \npertussis vaccine. \n \nWhenever possible, Nimenrix and a TT containing vaccine, such as DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, \nshould be co-administered or Nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the TT \ncontaining vaccine. \n \nA different injection site will be used for each vaccine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding, you \nmust tell your doctor before receiving Nimenrix. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNimenrix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any \nmachines if you are feeling unwell. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nNimenrix contains sodium \nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How Nimenrix is given \n \nNimenrix will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. \nNimenrix is always injected into a muscle, usually in the upper arm or thigh. \n \nPrimary immunisation \n \nInfants from 6 weeks to less than 6 months of age  \nTwo injections given 2 months apart at e.g. 2 and 4 months of age (the first injection may be given \nfrom the age of 6 weeks). \n \nInfants from 6 months of age, children, adolescents and adults \nOne injection.  \n \nBooster doses \n \nInfants from 6 weeks to less than 12 months of age:  \nOne booster dose at 12 months of age, at least 2 months after the last dose of Nimenrix. \n \nPreviously vaccinated individuals 12 months of age and older:  \nPlease tell your doctor if you have received a previous injection with another meningococcal vaccine \nthan Nimenrix. Your doctor will tell you if and when you need an additional dose of Nimenrix, \nespecially if you or your child:  \n\n\uf0b7 received your first dose at age 6-14 months and could be at particular risk of infection caused \nby Neisseria meningitidis types W-135 and Y \n\n\uf0b7 received your dose more than approximately one year ago and could be at risk of infection \ncaused by Neisseria meningitidis type A \n\n\uf0b7 received your first dose at age 12-23 months and could be at particular risk of infection caused \nby Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W-135 and Y \n\n \nYou will be informed when you or your child should come back for the next injection. If you or your \nchild misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you make another appointment. \nMake sure you or your child finishes the complete vaccination course. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

infections caused by bacteria (germs) called \"neisseria meningitidis\" types a, c, w-135 and y. \"neisseria meningitidis\" types a, c, w-135 and y bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as: meningitis - an infection of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. septicaemia - an infection of the blood. these infections are passed easily from person to person and can cause death if not treated. nimenrix may be given to adults, adolescents, children and infants over the age of 6 weeks. how nimenrix works nimenrix helps your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria. these antibodies help protect you against the diseases. nimenrix will only protect against infections caused by the bacteria \"neisseria meningitidis\" types a, c, w-135 and y.",

injection. therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. other medicines and nimenrix tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including other vaccines and medicines obtained without a prescription. nimenrix may not work as well if you are taking medicines that affect your immune system. in infants, nimenrix can be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis (dtap) vaccines, including combination dtap vaccines with hepatitis b, inactivated poliovirus or haemophilus influenzae type b (hbv, ipv or hib) such as dtap-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine, and with 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. from age 1 year and above, nimenrix can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: hepatitis a (hav) and hepatitis b (hbv) vaccines, measles - mumps - rubella (mmr) vaccine, measles - mumps - rubella - varicella (mmrv) vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or unadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. in the second year of life, nimenrix can also be given concomitantly with combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis (dtap) vaccines, including combination dtap vaccines with hepatitis b, inactivated poliovirus or haemophilus influenzae type b (hbv, ipv or hib) such as dtap-hbv- ipv/hib vaccine, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. in individuals aged 9 to 25 years, nimenrix can be given concomitantly with human papillomavirus vaccine [types 16, 18] and a combined diphtheria (reduced antigen content), tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine. whenever possible, nimenrix and a tt containing vaccine, such as dtap-hbv-ipv/hib vaccine, should be co-administered or nimenrix should be administered at least one month before the tt containing vaccine. a different injection site will be used for each vaccine. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant
