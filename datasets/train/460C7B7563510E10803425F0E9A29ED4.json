NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nelmiron 100 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 100 mg of pentosan polysulfate sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \nWhite opaque capsules size 2. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nelmiron is indicated for the treatment of bladder pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations \nor Hunner\u2019s lesions in adults with moderate to severe pain, urgency and frequency of micturition (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults  \nThe recommended dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium is 300 mg/day taken as one 100 mg capsule \norally three times daily.  \nResponse to treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium should be reassessed every 6 months. In case \nno improvement is reached 6 months after treatment initiation, treatment with pentosan polysulfate \nsodium should be stopped. In responders pentosan polysulfate sodium treatment should be continued \nchronically as long as the response is maintained. \n \nSpecial populations \nPentosan polysulfate sodium has not been specifically studied in special patient populations like \nelderly or patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). No dose adjustment is \nrecommended for these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of pentosan polysulfate sodium in children and adolescent below 18 years has \nnot been established. \nNo data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nThe capsules should be taken with water at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDue to the weak anticoagulant effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium, elmiron must not be used in \npatients who actively bleed. Menstruation is no contraindication. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBladder pain syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and other urologic disorders should be eliminated \nby the prescriber, such as urinary tract infection or bladder cancer. \n \nPentosan polysulfate sodium is a weak anticoagulant. Patients undergoing invasive procedures or \nhaving signs/symptoms of underlying coagulopathy or other increased risk of bleeding (due to \ntreatment with other medicinal products influencing coagulation such as anticoagulants, heparin \nderivatives, thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents including acetylsalicylic acid, or nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory medicinal products (see section 4.5)) should be evaluated for haemorrhagic events. \nPatients who have a history of heparin or pentosan polysulfate sodium induced thrombocytopenia \nshould be carefully monitored when treated with pentosan polysulfate sodium. \n \nHepatic or renal insufficiency \nelmiron has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. Because there is evidence \nof hepatic and renal contribution to the elimination of pentosan polysulfate sodium, hepatic or renal \nimpairment may have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of pentosan polysulfate sodium. Patients \nwith relevant hepatic or renal insufficiency should be carefully monitored when treated with pentosan \npolysulfate sodium. \n \nRare cases of pigmentary maculopathy have been reported with use of pentosan polysulfate sodium \n(PPS), especially after long term use. Visual symptoms might include complaints of difficulty when \nreading, visual distortions, altered colour vision and/or slow adjustment to low or reduced light \nenvironments.  \nAll patients should have an ophthalmologic examination after 6 months of use of PPS for early \ndetection of pigmentary maculopathy, and, if there are no pathologic findings, regularly after 5 years \nof use (or earlier, in case of visual complaints). However, in case of relevant ophthalmologic findings, \na yearly examination should be conducted. In such situations, treatment cessation should be \nconsidered. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nA study in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between \ntherapeutic doses of warfarin and pentosan polysulfate sodium. No further interaction studies have \nbeen performed. \n \nDue to the weak anticoagulant effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium, patients, who are concomitantly \ntreated with anticoagulants, heparin derivatives, thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents including \nacetylsalicylic acid, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products should be evaluated for any \nhaemorrhagic event in order to adapt the dose if needed (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of pentosan polysulfate sodium in pregnant women. Animal studies \nwith respect to reproductive toxicity were not conducted.   \n \nelmiron is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether pentosan polysulfate sodium or metabolites are excreted in human milk. \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nTherefore, pentosan polysulfate sodium should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nNo information on a potential impact of pentosan polysulfate sodium on fertility is available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPentosan polysulfate sodium has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe following section lists adverse events reported in the literature from clinical studies with pentosan \npolysulfate sodium. The potential relatedness between these adverse events and the treatment with \npentosan polysulfate sodium was not discussed in the respective publications. \n \nThe most common adverse events reported from the clinical studies are headache, dizziness and \ngastro-intestinal events like diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.  \n \nThe adverse events reported under treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium were comparable to \nthose reported under treatment with placebo in regards to quality and quantity. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse events \nAdverse events are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Very \ncommon (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data).  \n \nInfections and infestations Common Infections, influenza  \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon \nAnaemia, ecchymosis, haemorrhage, \nleukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNot known Coagulation disorders \n\nImmune system disorder \nUncommon Photosensitivity \nNot known Allergic reactions \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Anorexia, weight gain, weight loss \n\nPsychiatric disorders Uncommon Severe Emotional Lability/Depression  \n\nNervous system disorders \nCommon Headache, dizziness  \n\nUncommon Increased sweating, insomnia, hyperkinesia, \nparaesthesia \n\nEye disorders Uncommon Lacrimation, amblyopia  \nEar disorders Uncommon Tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon \n\nNausea, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal \npain, abdomen enlarged, rectal haemorrhage \n\nUncommon Indigestion, vomiting, mouth ulcer, \nflatulence, constipation \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Peripheral oedema, alopecia  \nUncommon Rash, increased mole size  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Back pain \nUncommon Myalgia, Arthralgia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Urinary frequency \n\n\n\n5 \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nCommon Asthenia, pelvic pain \n\nInvestigation Not known Liver function abnormalities \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the case of an accidental overdose, patients should be evaluated for potential adverse effects of \npentosan polysulfate sodium like gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding. In case of adverse reactions, \ntreatment might be paused until the symptoms abate and treatment should be continued at the \nrecommended dose after a critical balancing of the risks thereafter. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, other urologicals, ATC code: G04BX15. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe hypothetic mechanism of action of pentosan polysulfate sodium includes a local effect in the \nbladder after systemic administration and excretion into the urine by binding of glycosaminoglycans to \nthe deficient mucous of the bladder. This binding of glycosaminoglycans to the bladder mucous \nreduces bacterial adherence to the inner surface of the bladder and in consequence the incidence of \ninfections is reduced as well. It is hypothesized, that a potential barrier function of pentosan \npolysulfate sodium instead of the damaged urothelial mucus might play a role as well the anti-\ninflammatory activity of pentosan polysulfate sodium. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nA total of four randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical studies prospectively enrolling \npatients with bladder pain syndrome diagnosed via cystoscopic examination with or without bladder \nhydrodistension evaluating the efficacy of oral treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium were \npublished in scientific literature. In all of these studies, patients reported a better subjective \nimprovement of bladder pain syndrome under treatment with pentosan polysulfate sodium compared \nto placebo. In three studies, the observed difference was clearly statistically significant.  \nThe first study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with a planned cross-over \ndesign evaluating pentosan polysulfate sodium versus placebo. Depending on which institution the \npatients attended they were treated with either 3x100 mg or 2x200 mg PPS per day. 75 patients were \nrandomised into the study and 62 of those completed the study. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated \nbased on the patient reported improvement on four typical symptoms of bladder pain syndrome: pain, \nurgency, frequency, and nocturia, no primary endpoint was defined. A patient was counted as a \nresponder to treatment in case a 50% improvement compared to baseline was reported for a specific \nsymptom after 3 months of treatment. An evaluation of all data generated in the study showed that for \nall four symptoms statistically significant more patients responded to pentosan polysulfate sodium \ntreatment compared to placebo: \n PPS Placebo P-value \nPain    \n\nNo. responders / total (%) 19/42 (45) 7/38 (18) 0.02 \nAv. % improvement* 33.0 \u00b1 35 15.8 \u00b1 26 0.01 \n\nUrgency    \nNo. responders / total (%) 21/42 (50) 9/48 (19) 0.03 \nAv. % improvement* 27.6 \u00b1 31 14.0 \u00b1 24 0.01 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nFrequency    \nNo. responders / total (%) 33/52 (63) 16/41 (39) 0.005 \nAv. improvement -5.1 -0.4 0.002 \n\nNocturia    \nAv. improvement* -1.5 \u00b1 2.9 -0.5 \u00b1 0.5 0.04 \n\n(*Mean \u00b1 SD) \n \nThe following two studies were conducted following very comparable double-blind, randomized, \nplacebo-controlled multicentre study designs. The patients in both studies were treated for three \nmonths with either 3x100 mg pentosan polysulfate sodium or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint \nof the study was the overall improvement as self-reported by the patient after three months of \ntreatment. The patients were asked whether they felt improved overall since the start of treatment, and \nif so, whether the improvement was \u201cslight\u201d 25%, \u201cmoderate \u201c50%, \u201cgreat\u201d 75% or \u201ccomplete cure\u201d \n100%. Patients who reported at least moderate (50%) improvement were counted as responders. The \nsecondary efficacy endpoints included the investigators evaluation of improvement. The used scale for \nthe investigators assessment included the categories \u201cworse\u201d, \u201cno change\u201d, \u201cfair\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cvery \ngood\u201d, and \u201cexcellent\u201d. A responder was defined as a patient assessed to be at least \u201cgood\u201d compared \nto baseline. Furthermore volume voiding profiles over three days and the impact of treatment on pain \nand urgency were evaluated as secondary endpoints. The impact on pain and urgency was evaluated \nvia the same questionnaire as the primary endpoint with a responder defined as a patient experiencing \nan at least moderate (50%) improvement compared to baseline. In addition the impact on pain and \nurgency was evaluated via a 5 score scale, where a responder was defined as a patient experiencing at \nleast a 1-point improvement compared to baseline. \n110 patients were enrolled and treated for three months in the first of the two very comparable studies. \nA statistically significant benefit of pentosan polysulfate sodium over placebo was demonstrated over \nthe primary endpoint, the patients overall-assessment of improvement as well as on the investigators \noverall assessment. Furthermore a trend for better efficacy of pentosan polysulfate sodium was \nobserved for the patients self-assessment of an improvement of pain and urgency, despite a deviating \neffect observed for the evaluation of urgency via the scale. In addition positive effects were observed \non the voiding profile, although the observed differences were not statistically significant: \n PPS Placebo P-value \nResponders based on patients self-evaluation of \noverall improvement \n\n \n28% \n\n \n13% \n\n \n0.04 \n\nResponders based on investigators evaluation of \noverall improvement \n\n \n26% \n\n \n11% \n\n \n0.03 \n\nResponders regarding pain and urgency    \nPain (moderate/50% improvement) 27% 14% 0.08 \nPain scale (1-point improvement) 46% 29% 0.07 \nPressure to urinate (moderate/50% improvement) 22% 11% 0.08 \nUrgency scale (1-point improvement) 39% 46% ns \n\nMean reduction in pain score from baseline 0.5 0.2 ns \nChanges from baseline voiding characteristics    \n\nMean volume per void (cc) 9.8 7.6 ns \nIncrease of \u2265 20 cc (% pts) 30 20 ns \nTotal daily urine volume (cc) +60 -20 ns \nVoids per day -1 -1 ns \n3 voids less per day (% pts) 32 24 ns \nNocturia -0.8 -0.5 ns \n\n \nThe second of the two very comparable studies enrolled 148 patients and demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant benefit pentosan polysulfate sodium over placebo was demonstrated on the patient reported \noverall improvement evaluated as primary endpoint and an the investigator-assessed overall \nimprovement, all evaluations on pain and urgency.

Patients were randomized to \nfour treatment group and were treated for six months with 3x100 mg pentosan polysulfate sodium, \n1x50 mg hydroxyzine, both active treatments, or placebo. A responder analysis based on a patient-\nreported Global Response Assessment (GRA) after 24 weeks of treatment was defined as primary \nendpoint. The GRA assessment was evaluated via a 7-point centred scale, in which the patients can \nassess their global response compared to baseline as markedly worse, moderately worse, slightly \nworse, no change, slightly improved, moderately improved or markedly improved. Participants who \nreported either of the latter two categories were defined as treatment responders. Secondary outcome \nmeasures included the O\u2019Leary-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index, the University of Wisconsin \nSymptom score, patient reported symptoms of pain/discomfort and urgency, and results of a 24-hour \nvoiding diary. Comparison of those patients receiving pentosan polysulfate sodium with those not \nreceiving pentosan polysulfate sodium (irrespective of treatment with oral hydroxyzine) revealed no \nstatistically significant difference between the two group, but a trend for better efficacy was observed \nfor the primary endpoint in those patients treated with pentosan polysulfate sodium (either alone or in \ncombination with hydroxyzine) (20 of 59, 34%) compared to the those patients not receiving pentosan \npolysulfate sodium, but who might receive hydroxyzine (11 of 62, 18%, p0.064): \n PPS Placebo  \nNo. randomized 59 62  \nNo. responders (%) 20 (34) 11 (18)  \nNo. complete secondary end point data (%) 49 (83) 47 (76) \n\nMean pain score \u00b1 SD (0-9) -1.2 \u00b1 1.9 -0.7 \u00b1 1.8  \nMean urgency score \u00b1 SD (0-9) -1.2\u00b11.6 -0.9 \u00b1 1.6  \nMean 24-hr frequency \u00b1 SD -0.7 \u00b1 4.8 -0.9 \u00b1 6.3  \nMean IC symptom index \u00b1 SD (0-20) -2.6 \u00b1 3.4 -1.7 \u00b1 3.5  \nMean IC problem index \u00b1 SD (0-16) -2.6 \u00b1 3.5 -1.9 \u00b1 2.8  \nMean Wisconsin IC score \u00b1 SD (0-42) -6.2 \u00b1 8.9 -6.7 \u00b1 8.2  \n\n \nA pooled analysis of the data described above from placebo-controlled clinical studies was conducted \nto evaluate, whether patients taking oral pentosan polysulfate sodium have clear benefit from the \ntreatment. This pooled analysis showed that the percentage of patients responding to treatment with \npentosan polysulfate sodium with a clinically relevant improvement in their overall assessment, pain \nand urgency was approximately 2-fold higher than the respective responder rates under placebo:   \n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n PPS  Placebo \nGRA \n(95% CI) \n\n33,0% \n(27.1% - 39.4%) \n\n15.8% \n(11.6% - 21.2%) \n\nPain \n(95% CI) \n\n32.7% \n(26.0% - 40.3%) \n\n14.2% \n(9.6% - 20.6%) \n\nUrgency \n(95% CI) \n\n27.4% \n(21.1% - 34.8%) \n\n14.2% \n(9.6% - 20.6%) \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nLess than 10% of orally administered pentosan polysulfate sodium are slowly absorbed from the \ngastrointestinal tract and are available in systemic circulation in the form of unchanged pentosan \npolysulfate sodium or it\u2019s metabolites. All studies describe very low systemic availability of \nunchanged pentosan polysulfate sodium after oral administration. Overall, the reported systemic \nbioavailability after oral administration of pentosan polysulfate sodium is below 1%. \n \nDistribution \nIn healthy volunteers, a single parenteral administration of radioactively labelled pentosan polysulfate \nsodium leads to a progressive up-take of total radioactivity by the liver, spleen, and kidney (50 min \nafter 1 mg/kg i.v.: 60 % of the dose in the liver, 7.7 % in the spleen; 3 h post dosing: 60 % in the liver \nplus spleen, and 13 % in the bladder). \n \nBiotransformation \nPentosan polysulfate sodium is metabolised extensively by desulfation in liver and spleen and \ndepolymerisation in the kidney. \n \nElimination \nThe apparent plasma half-life of pentosan polysulfate sodium depends on the route of administration. \nWhile pentosan polysulfate sodium is rapidly cleared from circulation of i.v. administration, the \napparent plasma half-life after oral administration is in the range of 24-34 hours. Accordingly, oral \nadministration of pentosan polysulfate sodium 3-times daily is expected to lead to accumulation of \npentosan polysulfate sodium over the first 7 days of administration (accumulation factor 5-6.7). \nAfter oral administration unabsorbed pentosan polysulfate sodium is excreted predominantly \nunchanged in the faeces. About 6% of the administered dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium were \nexcreted via urine after desulfation and depolymerisation. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional repeated dose toxicity, \ngenotoxicity and long-term carcinogenicity studies. \nThe effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium on reproductive and developmental toxicity has not been \ninvestigated. \n \n \n6.
