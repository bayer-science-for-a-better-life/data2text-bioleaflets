NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nXagrid 0.5 mg hard capsules. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach hard capsule contains 0.5 mg anagrelide (as anagrelide hydrochloride). \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect \n\nEach hard capsule contains lactose monohydrate (53.7 mg) and anhydrous lactose (65.8 mg). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\n \n\nAn opaque white hard capsule imprinted with S 063. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nXagrid is indicated for the reduction of elevated platelet counts in at risk essential thrombocythaemia \n\n(ET) patients who are intolerant to their current therapy or whose elevated platelet counts are not \n\nreduced to an acceptable level by their current therapy. \n\n \n\nAn at-risk patient \n\nAn at-risk essential thrombocythaemia patient is defined by one or more of the following features: \n\n• >60 years of age or \n\n• a platelet count >1000 x 109/l or \n\n• a history of thrombo-haemorrhagic events. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment with Xagrid should be initiated by a clinician with experience in the management of \n\nessential thrombocythaemia. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended starting dose of anagrelide is 1 mg/day, which should be administered orally in two \n\ndivided doses (0.5 mg/dose). \n\n \n\nThe starting dose should be maintained for at least one week. After one week the dose may be titrated, \n\non an individual basis, to achieve the lowest effective dose required to reduce and/or maintain a \n\nplatelet count below 600 x 109/l and ideally at levels between 150 x 109/l and 400 x 109/l. The dose \n\nincrement must not exceed more than 0.5 mg/day in any one week and the recommended maximum \n\nsingle dose should not exceed 2.5 mg (see section 4.9). During clinical development, doses of \n\n10 mg/day have been used. \n\n \n\nThe effects of treatment with anagrelide must be monitored on a regular basis (see section 4.4). If the \n\nstarting dose is > 1 mg/day, platelet counts should be performed every two days during the first week \n\nof treatment and at least weekly thereafter until a stable maintenance dose is reached. Typically, a fall \n\nin the platelet count will be observed within 14 to 21 days of starting treatment and in most patients an \n\n\n\n3 \n\nadequate therapeutic response will be observed and maintained at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/day (for further \n\ninformation on the clinical effects, refer to section 5.1). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nThe observed pharmacokinetic differences between elderly and young patients with ET (see section \n\n5.2) do not warrant using a different starting regimen or different dose titration step to achieve an \n\nindividual patient-optimised anagrelide regimen. \n\n \n\nDuring clinical development, approximately 50% of the patients treated with anagrelide were over \n\n60 years of age and no age specific alterations in dose were required in these patients. However, as \n\nexpected, patients in this age group had twice the incidence of serious adverse events (mainly cardiac). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data for this patient population. The potential risks and benefits of \n\nanagrelide therapy in a patient with impairment of renal function should be assessed before treatment \n\nis commenced (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data for this patient population. However, hepatic metabolism \n\nrepresents the major route of anagrelide clearance and liver function may therefore be expected to \n\ninfluence this process. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with moderate or severe hepatic \n\nimpairment are not treated with anagrelide. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a \n\npatient with mild impairment of hepatic function should be assessed before treatment is commenced \n\n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of anagrelide in children have not been established. The experience in children \n\nand adolescents is very limited; anagrelide should be used in this patient group with caution. In the \n\nabsence of specific paediatric guidelines, WHO diagnostic criteria for adult diagnosis of ET are \n\nconsidered to be of relevance to the paediatric population. Diagnostic guidelines for essential \n\nthrombocythemia should be followed carefully and diagnosis reassessed periodically in cases of \n\nuncertainty, with effort made to distinguish from hereditary or secondary thrombocytosis, which may \n\ninclude genetic analysis and bone marrow biopsy. \n\n \n\nTypically, cytoreductive therapy is considered in high-risk paediatric patients. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide treatment should only be initiated when the patient shows signs of disease progression or \n\nsuffers from thrombosis. If treatment is initiated, the benefits and risks of treatment with anagrelide \n\nmust be monitored regularly and the need for ongoing treatment evaluated periodically. \n\n \n\nPlatelet targets are assigned on an individual patient basis by the treating physician. \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of treatment should be considered in paediatric patients who do not have a satisfactory \n\ntreatment response after approximately 3 months. \n\n \n\nCurrently available data are described in sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a \n\nposology can be made. \n\n \n\nMethod of Administration \n\nFor oral use. The capsules must be swallowed whole. Do not crush or dilute the contents in a liquid. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to anagrelide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nPatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \n\nPatients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 ml/min). \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild impairment of hepatic \n\nfunction should be assessed before treatment is commenced. It is not recommended in patients with \n\nelevated transaminases (>5 times the upper limit of normal) (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nThe potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with impairment of renal function \n\nshould be assessed before treatment is commenced (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\nMonitoring \n\nTherapy requires close clinical supervision of the patient which will include a full blood count \n\n(haemoglobin and white blood cell and platelet counts), assessment of liver function (ALT and AST), \n\nrenal function (serum creatinine and urea) and electrolytes (potassium, magnesium and calcium). \n\n \n\nPlatelets \n\nThe platelet count will increase within 4 days of stopping treatment with anagrelide and will return to \n\npre-treatment levels within 10 to 14 days, possibly rebounding above baseline values. Therefore, \n\nplatelets should be monitored frequently. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular \n\nSerious cardiovascular adverse events including cases of torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, \n\ncardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure have been reported (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nCaution should be taken when using anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, \n\nmedicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalaemia. \n\n \n\nCare should also be taken in populations that may have a higher maximum plasma concentration \n\n(Cmax) of anagrelide or its active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, e.g., hepatic impairment or use \n\nwith CYP1A2 inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nClose monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. \n\n \n\nA pre-treatment cardiovascular examination, including a baseline ECG and echocardiography is \n\nrecommended for all patients prior to initiating therapy with anagrelide. All patients should be \n\nmonitored regularly during treatment (e.g., ECG or echocardiography) for evidence of cardiovascular \n\neffects that may require further cardiovascular examination and investigation. Hypokalaemia or \n\nhypomagnesaemia must be corrected prior to anagrelide administration and should be monitored \n\nperiodically during therapy. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III and because of its positive inotropic \n\nand chronotropic effects, anagrelide should be used with caution in patients of any age with known or \n\nsuspected heart disease. Moreover, serious cardiovascular adverse events have also occurred in \n\npatients without suspected heart disease and with normal pre-treatment cardiovascular examination. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide should only be used if the potential benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks. \n\n \n\nPulmonary hypertension \n\nCases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Patients \n\nshould be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating \n\nand during anagrelide therapy. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nVery limited data are available on the use of anagrelide in the paediatric population and anagrelide \n\nshould be used in this patient group with caution (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nAs with the adult population, a full blood count and assessment of cardiac, hepatic and renal function \n\nshould be undertaken before treatment and regularly during treatment. The disease may progress to \n\nmyelofibrosis or AML. Although the rate of such progression is not known, children have a longer \n\ndisease course and may, therefore, be at increased risk for malignant transformation, relative to adults. \n\nChildren should be monitored regularly for disease progression according to standard clinical \n\npractices, such as physical examination, assessment of relevant disease markers and bone marrow \n\nbiopsy. \n\n \n\nAny abnormalities should be evaluated promptly and appropriate measures taken, which may also \n\ninclude dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation. \n\n \n\nClinically relevant interactions \n\nAnagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III (PDE III). Concomitant use of \n\nanagrelide with other PDE III inhibitors such as milrinone, amrinone, enoximone, olprinone and \n\ncilostazol is not recommended. \n\n \n\nUse of concomitant anagrelide and acetylsalicylic acid has been associated with major haemorrhagic \n\nevents (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nXagrid contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nLimited pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic studies investigating possible interactions between \n\nanagrelide and other medicinal products have been conducted. \n\n \n\nEffects of other active substances on anagrelide \n\n• In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that digoxin and warfarin do not affect \n\nthe pharmacokinetic properties of anagrelide. \n\nCYP1A2 inhibitors \n\n• Anagrelide is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2. It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by \n\nseveral medicinal products, including fluvoxamine and enoxacin, and such medicinal products \n\ncould theoretically adversely influence the clearance of anagrelide. \n\nCYP1A2 inducers \n\n• CYP1A2 inducers (such as omeprazole) could decrease the exposure of anagrelide (see \n\nsection 5.2). The consequences on the safety and efficacy profile of anagrelide are not established. \n\nTherefore, clinical and biological monitoring is recommended in patients taking concomitant \n\nCYP1A2 inducers. If needed, anagrelide dose adjustment could be made. \n\n \n\nEffects of anagrelide on other active substances \n\n• Anagrelide demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a \n\ntheoretical potential for interaction with other co-administered medicinal products sharing that \n\nclearance mechanism e.g., theophylline. \n\n• Anagrelide is an inhibitor of PDE III. The effects of medicinal products with similar properties \n\nsuch as the inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be \n\nexacerbated by anagrelide. \n\n• In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that anagrelide does not affect the \n\npharmacokinetic properties of digoxin or warfarin. \n\n• At the doses recommended for use in the treatment of essential thrombocythaemia, anagrelide \n\nmay potentiate the effects of other medicinal products that inhibit or modify platelet function \n\ne.g., acetylsalicylic acid. \n\n• A clinical interaction study performed in healthy subjects showed that co-administration of \n\nrepeat-dose anagrelide 1 mg once daily and acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily may enhance \n\nthe anti-platelet aggregation effects of each active substance compared with administration of \n\n\n\n6 \n\nacetylsalicylic acid alone. In some patients with ET concomitantly treated by acetylsalicylic acid \n\nand anagrelide, major haemorrhages occurred. Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant \n\nuse of anagrelide with acetylsalicylic acid should be assessed, particularly in patients with a \n\nhigh-risk profile for haemorrhage before treatment is initiated. \n\n• Anagrelide may cause intestinal disturbance in some patients and compromise the absorption of \n\nhormonal oral contraceptives. \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\n• Food delays the absorption of anagrelide, but does not significantly alter systemic exposure. \n\n• The effects of food on bioavailability are not considered clinically relevant to the use of \n\nanagrelide. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential \n\nWomen of child-bearing potential should use adequate birth-control measures during treatment with \n\nanagrelide. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of anagrelide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \n\nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, \n\nXagrid is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nIf anagrelide is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using the medicinal \n\nproduct, she should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether anagrelide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in animals \n\nhave shown excretion of anagrelide/metabolites in milk. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be \n\nexcluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with anagrelide. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo human data on the effect of anagrelide on fertility are available. In male rats, there was no effect \n\non fertility or reproductive performance with anagrelide. In female rats, using doses in excess of the \n\ntherapeutic range, anagrelide disrupted implantation (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nIn clinical development, dizziness was commonly reported. Patients are advised not to drive or operate \n\nmachinery while taking anagrelide if dizziness is experienced. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of anagrelide has been examined in 4 open label clinical studies. In 3 of the studies 942 \n\npatients who received anagrelide at a mean dose of approximately 2 mg/day were assessed for safety. \n\nIn these studies, 22 patients received anagrelide for up to 4 years. \n\n \n\nIn the later study 3660 patients who received anagrelide at a mean dose of approximately 2 mg/day \n\nwere assessed for safety. In this study 34 patients received anagrelide for up to 5 years. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with anagrelide were headache occurring at \n\napproximately 14%, palpitations occurring at approximately 9%, fluid retention and nausea both \n\noccurring at approximately 6% and diarrhoea occurring at 5%. These adverse drug reactions are \n\n\n\n7 \n\nexpected based on the pharmacology of anagrelide (inhibition of PDE III).

However, safety data \n\nare limited and do not allow a meaningful comparison between adult and paediatric patients to be \n\nmade (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nPost-marketing case reports of intentional overdose with anagrelide have been received. Reported \n\nsymptoms include sinus tachycardia and vomiting. Symptoms resolved with conservative \n\nmanagement. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide, at higher than recommended doses, has been shown to produce reductions in blood \n\npressure with occasional instances of hypotension. A single 5-mg dose of anagrelide can lead to a fall \n\nin blood pressure usually accompanied by dizziness. \n\n \n\nA specific antidote for anagrelide has not been identified. In case of overdose, close clinical \n\nsupervision of the patient is required; this includes monitoring of the platelet count for \n\nthrombocytopenia. Dose should be decreased or stopped, as appropriate, until the platelet count returns \n\nto within the normal range. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC Code: L01XX35. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThe precise mechanism by which anagrelide reduces blood platelet count is unknown. In cell culture \n\nstudies, anagrelide suppressed expression of transcription factors including GATA-1 and FOG-1 \n\nrequired for megakaryocytopoiesis, ultimately leading to reduced platelet production. \n\n \n\nIn vitro studies of human megakaryocytopoiesis established that anagrelide’s inhibitory actions on \n\nplatelet formation in man are mediated via retardation of maturation of megakaryocytes, and reducing \n\ntheir size and ploidy. Evidence of similar in vivo actions was observed in bone marrow biopsy samples \n\nfrom treated patients. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe safety and efficacy of anagrelide as a platelet lowering agent have been evaluated in four open-\n\nlabel, non-controlled clinical trials (study numbers 700-012, 700-014, 700-999 and 13970-301) \n\nincluding more than 4000 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In patients with \n\nessential thrombocythaemia complete response was defined as a decrease in platelet count to 600 x \n\n109/l or a 50% reduction from baseline and maintenance of the reduction for at least 4 weeks. In \n\nstudies 700-012, 700-014, 700-999 and study 13970-301 the time to complete response ranged from 4 \n\nto 12 weeks. Clinical benefit in terms of thrombohaemorrhagic events has not been convincingly \n\ndemonstrated. \n\n \n\nEffects on heart rate and QTc interval \n\nThe effect of two dose levels of anagrelide (0.5 mg and 2.5 mg single doses) on the heart rate and QTc \n\ninterval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, cross-over study \n\nin healthy adult men and women. \n\n \n\nA dose-related increase in heart rate was observed during the first 12 hours, with the maximum \n\nincrease occurring around the time of maximal concentrations. The maximum change in mean heart \n\nrate occurred at 2 hours after administration and was +7.8 beats per minute (bpm) for 0.5 mg and \n\n+29.1 bpm for 2.5 mg. \n\n \n\nA transient increase in mean QTc was observed for both doses during periods of increasing heart rate \n\nand the maximum change in mean QTcF (Fridericia correction) was +5.0 msec occurring at 2 hours \n\nfor 0.5 mg and +10.0 msec occurring at 1 hour for 2.5 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn an open-label clinical study in 8 children and 10 adolescents (including patients who were \n\nanagrelide treatment naïve or who had been receiving anagrelide for up to 5 years pre-study), median \n\nplatelet counts were decreased to controlled levels after 12 weeks of treatment. The average daily dose \n\ntended to be higher in adolescents. \n\n \n\nIn a paediatric registry study, median platelet counts were reduced from diagnosis and maintained for \n\nup to 18 months in 14 paediatric patients with ET (4 children, 10 adolescents) with anagrelide \n\ntreatment. In earlier, open-label studies, median platelet count reductions were observed in 7 children \n\nand 9 adolescents treated for between 3 months and 6.5 years. \n\n \n\nThe average total daily dose of anagrelide across all studies in paediatric patients with ET was highly \n\nvariable, but overall the data suggest that adolescents could follow similar starting and maintenance \n\ndoses to adults and that a lower starting dose of 0.5 mg/day would be more appropriate for children \n\n\n\n10 \n\nover 6 years (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2). In all paediatric patients, careful titration to a patient-\n\nspecific daily dose is needed. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral administration of anagrelide in man, at least 70% is absorbed from the gastrointestinal \n\ntract. In fasted subjects, peak plasma levels occur about 1 hour after administration. Pharmacokinetic \n\ndata from healthy subjects established that food decreases the Cmax of anagrelide by 14%, but increases \n\nthe AUC by 20%. Food also decreased the Cmax of the active metabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, by \n\n29%, although it had no effect on the AUC. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nAnagrelide is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 to form, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, which is further \n\nmetabolised via CYP1A2 to the inactive metabolite, 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline. \n\n \n\nThe effect of omeprazole, a CYP1A2 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide was investigated \n\nin 20 healthy adult subjects following multiple, once daily 40-mg doses. The results showed that in the \n\npresence of omeprazole, AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-t), and Cmax of anagrelide were reduced by 27%, 26%, and \n\n36%, respectively; and the corresponding values for 3-hydroxy anagrelide, a metabolite of anagrelide, \n\nwere reduced by 13%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe plasma half-life of anagrelide is short, approximately 1.3 hours and as expected from its half-life, \n\nthere is no evidence for anagrelide accumulation in the plasma. Less than 1% is recovered in the urine \n\nas anagrelide. The mean recovery of 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline in urine is \n\napproximately 18-35% of the administered dose. \n\n \n\nAdditionally these results show no evidence of auto-induction of the anagrelide clearance. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nDose proportionality has been found in the dose range 0.5 mg to 2 mg. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nPharmacokinetic data from exposed fasting children and adolescents (age range 7 through 16 years) \n\nwith essential thrombocythaemia indicate that dose normalised exposure, Cmax and AUC, of anagrelide \n\ntended to be higher in children/adolescents compared with adults. There was also a trend to higher \n\ndose-normalised exposure to the active metabolite. \n\n \n\nElderly  \n\nPharmacokinetic data from fasting elderly patients with ET (age range 65 through 75 years) compared \n\nto fasting adult patients (age range 22 through 50 years) indicate that the Cmax and AUC of anagrelide \n\nwere 36% and 61% higher respectively in elderly patients, but that the Cmax and AUC of the active \n\nmetabolite, 3-hydroxy anagrelide, were 42% and 37% lower respectively in the elderly patients. These \n\ndifferences were likely to be caused by lower presystemic metabolism of anagrelide to 3-hydroxy \n\nanagrelide in the elderly patients. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nRepeated dose toxicity \n\nFollowing repeated oral administration of anagrelide in dogs, subendocardial haemorrhage and focal \n\nmyocardial necrosis was observed at 1mg/kg/day or higher in males and females with males being \n\nmore sensitive. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for male dogs (0.3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to \n\n0.1-, 0.1-, and 1.6-fold the AUC in humans for anagrelide at 2 mg/day, and the metabolites BCH24426 \n\nand RL603, respectively. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nReproductive toxicology \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nIn male rats, anagrelide at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (>1000 times a 2-mg/day dose, based on \n\nbody surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance. In female \n\nrats increases in pre- and post-implantation losses and a decrease in the mean number of live embryos \n\nwas observed at 30 mg/kg/day. The NOEL (10 mg/kg/day) to this effect was 143-, 12- and 11-fold \n\nhigher than the AUC in humans administered a dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day, and the metabolites \n\nBCH24426 and RL603, respectively. \n\n \n\nEmbryofoetal development studies \n\nMaternally toxic doses of anagrelide in rats and rabbits were associated with increased embryo \n\nresorption and foetal mortality. \n\n \n\nIn a pre- and post-natal development study in female rats, anagrelide at oral doses of ≥10 mg/kg \n\nproduced a non-adverse increase in gestational duration. At the NOEL dose (3 mg/kg/day), the AUCs \n\nfor anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and RL603 were 14-, 2- and 2-fold higher than the \n\nAUC in humans administered an oral dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day. \n\n \n\nAnagrelide at ≥60 mg/kg increased parturition time and mortality in the dam and foetus, respectively. \n\nAt the NOEL dose (30 mg/kg/day), the AUCs for anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and \n\nRL603 were 425-, 31- and 13-fold higher than the AUC in humans administered an oral dose of \n\nanagrelide 2 mg/day, respectively. \n\n \n\nMutagenic and carcinogenic potential \n\nStudies on the genotoxic potential of anagrelide did not identify any mutagenic or clastogenic effects. \n\n \n\nIn a two-year rat carcinogenicity study, non-neoplastic and neoplastic findings were observed and \n\nrelated or attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological effect. Among them, the incidence of adrenal \n\nphaeochromocytomas was increased relative to control in males at all dose levels (3 mg/kg/day) and \n\nin females receiving 10 mg/kg/day and above. The lowest dose in males (3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to \n\n37 times the human AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily dose. Uterine adenocarcinomas, of \n\nepigenetic origin, could be related to an enzyme induction of CYP1 family. They were observed in \n\nfemales receiving 30 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 572 times the human AUC exposure after a 1-mg \n\ntwice daily dose.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What you need to know before you take Xagrid \n\n3. How to take Xagrid \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Xagrid \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Xagrid is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nXagrid contains the active substance, anagrelide. Xagrid is a medicine which interferes with the \n\ndevelopment of platelets. It reduces the number of platelets produced by the bone marrow, which \n\nresults in a decrease in the platelet count in the blood towards a more normal level. For this reason, it \n\nis used to treat patients with essential thrombocythaemia. \n\n \n\nEssential thrombocythaemia is a condition which occurs when the bone marrow produces too many of \n\nthe blood cells known as platelets. Large numbers of platelets in the blood can cause serious problems \n\nwith blood circulation and clotting. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.
