CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nUptravi is indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult \npatients with WHO functional class (FC) II–III, either as combination therapy in patients insufficiently \ncontrolled with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and/or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) \ninhibitor, or as monotherapy in patients who are not candidates for these therapies. \n \nEfficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH \nassociated with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital \nheart disease (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of PAH. \n \nPosology \n \nIndividualised dose titration \nEach patient should be up-titrated to the highest individually tolerated dose, which can range from \n200 micrograms given twice daily to 1,600 micrograms given twice daily (individualised maintenance \ndose). \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 200 micrograms given twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. \nThe dose is increased in increments of 200 micrograms given twice daily, usually at weekly intervals. \nAt the beginning of treatment and at each up-titration step it is recommended to take the first dose in \nthe evening. During dose titration some adverse reactions, reflecting the mode of action of Uptravi \n(such as headache, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, jaw pain, myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, \nand flushing), may occur. They are usually transient or manageable with symptomatic treatment (see \nsection 4.8). However, if a patient reaches a dose that cannot be tolerated, the dose should be reduced \nto the previous dose level.  \n \nIn patients in whom up-titration was limited by reasons other than adverse reactions reflecting the \nmode of action of Uptravi, a second attempt to continue up-titration to the highest individually \ntolerated dose up to a maximum dose of 1,600 micrograms twice daily may be considered. \n \nIndividualised maintenance dose \nThe highest tolerated dose reached during dose titration should be maintained. If the therapy over time \n\n\n\n4 \n\nis less tolerated at a given dose, symptomatic treatment and/or a dose reduction to the next lower dose \nshould be considered. \n \nInterruptions and discontinuations \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. The missed dose should not be taken if the \nnext scheduled dose is within approximately 6 hours. \n \nIf treatment is missed for 3 days or more, Uptravi should be restarted at a lower dose and then \nup-titrated. \n \nThere is limited experience with abrupt discontinuation of Uptravi in patients with PAH. No evidence \nfor acute rebound has been observed. \n \nHowever, if the decision to withdraw Uptravi is taken, it should be done gradually while an alternative \ntherapy is introduced. \n \nDosage Adjustment with Co-administration of Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors \nWhen co-administered with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel, deferasirox and \nteriflunomide), reduce the dosing of Uptravi to once daily. If the therapy is not tolerated at a given \ndose, symptomatic treatment and/or a dose reduction to the next lower dose should be considered.  \nRevert to twice daily dosing frequency of Uptravi when co-administration of moderate CYP2C8 \ninhibitor is stopped (see section 4.5). \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \nNo adjustment to the dose regimen is needed in elderly people (see section 5.2). There is limited \nclinical experience in patients over the age of 75 years, therefore Uptravi should be used with caution \nin this population (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nUptravi should not be administered in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C; see \nsection 4.4). For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the starting dose of \nUptravi should be 200 micrograms once daily, and increased at weekly intervals by increments of \n200 micrograms given once daily until adverse reactions, reflecting the mode of action of selexipag, \nthat cannot be tolerated or medically managed are experienced. No adjustment to the dose regimen is \nneeded in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A).  \n \nRenal impairment \nNo adjustment to the dose regimen is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. No \nchange in starting dose is required in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2); dose titration should be done with caution in these \npatients (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population (< 18 years) \nThe safety and efficacy of Uptravi in children aged 0 to less than 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. Administration of selexipag in the paediatric population is not \nrecommended. Animal studies indicated an increased risk of intussusception, but the clinical relevance \nof these findings is unknown (see section 5.3). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. \n \nThe film-coated tablets are to be taken orally in the morning and in the evening. To improve \ntolerability, it is recommended to take Uptravi with food and, at the beginning of each up-titration \nphase, to take the first increased dose in the evening. \n \nThe tablets should not be split, crushed or chewed, and are to be swallowed with water. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nPatients who have poor vision or are blind must be instructed to get assistance from another person \nwhen taking Uptravi during the titration period. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina. \n• Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months. \n• Decompensated cardiac failure if not under close medical supervision. \n• Severe arrhythmias. \n• Cerebrovascular events (e.g., transient ischaemic attack, stroke) within the last 3 months. \n• Congenital or acquired valvular defects with clinically relevant myocardial function disorders \n\nnot related to pulmonary hypertension. \n• Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil; see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension \n \nUptravi has vasodilatory properties that may result in lowering of blood pressure. Before prescribing \nUptravi, physicians should carefully consider whether patients with certain underlying conditions \ncould be adversely affected by vasodilatory effects (e.g., patients on antihypertensive therapy or with \nresting hypotension, hypovolaemia, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction or autonomic \ndysfunction).  \n \nHyperthyroidism \n \nHyperthyroidism has been observed with Uptravi. Thyroid function tests are recommended as \nclinically indicated in the presence of signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. \n \nPulmonary veno-occlusive disease \n \nCases of pulmonary oedema have been reported with vasodilators (mainly prostacyclins) when used in \npatients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Consequently, if signs of pulmonary oedema occur \nwhen Uptravi is administered in patients with PAH, the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive \ndisease should be considered. If confirmed, treatment with Uptravi should be discontinued. \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years) \n \nThere is limited clinical experience with selexipag in patients over the age of 75 years, therefore \nUptravi should be used with caution in this population (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThere is no clinical experience with selexipag in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass C), therefore Uptravi should not be administered in these patients. The exposure to selexipag and \nits active metabolite is increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B; \nsee section 5.2). In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, Uptravi should be dosed once daily \n(see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), caution should be exercised \nduring dose titration. There is no experience with Uptravi in patients undergoing dialysis (see \nsection 5.2), therefore Uptravi should not be used in these patients. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should practise effective contraception while taking selexipag. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on selexipag \n \nSelexipag is hydrolysed to its active metabolite by carboxylesterases (see section 5.2). Selexipag and \nits active metabolite both undergo oxidative metabolism mainly by CYP2C8 and to a smaller extent by \nCYP3A4. The glucuronidation of the active metabolite is catalysed by UGT1A3 and UGT2B7. \nSelexipag and its active metabolite are substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Selexipag is a weak \nsubstrate of the P-gp efflux pump. The active metabolite is a weak substrate of the breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP). \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite are not affected by warfarin. \n \nInhibitors of CYP2C8 \nIn the presence of 600 mg gemfibrozil, twice a day, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, exposure to \nselexipag increased approximately 2-fold, whereas exposure to the active metabolite, the major \ncontributor to efficacy, increased approximately 11-fold. Concomitant administration of Uptravi with \nstrong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant administration of Uptravi with clopidogrel (loading dose of 300 mg or maintenance dose \nof 75 mg once a day), a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no relevant effect on the exposure to \nselexipag but increased the exposure to the active metabolite approximately 2.2 and 2.7-fold following \nloading dose and maintenance dose, respectively. Dosing frequency of Uptravi should be reduced to \nonce daily when co-administered with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel, deferasirox, \nteriflunomide). Dosing frequency of Uptravi should be reverted to twice daily when co-administration \nof moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor is stopped (see section 4.2).  \n \nInducers of CYP2C8 \nIn the presence of 600 mg rifampicin, once a day, an inducer of CYP2C8 (and UGT enzymes), the \nexposure to selexipag did not change, whereas exposure to the active metabolite was reduced by half. \nDose adjustment of selexipag may be required with concomitant administration of inducers of \nCYP2C8 (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin). \n \nInhibitors of UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 \nThe effect of strong inhibitors of UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 (valproic acid, probenecid, and fluconazole) \non the exposure to selexipag and its active metabolite has not been studied. Caution is required when \nadministering these medicinal products concomitantly with Uptravi. A potential pharmacokinetic \ninteraction with strong inhibitors of UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 cannot be excluded. \n \nInhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 \nIn the presence of 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, exposure to \nselexipag increased approximately 2-fold, whereas the exposure to the active metabolite of selexipag \ndid not change. Given the 37-fold higher potency of the active metabolite, this effect is not clinically \nrelevant. Since a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the active \nmetabolite, indicating that the CYP3A4 pathway is not important in the elimination of the active \nmetabolite, no effect of inducers of CYP3A4 on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite is \nexpected. \n \nPAH-specific therapies \nIn the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trial in patients with PAH, the use of selexipag in combination with \nboth an ERA and a PDE-5 inhibitor resulted in a 30% lower exposure to the active metabolite.  \n \nTransporter inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn the presence of 400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily, a strong OATP (OATP1B1 and \nOATP1B3) and P-gp inhibitor, exposure to selexipag increased approximately 2-fold, whereas the \nexposure to the active metabolite of selexipag did not change. Given that the majority of the \npharmacological effect is driven by the active metabolite, this effect is not clinically relevant. \n \nEffect of selexipag on other medicinal products \n \nSelexipag and its active metabolite do not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and transport \nproteins at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n \nAnticoagulants or inhibitors of platelet aggregation  \nSelexipag is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation in vitro. In the Phase 3 placebo-controlled study in \npatients with PAH, no increased risk of bleeding was detected with selexipag compared to placebo, \nincluding when selexipag was administered with anticoagulants (such as heparin, coumarin-type \nanticoagulants) or inhibitors of platelet aggregation. In a study in healthy subjects, selexipag \n(400 micrograms twice daily) did not alter the exposure to S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) or \nR-warfarin (CYP3A4 substrate) after a single dose of 20 mg warfarin. Selexipag did not influence the \npharmacodynamic effect of warfarin on the international normalised ratio. \n \nMidazolam  \nAt steady state after up-titration to 1,600 μg selexipag twice a day, no clinically relevant change in \nexposure to midazolam, a sensitive intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 substrate, or its metabolite, \n1-hydroxymidazolam, was observed. Concomitant administration of selexipag with CYP3A4 \nsubstrates does not require dose adjustment. \n \nHormonal contraceptives  \nSpecific drug-drug interaction studies with hormonal contraceptives have not been conducted. Since \nselexipag did not affect the exposure to the CYP3A4 substrates midazolam and R-warfarin or to the \nCYP2C9 substrate S-warfarin, reduced efficacy of hormonal contraceptives is not expected. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should practise effective contraception while taking selexipag. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of selexipag in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Selexipag and its main metabolite \nshowed 20- to 80-times lower prostacyclin (IP) receptor potency in vitro for animal species used in \nreproductive toxicity testing compared to humans. Therefore, safety margins for potential \nIP receptor-mediated effects on reproduction are accordingly lower than for non-IP-related effects (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nUptravi is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether selexipag or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, selexipag or its \nmetabolites are excreted in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \nUptravi should not be used during breast-feeding.  \n \nFertility \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThere are no clinical data available. In rat studies, selexipag at high doses caused transient \ndisturbances in oestrus cycles that did not affect fertility (see section 5.3). The relevance for humans is \nnot known. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nUptravi has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of the patient \nand the adverse reaction profile of selexipag (such as headache or hypotension) should be kept in mind \nwhen considering the patient’s ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, jaw \npain, myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, and flushing. These reactions are more frequent during the \nup-titration phase. The majority of these reactions are of mild to moderate intensity. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe safety of selexipag has been evaluated in a long-term, Phase 3 placebo-controlled study enrolling \n1,156 patients with symptomatic PAH. The mean treatment duration was 76.4 weeks (median \n70.7 weeks) for patients receiving selexipag versus 71.2 weeks (median 63.7 weeks) for patients on \nplacebo. The exposure to selexipag was up to 4.2 years.  \n \nAdverse reactions obtained from the pivotal clinical study are tabulated below. Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem organ class Very common \n(≥ 1/10) \n\nCommon \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n\nBlood and lymphatic \ndisorders \n\n Anaemia \nHaemoglobin decreased \n\n \n\nEndocrine disorders  Hyperthyroidism \nThyroid-stimulating \nHormone decreased (see \nsection 4.4) \n\n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\n Decreased appetite \nWeight decrease \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache*   \n\nCardiac disorders   Sinus tachycardia \nVascular disorders Flushing* Hypotension (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nNasopharyngitis (of \nnon-infectious \norigin) \n\nNasal congestion  \n\nGastro-intestinal \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea* \nVomiting * \nNausea* \n\nAbdominal pain  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash \nUrticaria \nErythema \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nJaw pain* \nMyalgia* \nArthralgia* \nPain in extremity* \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Pain  \n\n* See section Description of selected adverse reactions. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPharmacological effects associated with titration and maintenance treatment \nAdverse reactions associated with the mode of action of selexipag have been observed frequently, in \nparticular during the phase of individualised dose titration, and are tabulated below:  \n \n\nProstacyclin-like associated \nadverse reactions  \n\nTitration Maintenance \nSelexipag Placebo Selexipag Placebo \n\nHeadache 64% 28% 40% 20% \nDiarrhoea 36% 12% 30% 13% \nNausea 29% 13% 20% 10% \nPain in jaw 26% 4% 21% 4% \nMyalgia 15% 5% 9% 3% \nPain in extremity 14% 5% 13% 6% \nVomiting 14% 4% 8% 6% \nFlushing 11% 4% 10% 3% \nArthralgia 7% 5% 9% 5% \n\n \nThese effects are usually transient or manageable with symptomatic treatment. 7.5% of patients on \nselexipag discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions. The approximate rate of adverse \nreactions that were serious was 2.3% in the selexipag group and 0.5% in the placebo group. In clinical \npractice, gastro-intestinal events have been observed to respond to anti-diarrhoeal, anti-emetic, and \nanti-nauseant medicinal products and/or medicinal products for functional gastro-intestinal disorders. \nPain-associated events have frequently been treated with analgesics (such as paracetamol). \n \nHaemoglobin decrease \nIn a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study in patients with PAH, mean absolute changes in haemoglobin at \nregular visits compared to baseline ranged from −0.34 to −0.02 g/dL in the selexipag group compared \nto −0.05 to 0.25 g/dL in the placebo group. A decrease from baseline in haemoglobin concentration to \nbelow 10 g/dL was reported in 8.6% of selexipag-treated patients and 5.0% of placebo-treated \npatients. \n \nThyroid function tests \nIn a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study in patients with PAH, hyperthyroidism was reported for 1.6% of \npatients in the selexipag group, compared to no case in the placebo group (see section 4.4). A \nreduction (up to −0.3 MU/L from a baseline median of 2.5 MU/L) in median thyroid-stimulating \nhormone was observed at most visits in the selexipag group. In the placebo group, little change in \nmedian values was apparent. There were no mean changes in triiodothyronine or thyroxine in either \ngroup. \n \nIncrease in heart rate \nIn the Phase 3 placebo-controlled study in patients with PAH, a transient increase in mean heart rate of \n3–4 bpm at 2–4 hours post-dose was observed. Electrocardiogram investigations showed sinus \ntachycardia in 11.3% of patients in the selexipag group compared to 8.8% in the placebo group (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n10 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIsolated cases of overdose up to 3,200 micrograms were reported. Mild, transient nausea was the only \nreported consequence. In the event of overdose, supportive measures must be taken as required. \nDialysis is unlikely to be effective because selexipag and its active metabolite are highly protein \nbound. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, \nATC code: B01AC27 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSelexipag is a selective IP receptor agonist distinct from prostacyclin and its analogues. Selexipag is \nhydrolysed by carboxylesterases to yield its active metabolite, which is approximately 37-fold more \npotent than selexipag. Selexipag and the active metabolite are high-affinity IP receptor agonists with a \nhigh selectivity for the IP receptor versus other prostanoid receptors (EP1–EP4, DP, FP, and TP). \nSelectivity against EP1, EP3, FP, and TP is important because these are well-described contractile \nreceptors in the gastro-intestinal tract and blood vessels. Selectivity against EP2, EP4, and DP1 is \nimportant because these receptors mediate immune depressive effects. \n \nStimulation of the IP receptor by selexipag and the active metabolite leads to vasodilatory as well as \nanti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic effects. Selexipag prevents cardiac and pulmonary remodelling in a \nrat model of PAH and causes proportional decreases in pulmonary and peripheral pressures, indicating \nthat peripheral vasodilation reflects pulmonary pharmacodynamic efficacy. Selexipag does not cause \nIP receptor desensitisation in vitro nor tachyphylaxis in a rat model. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nCardiac electrophysiology  \nIn a thorough QT study in healthy subjects, repeated doses of 800 and 1,600 micrograms of selexipag \ntwice daily did not show an effect on cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval) or conduction (PR and QRS \nintervals) and had a mild accelerating effect on heart rate (the placebo-corrected, baseline-adjusted \nincrease in heart rate reached 6–7 bpm at 1.5 to 3 h after dosing with 800 micrograms selexipag and \n9-10 bpm at the same timepoints after 1,600 micrograms selexipag). \n \nCoagulation factors \nIn Phase 1 and 2 studies a slight decrease in plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was \nobserved with selexipag; the vWF values remained above the lower limit of the normal range.  \n \nPulmonary haemodynamics \nA Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study assessed haemodynamic variables after \n17 weeks of treatment in patients with PAH WHO FC II–III and concomitantly receiving ERAs and/or \nPDE-5 inhibitors. Patients titrating selexipag to an individually tolerated dose (200 micrograms twice \ndaily increments up to 800 micrograms twice daily; N = 33) achieved a statistically significant mean \nreduction in pulmonary vascular resistance of 30.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −44.7%, −12.2%; \np = 0.0045) and an increase in cardiac index (mean treatment effect) of 0.48 L/min/m2 (95% CI: 0.13, \n0.83) compared to placebo (N = 10). \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nEfficacy in patients with PAH \nThe effect of selexipag on progression of PAH was demonstrated in a multi-centre, long-term \n(maximum duration of exposure approximately 4.2 years), double-blind, placebo-controlled, \nparallel-group, event-driven Phase 3 study in 1,156 patients with symptomatic (WHO FC I–IV) PAH. \nPatients were randomised to either placebo (N = 582) or selexipag (N = 574) twice daily. The dose \nwas increased at weekly intervals by increments of 200 micrograms given twice daily to determine the \nindividualised maintenance dose (200–1,600 micrograms twice daily).  \n \nThe primary study endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a morbidity or mortality event up to \nend of treatment, defined as a composite of death (all causes); or hospitalisation for PAH; or \nprogression of PAH resulting in need for lung transplantation or balloon atrial septostomy; or initiation \nof parenteral prostanoid therapy or chronic oxygen therapy; or other disease-progression events \n(patients in WHO FC II or III at baseline) confirmed by a decrease in 6-minute walk distance \n(6MWD) from baseline (≥ 15%) and worsening of WHO FC or (patients in WHO FC III or IV at \nbaseline) confirmed by a decrease in 6MWD from baseline (≥ 15%) and need for additional \nPAH-specific therapy.  \n \nAll events were confirmed by an independent adjudication committee, blinded to treatment allocation.  \n \nThe mean age was 48.1 years (range 18–80 years of age), with the majority of subjects being \nCaucasian (65.0%) and female (79.8%). 17.9% of patients were ≥ 65 and 1.1% ≥ 75 years of age. \nApproximately 1%, 46%, 53%, and 1% of patients were in WHO FC I, II, III and IV, respectively, at \nbaseline. \n \nIdiopathic or heritable PAH was the most common aetiology in the study population (58%) followed \nby PAH due to connective tissue disorders (29%), PAH associated with simple corrected congenital \nheart disease (10%), and PAH associated with other aetiologies (drugs and toxins [2%] and HIV \n[1%]). \n \nAt baseline, the majority of enrolled patients (80%) were being treated with a stable dose of a specific \ntherapy for PAH, either an ERA (15%) or a PDE-5 inhibitor (32%) or both an ERA and a PDE-5 \ninhibitor (33%). \n \nThe overall median double-blind treatment duration was 63.7 weeks for the placebo group and \n70.7 weeks for the selexipag group. 23% of patients on selexipag achieved maintenance doses in the \nrange of 200–400 micrograms, 31% achieved doses in the range of 600–1,000 micrograms, and 43% \nachieved doses in the range of 1,200–1,600 micrograms.  \n \nTreatment with selexipag 200–1,600 micrograms twice daily resulted in a 40% reduction (hazard ratio \n[HR] 0.60; 99% CI: 0.46, 0.78; one-sided log-rank p value < 0.0001) of the occurrence of morbidity or \nmortality events up to 7 days after last dose compared to placebo (Figure 1). The beneficial effect of \nselexipag was primarily attributable to a reduction in hospitalisation for PAH and a reduction in other \ndisease-progression events (Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier estimates of the first morbidity-mortality event \n\n \n \nTable 1 Summary of outcome events \n\nEndpoints & \nstatistics \n\nPatients with an \nevent  Treatment comparison: selexipag vs placebo \n\nPlacebo \n(N=582) \n\nSelexipag \n(N=574) \n\nAbsolute \nrisk \n\nreduction \n\nRelative risk \nreduction \n(99% CI) \n\nHR \n(99% CI) p-value  \n\nMorbidity-\nmortality event a \n\n58.3% 41.8% 16.5% 40% (22%; 54%) \n0.60 \n\n(0.46; 0.78) < 0.0001 \n\nHospitalisation \ndue to PAH b \nn (%) \n\n109 \n(18.7%) \n\n78 \n(13.6%) 5.1% \n\n33% \n(2%; 54%) \n\n0.67 \n(0.46; 0.98) 0.04 \n\nDisease \nprogression b \nn (%) \n\n100 \n(17.2%) \n\n38 \n(6.6%) 10.6% \n\n64% \n(41%; 78%) \n\n0.36 \n(0.22; 0.59) < 0.0001 \n\n\n\n13 \n\ni.v./s.c.  \nProstanoid \ninitiation or \noxygen therapy b c \nn (%) \n\n15 \n(2.6%) \n\n11 \n(1.9%) 0.7% \n\n32% \n(−90%; 76%) \n\n0.68 \n(0.24; 1.90) 0.53 \n\nDeath up to EOT \n+ 7 daysd \nn (%) \n\n37 \n(6.4%) \n\n46 \n(8.0%) −1.7% \n\n−17% \n(−107%;34%) \n\n1.17 \n(0.66, 2.07) 0.77 \n\nDeath up to study \nclosure d \nn (%) \n\n105 \n(18.0%) \n\n100 \n(17.4%) 0.6% \n\n3% \n(−39%; 32%) \n\n0.97 \n(0.68; 1.39) 0.42 \n\nCI = confidence interval; EOT = end of treatment; HR = hazard ratio; i.v. = intravenous; PAH = pulmonary arterial \nhypertension; s.c. = subcutaneous. \n\n(a) % of patients with an event at 36 months = 100 × (1 – Kaplan-Meier estimate); hazard ratio estimated using Cox’s \nproportional hazard model; unstratified one-sided log-rank p-value \n\n(b) % of patients with an event as part of the primary endpoint up to EOT + 7 days; hazard ratio estimated using Aalen \nJohansen method; 2-sided p-value using Gray’s test \n\n(c) Includes ‘Need for lung transplantation or atrial septostomy’ (1 patient on selexipag and 2 on placebo) \n(d) % of patients with an event up to EOT + 7 days or up to study closure; hazard ratio estimated using Cox’s proportional \n\nhazard model; unstratified one-sided log-rank p-value \n \nThe numerical increase in deaths up to end of treatment + 7 days but not up to study closure was \nfurther investigated by mathematical modelling, showing that the imbalance in deaths is consistent \nwith the assumption of a neutral effect on PAH mortality and reduction of non-fatal events. \n \nThe observed effect of selexipag versus placebo on the primary endpoint was consistent across \nindividualised maintenance dose as shown by the hazard ratio for the three pre-defined categories \n(0.60 for 200–400 micrograms twice daily, 0.53 for 600–1,000 micrograms twice daily, and 0.64 for \n1,200–1,600 micrograms twice daily), which was consistent with the overall treatment effect (0.60). \n \nThe efficacy of selexipag on the primary endpoint was consistent across subgroups of age, sex, race, \naetiology, geographical region, WHO FC, and as monotherapy or in combination with an ERA or a \nPDE-5 inhibitor or triple combination with both an ERA and a PDE-5 inhibitor. \n \nTime to PAH-related death or hospitalisation for PAH was assessed as a secondary endpoint. The risk \nof an event for this endpoint was reduced by 30% in patients receiving selexipag compared to placebo \n(HR 0.70, 99% CI: 0.50, 0.98; one-sided log-rank p = 0.0031). The percentages of patients with an \nevent at Month 36 were 28.9% and 41.3% in the selexipag and placebo groups, respectively, with an \nabsolute risk reduction of 12.4%.  \n \nThe number of patients who experienced, as a first event, death due to PAH or hospitalisation for PAH \nup to end of treatment was 102 (17.8%) in the selexipag group and 137 (23.5%) in the placebo group. \nDeath due to PAH as a component of the endpoint was observed in 16 (2.8%) patients on selexipag \nand 14 (2.4%) on placebo. Hospitalisation for PAH was observed in 86 (15.0%) patients on selexipag \nand 123 (21.1%) patients on placebo. Selexipag reduced the risk of hospitalisation for PAH as a first \noutcome event compared to placebo (HR 0.67, 99% CI: 0.46, 0.98; one-sided log-rank p = 0.04). \n \nThe total number of deaths of all causes up to study closure was 100 (17.4%) for the selexipag group \nand 105 (18.0%) for the placebo group (HR 0.97, 99% CI: 0.68, 1.39). The number of deaths due to \nPAH up to study closure was 70 (12.2%) for the selexipag group and 83 (14.3%) for the placebo \ngroup. \n \nSymptomatic endpoints \nExercise capacity was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Median 6MWD at baseline was 376 m \n(range: 90–482 m) and 369 m (range: 50–515 m) in selexipag patients and placebo patients, \nrespectively. Treatment with selexipag resulted in a placebo-corrected median effect on 6MWD \nmeasured at trough (i.e., approximately 12 h post-dose) of 12 m at Week 26 (99% CI: 1, 24 m; \n\n\n\n14 \n\none-sided p value = 0.0027). In patients without concurrent PAH-specific therapy, the \nplacebo-corrected treatment effect measured at trough was 34 m (99% CI: 10, 63 m). \n \nQuality of life was assessed in a subset of patients in the GRIPHON study using the Cambridge \nPulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) questionnaire. There was no significant \ntreatment effect from baseline to Week 26. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nUptravi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for treatment of pulmonary hypertension, \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite have been studied primarily in healthy \nsubjects. The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and the active metabolite, both after single- and \nmultiple-dose administration, were dose-proportional up to a single dose of 800 micrograms and \nmultiple doses of up to 1,800 micrograms twice daily. After multiple-dose administration, steady state \nconditions of selexipag and the active metabolite were reached within 3 days. No accumulation in \nplasma, either of parent compound or active metabolite, occurred after multiple-dose administration. \n \nIn healthy subjects, inter-subject variability in exposure (area under the curve over a dosing interval) at \nsteady state was 43% and 39% for selexipag and the active metabolite, respectively. Intra-subject \nvariability in exposure was 24% and 19% for selexipag and the active metabolite, respectively. \n \nExposure to selexipag and the active metabolite at steady state in PAH patients and healthy subjects \nwas similar. The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and the active metabolite in PAH patients were not \ninfluenced by the severity of the disease and did not change with time. \n \nAbsorption \n \nSelexipag is rapidly absorbed and is hydrolysed by carboxylesterases to its active metabolite.  \n \nMaximum observed plasma concentrations of selexipag and its active metabolite after oral \nadministration are reached within 1–3 h and 3–4 h, respectively. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of selexipag in humans is approximately 49%. This is most probably due \nto a first-pass effect of selexipag, as plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are similar after \nthe same oral and intravenous dose administration. \n \nIn the presence of food, the exposure to selexipag after a single dose of 400 micrograms was increased \nby 10% in Caucasian subjects and decreased by 15% in Japanese subjects, whereas exposure to the \nactive metabolite was decreased by 27% (Caucasian subjects) and 12% (Japanese subjects). More \nsubjects reported adverse events after administration in the fasted than in the fed state. \n \nDistribution \n \nSelexipag and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 99% in total \nand to the same extent to albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein). The volume of distribution of \nselexipag at steady state is 11.7 L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nSelexipag is hydrolysed to its active metabolite in the liver and in the intestine by carboxylesterases. \nOxidative metabolism catalysed mainly by CYP2C8 and to a smaller extent by CYP3A4 leads to the \nformation of hydroxylated and dealkylated products. UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 are involved in the \n\n\n\n15 \n\nglucuronidation of the active metabolite. Except for the active metabolite, none of the circulating \nmetabolites in human plasma exceed 3% of the total drug-related material. Both in healthy subjects \nand PAH patients, after oral administration, exposure at steady state to the active metabolite is \napproximately 3- to 4-fold higher than to the parent compound. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination of selexipag is predominantly via metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of 0.8–2.5 h. \nThe active metabolite has a half-life of 6.2–13.5 h. The total body clearance of selexipag is 17.9 L/h. \nExcretion in healthy subjects was complete 5 days after administration and occurred primarily via \nfaeces (accounting for 93% of the administered dose) compared to 12% in urine. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nNo clinically relevant effects of sex, race, age, or body weight on the pharmacokinetics of selexipag \nand its active metabolite have been observed in healthy subjects or PAH patients. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nA 1.4- to 1.7-fold increase in exposure (maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma \nconcentration-time curve) to selexipag and its active metabolite was observed in subjects with severe \nrenal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, \nexposure to selexipag was 2- and 4-fold higher, respectively, when compared to healthy subjects. \nExposure to the active metabolite remained almost unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic \nimpairment and was doubled in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Only two subjects with \nsevere (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment were dosed with selexipag. Exposure to selexipag and \nits active metabolite in these two subjects was similar to that in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh \nclass B) hepatic impairment. \n \nBased on modelling and simulation data from a study in subjects with hepatic impairment, the \nexposure to selexipag at steady state in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclass B) after a once-daily regimen is predicted to be approximately 2-fold higher than that in healthy \nsubjects during a twice-daily regimen. The exposure to the active metabolite at steady state in these \npatients during a once-daily regimen is predicted to be similar to that in healthy subjects during a \ntwice-daily regimen. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) showed similar \npredicted exposure at steady state as subjects with moderate hepatic impairment during a once-daily \nregimen. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn the repeated-dose toxicity studies in rodents, strong blood pressure decrease as a result of \nexaggerated pharmacology induced transient clinical signs and reduced food consumption and \nbody-weight gain. In adult and juvenile dogs, intestine and bone / bone marrow were identified as the \nmain target organs after treatment with selexipag. A delay in the closure of the femoral and/or tibial \nepiphyseal growth plate was observed in juvenile dogs. A no-observed-adverse-effect level was not \nestablished. In juvenile dogs, intussusception due to prostacyclin-related effects on intestinal motility \nwas observed sporadically. Safety margins adapted for IP receptor potency for the active metabolite \nwere 2-fold (based on total exposure) in relation to human therapeutic exposure. The finding did not \noccur in mouse or rat toxicity studies. Because of the species-specific sensitivity of dogs to develop \nintussusception, this finding is considered not relevant for adult humans.  \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nIncreased bone ossification and related changes in the bone marrow in dog studies are considered to be \ndue to the activation of EP4 receptors in dogs. As human EP4 receptors are not activated by selexipag \nor its active metabolite, this effect is species-specific and, therefore, not relevant to humans.  \n \nSelexipag and the active metabolite are not genotoxic on the basis of the overall evidence of conducted \ngenotoxicity studies. \n \nIn the 2-year carcinogenicity studies, selexipag caused an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas in \nmice and Leydig cell adenomas in rats. The mechanisms are rodent-specific. Tortuosity of retinal \narterioles was noted after 2 years of treatment only in rats. Mechanistically, the effect is considered to \nbe induced by life-long vasodilation and subsequent changes in ocular haemodynamics. Additional \nhistopathological findings of selexipag were observed only at exposures sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to humans.  \n \nIn a fertility study performed in rats, a prolongation of oestrus cycles resulting in increases in days \nuntil copulation was observed at exposures 173-fold above therapeutic exposures (based on total \nexposures), the no-observed-effect level being 30-fold above therapeutic exposures. Otherwise, \nfertility parameters were not affected. \n \nSelexipag was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits (exposure margins above therapeutic exposure of \n13-fold for selexipag and 43-fold for the active metabolite, based on total exposure). Safety margins \nfor potential IP receptor-related effects on reproduction were 20 for fertility and 5 and 1 (based on free \nexposure) for embryo-foetal development in rats and rabbits, respectively, when adapted for \ndifferences in receptor potency. In the rat pre-/post-natal development study, selexipag induced no \neffects on maternal and pup reproductive function. \n \n \n6.

What Uptravi is and what it is used for \n \nUptravi is a medicine that contains the active substance selexipag. It acts on blood vessels in a similar \nway to the natural substance prostacyclin, making them relax and widen. \n \nUptravi is used for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients \ninsufficiently controlled with other types of medicines for PAH known as endothelin receptor \nantagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Uptravi can be used on its own if the patient is not \na candidate for these medicines.  \n \nPAH is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (the \npulmonary arteries). In people with PAH, these arteries narrow, so the heart has to work harder to \npump blood through them. This may cause people to feel tired, dizzy, short of breath, or experience \nother symptoms. \n \nBy mimicking the action of prostacyclin, Uptravi widens the pulmonary arteries and reduces their \nhardening. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. It relieves \nthe symptoms of PAH and improves the course of the disease. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Uptravi \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nDo not take Uptravi \n \n- if you are allergic to selexipag or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have a heart problem, such as: \n\n- poor blood flow to the heart muscles (severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina); \nsymptoms can include chest pain \n\n- heart attack within the last 6 months \n- weak heart (decompensated cardiac failure) that is not under close medical observation \n- severe irregular heartbeat \n- defect of the heart valves (inborn or acquired) that causes the heart to work poorly (not \n\nrelated to pulmonary hypertension) \n- if you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other occurrence that reduced the blood \n\nsupply to the brain (e.g., transient ischaemic attack) \n- if you are taking gemfibrozil (medicine used to lower the level of fats [lipids] in the blood) \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your PAH doctor or nurse before taking Uptravi if you \n- are taking medicines for high blood pressure  \n- have low blood pressure associated with symptoms such as dizziness \n- have recently experienced significant blood loss or fluid loss such as severe diarrhoea or \n\nvomiting \n- have problems with your thyroid gland \n- have severe problems with your kidneys or are undergoing dialysis \n- have or have had severe problems with your liver not working properly \n \nIf you notice any of the above signs or your condition changes, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children under 18 years of age, because Uptravi has not been tested in \nchildren. \n \nElderly patients \n \nThere is limited experience with Uptravi in patients older than 75 years. Uptravi should be used with \ncaution in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Uptravi \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \nTaking other medicines may affect how Uptravi works. \n \nTalk to your PAH doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- Gemfibrozil (medicine used to lower the level of fats [lipids] in the blood) \n- Clopidogrel (medicine used to inhibit blood clots in coronary artery disease) \n- Deferasirox (medicine used to remove iron from the blood stream) \n- Teriflunomide (medicine used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis) \n- Carbamazepine (medicine used to treat some forms of epilepsy, nerve pain or to help control \n\nserious mood disorders when some other medicines do not work) \n- Phenytoin (medicine used to treat epilepsy) \n- Valproic acid (medicine used to treat epilepsy) \n- Probenecid (medicine used to treat gout) \n- Fluconazole, rifampicin or rifapentine (antibiotics used to treat infections) \n \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nUptravi is not recommended during pregnancy and breast-feeding. If you are a woman who can have \nchildren, you should use an effective contraceptive method while taking Uptravi. If you are pregnant \nor breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for \nadvice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nUptravi can cause side effects such as headaches and low blood pressure (see section 4), which may \naffect your ability to drive; the symptoms of your condition can also make you less fit to drive.  \n \n \n3. How to take Uptravi \n \nUptravi should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the treatment of PAH. Always take \nUptravi exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not sure or have any \nquestions. \n \nTell your doctor if you experience side effects, as your doctor may recommend that you change your \nUptravi dose.  \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking other medications as your doctor may recommend that you take \nUptravi only once daily. \n \nIf you have poor vision or experience any type of blindness, get help from another person when taking \nUptravi during the titration period. \n \nFinding the right dose for you \n \nAt the start of treatment, you will take the lowest dose. This is one 200 microgram tablet in the \nmorning and another 200 microgram tablet in the evening. Treatment should be initiated in the \nevening. Your doctor will instruct you to gradually increase your dose. This is called titration. It lets \nyour body adjust to the new medicine. The goal of titration is to reach the most appropriate dose. This \nwill be the highest dose you can tolerate, which may reach the maximum dose of 1,600 micrograms in \nthe morning and in the evening.  \n \nThe first pack of tablets you receive will contain the light-yellow 200 microgram tablets.  \nYour doctor will tell you to increase your dose in steps, usually every week but the interval between \nincreases could be longer.  \n \nWith each step, you will add one 200 microgram tablet to your morning dose and another \n200 microgram tablet to your evening dose. The first intake of the increased dose should be in the \nevening. The diagram below shows the number of tablets to take every morning and every evening \nfor the first 4 steps. \n \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n \n \nIf your doctor instructs you to further increase your dose and move to step 5, this may be done by \ntaking one green 800 microgram tablet and one light-yellow 200 microgram tablet in the morning and \none 800 microgram tablet and one 200 microgram tablet in the evening.  \n \nIf your doctor tells you to increase your dose further, you will add one 200 microgram tablet to your \nmorning dose and one 200 microgram tablet to your evening dose with each new step. The first intake \nof the increased dose should be in the evening. The maximum dose of Uptravi is 1,600 micrograms in \nthe morning and 1,600 micrograms in the evening. However, not every patient will reach this dose, \nbecause different patients require different doses. \n \nThe diagram below shows the number of tablets to take every morning and every evening at each \nstep, starting with step 5. \n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n \n \nThe titration pack also contains a titration guide providing information on the titration process and \nallowing you to record the number of tablets you take every day.  \n \nRemember to record the number of tablets you take every day in your titration diary. The titration \nsteps usually last about 1 week. If your doctor instructs you to prolong each titration step longer than \n1 week, there are additional diary pages to allow you to track this. Remember to talk to your PAH \ndoctor or nurse regularly during titration. \n \nStepping down to a lower dose due to side effects \n \nDuring titration, you may experience side effects such as headache, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), \nbeing sick (vomiting), jaw pain, muscle pain, leg pain, joint pain, or reddening of the face (see \nsection 4). If these side effects are difficult for you to tolerate, talk to your doctor about how to \nmanage or treat them. There are treatments available that can help relieve the side effects. For \nexample, painkillers such as paracetamol may help treat pain and headache. \n \nIf the side effects cannot be treated or do not gradually get better on the dose you are taking, your \ndoctor may adjust your dose by reducing the number of 200 microgram light-yellow tablets you take \nby one in the morning and by one in the evening. The diagram below shows stepping down to a lower \ndose. Do this only if instructed to do so by your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n \n \nIf your side effects are manageable after stepping down your dose, your doctor may decide that you \nshould stay on that dose. Please see section Maintenance dose below for more information. \n \nMaintenance dose \n \nThe highest dose that you can tolerate during titration will become your maintenance dose. Your \nmaintenance dose is the dose you should continue to take on a regular basis. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe a suitable tablet strength for your maintenance dose. This allows you to \ntake one tablet in the morning and one in the evening, instead of multiple tablets each time. \n \nFor a full description of Uptravi tablets, including colours and marking, please see section 6 of this \nleaflet. \n \nOver time, your doctor may adjust your maintenance dose as needed. \n \nIf, at any time, after taking the same dose for a long time, you experience side effects that you cannot \ntolerate or side effects that have an impact on your normal daily activities, contact your doctor as your \ndose may need to be reduced. The doctor may then prescribe you a lower single-tablet strength. Please \nremember to dispose of unused tablets (see section 5). \n \nTake Uptravi once in the morning and once in the evening, about 12 hours apart. \nTake the tablets with meals as you might tolerate your medicine better. Swallow the tablets whole with \na glass of water. Do not split, crush or chew the tablets. \n \nIf you take more Uptravi than you should \n \nIf you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nIf you forget to take Uptravi \n \nIf you forget to take Uptravi, take a dose as soon as you remember, then continue to take your tablets \nat the usual times. If it is nearly time for your next dose (within 6 hours before you would normally \ntake it), you should skip the missed dose and continue to take your medicine at the usual time. Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. \n \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nIf you stop taking Uptravi \n \nSuddenly stopping your treatment with Uptravi might lead to your symptoms getting worse. Do not \nstop taking Uptravi unless your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may tell you to reduce the dose \ngradually before stopping completely. \n \nIf, for any reason, you stop taking Uptravi for more than 3 consecutive days (if you missed 3 morning \nand 3 evening doses, or 6 doses in a row or more), contact your doctor immediately as your dose \nmay need to be adjusted to avoid side effects. Your doctor may decide to restart your treatment on a \nlower dose, gradually increasing to your previous maintenance dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Uptravi can cause side effects. You may experience side effects not only during \nthe titration period when your dose is being increased, but also later after taking the same dose for a \nlong time.  \n \nIf you experience any of these side effects: headache, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), being sick \n(vomiting), jaw pain, muscle pain, leg pain, joint pain, or reddening of the face, that you cannot \ntolerate or that cannot be treated, you should contact your doctor as the dose you are taking \nmaybe too high for you and may need to be reduced. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- Headache \n- Flushing (reddening of the face) \n- Nausea and vomiting (feeling sick and being sick) \n- Diarrhoea \n- Jaw pain, muscle pain, joint pain, leg pain \n- Nasopharyngitis (stuffy nose) \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- Anaemia (low red blood cell levels) \n- Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) \n- Decreased appetite \n- Weight loss \n- Hypotension (low blood pressure) \n- Stomach pain \n- Pain \n- Changes in some blood test results including those measuring blood cell counts or your thyroid \n\nfunction \n- Rashes, including hives, may cause a burning or stinging sensation and skin redness \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n- Increased heart rate \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you have any side effects, talk to your doctor.

treatment. Tell your doctor if you \nexperience side effects, as your doctor may recommend that you change your Uptravi dose. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking other medications as your doctor may recommend that you take Uptravi only once daily. \n\n \nPage 2       Page 3 \n\nContents \nHow should you take Uptravi? \n...................................4 \nHow should you step up your dose? \n...........................6 \nWhat are the steps? \n.....................................................8 \nWhen should you step down? \n...................................10 \nStepping down \n……………………………………..12 \n \n\n \nWhen you move to your maintenance dose.............14 \nIf you forget to take Uptravi.....................................16 \nIf you stop taking Uptravi.........................................17 \nTitration diary...........................................................18 \n \n \n\n \nPage 4       Page 5 \n\n \nHow should you take Uptravi? \nUptravi is a medicine taken every morning and \nevening for the treatment of pulmonary arterial \nhypertension, also called PAH. \n \nThe starting dose for Uptravi is 200 micrograms once \nin the morning and once in the evening. \nThe first intake of Uptravi should be in the evening. \nYou should take each dose with a glass of water, \npreferably during a meal. \n \n \n \n\n \nThere are 2 phases of treatment with Uptravi: \n \nTitration \nIn the first several weeks, you will work with your \ndoctor to find the dose of Uptravi that is right for \nyou. Your doctor may have you step up from the \nstarting dose to higher doses of Uptravi. Your doctor \nmay step you down to a lower dose. This process is \ncalled titration. It lets your body gradually adjust to \nthe medicine. \n \nMaintenance \nOnce your doctor has found the dose that is right for \nyou, this will be the dose you take on a regular basis. \nThis is called the maintenance dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPage 6       Page 7 \n \nHow should you step up your dose? \n \nYou will start at the 200 microgram dose in the \nmorning and in the evening and after discussing with \nyour doctor or nurse step up to the next dose.  \nThe first intake of the increased dose should be in the \nevening. Each step usually lasts about 1 week. It \ncould take several weeks to find the dose that is right \nfor you. \n \nThe goal is to reach the dose that is most \nappropriate to treat you.  \nThis dose will be your maintenance dose. \n\n \nEvery patient with PAH is different. Not everyone \nwill end up on the same maintenance dose.  \nSome patients may have 200 micrograms in the \nmorning and in the evening as their maintenance \ndose, while some will reach the highest dose of \n1,600 micrograms in the morning and in the evening. \nOthers may reach a maintenance dose somewhere \ninbetween. What is important is that you reach the \ndose that is most appropriate to treat you. \n\n \nPage 8       Page 9 \n\n \n \nPage 10      Page 11 \n\n \n↓When should you step down? \n \nAs with all medicines, you may experience side \neffects with Uptravi as you step up to higher doses.  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you have side \neffects. There are treatments available that can \nhelp relieve them. \n \nThe most common side effects (may affect more than \n1 in 10 people) you may experience while taking \nUptravi are: \n• Headache • Diarrhoea • Nausea • Vomiting • Jaw \npain • Muscle pain • Leg pain • Joint pain • Facial \nredness \n \nFor a full list of side effects see package leaflet for \nfurther information. \n \n\n \nIf you cannot tolerate the side effects even after your \ndoctor or nurse has tried to treat them, he or she may \nrecommend you step down to a lower dose. \n \nIf your doctor or nurse tells you to step down to a \nlower dose, you should take one less \n200 microgram tablet in the morning and one less \nin the evening.  \n \nYou should only step down after speaking with your \nPAH doctor or nurse. This stepping-down process \nwill help you find the dose that is right for you, also \ncalled your maintenance dose. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nPage 12      Page 13 \n\n \n \nPage 14      Page 15 \n\n \nWhen you move to your maintenance dose \n \nThe highest dose that you can tolerate during \ntitration will become your maintenance dose. Your \nmaintenance dose is the dose you should continue to \ntake on a regular basis. Your doctor or nurse can \nprescribe an equivalent single-tablet strength for \nyour maintenance dose. \nThis lets you take just one tablet in the morning \nand one in the evening, instead of multiple tablets \nfor each dose. \n \n\n \nFor example, if your highest tolerated dose during \ntitration was 1,200 micrograms once in the morning \nand once in the evening: \n\n \n \nOver time, your doctor or nurse may adjust your \nmaintenance dose as needed. \n \n\n \nPage 16      Page 17 \n\n \nIf you forget to take Uptravi \n \nIf you miss a dose, take the dose as soon as you \nremember, then continue to take your tablets at the \nusual times. If it is within 6 hours of when you would \nnormally take your next dose, you should skip the \nmissed dose and continue to take your medicine at \nthe usual time.  \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten tablet. \n\n \nIf you stop taking Uptravi \n \nDo not stop taking Uptravi unless your doctor or \nnurse tells you to. If, for any reason, you stop taking \nUptravi for more than 3 consecutive days (if you \nmissed 6 doses in a row), contact your PAH doctor \nor nurse immediately as your dose may need to be \nadjusted to avoid side effects. \n \nYour doctor or nurse may have you resume treatment \nat a lower dose, gradually increasing to your previous \nmaintenance dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nPage 18      Page 19 \n \nTitration diary \n \nPlease read the instructions in the package leaflet \ncarefully. \n \nThe following diary pages help you keep track of the \nnumber of tablets you need to take in the morning and \nevening during titration. \n \nUse them to write down the number of tablets you \ntake in the morning and the evening. \n \nEach step usually lasts about 1 week, unless your \ndoctor or nurse instructs you otherwise. If your \ntitration steps last longer than 1 week there are \nadditional diary pages to track this. \n \n\n        Use pages 20 to 27 to track the first weeks of \ntreatment, when you are using \n200 microgram tablets only (steps 1–4). \n\n   If you have been prescribed both 200 and \n800 microgram tablets, use pages 30 to 37 \n(steps 5–8). \n\n \nRemember to talk to your PAH doctor or nurse \nregularly. \n \nWrite down your doctor or nurse’s instructions: \n \n \n \n \n \nDoctor’s office telephone and e-mail: \n \n \nPharmacist’s telephone: \n \n \nNotes: \n \n\n \nPage 20      Page 21 \n\n \n \nPage 22      Page 23 \n\n \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nPage 24      Page 25 \n\n \n \nPage 26      Page 27 \n\n \n \nPage 28      Page 29 \n\n \nUse the following diary pages if your doctor or nurse \nprescribes 800 microgram tablets in addition to your \n200 microgram tablets.  \n \nOn the diary pages, check off that you have taken one \n800 microgram tablet every day in the morning and in \nthe evening with your prescribed number of \n200 microgram tablets.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \nRemember to talk to your PAH doctor or nurse \nregularly. \n \nWrite down your doctor or nurse’s instructions: \n \n \nDoctor’s office telephone and e-mail: \n \n \nPharmacist’s telephone: \n \n \nNotes: \n \n \n \n\n \nPage 30      Page 31 \n\n \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPage 32      Page 33 \n\n \n \nPage 34      Page 35 \n\n \n \nPage 36      Page 37 \n\n \n \nPage 38      Page 39 \n\nNotes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nPage 40 \n\nActelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
