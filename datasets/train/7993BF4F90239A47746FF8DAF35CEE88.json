NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAZILECT 1 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 1 mg rasagiline (as mesilate).  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet \n \nWhite to off-white, round, flat, bevelled tablets, debossed with \u201cGIL\u201d and \u201c1\u201d underneath on one side \nand plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAZILECT is indicated in adults for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease as monotherapy \n(without levodopa) or as adjunct therapy (with levodopa) in patients with end of dose fluctuations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of rasagiline is 1 mg (one tablet of AZILECT) once daily, to be taken with or \nwithout levodopa. \n \nElderly \nNo change in dose is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nRasagiline is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Rasagiline \nuse in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be avoided. Caution should be used when \ninitiating treatment with rasagiline in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In case patients progress \nfrom mild to moderate hepatic impairment rasagiline should be stopped (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo special precautions are required in patients with renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of AZILECT in children and adolescents have not been established. There is \nno relevant use of AZILECT in the paediatric population in the indication Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use.  \nAZILECT may be taken with or without food. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nConcomitant treatment with other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (including medicinal and \nnatural products without prescription e.g. St. John's Wort) or pethidine (see section 4.5). At least \n14 days must elapse between discontinuation of rasagiline and initiation of treatment with MAO \ninhibitors or pethidine. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nConcomitant use of rasagiline with other medicinal products \n \nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.5). \nAt least five weeks should elapse between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of treatment \nwith rasagiline. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of rasagiline and initiation of \ntreatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine. \n \nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and dextromethorphan or sympathomimetics such as those present \nin nasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal product containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is \nnot recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant use of rasagiline and levodopa \nSince rasagiline potentiates the effects of levodopa, the adverse reactions of levodopa may be \nincreased and pre-existing dyskinesia exacerbated. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate \nthis adverse reaction.  \n \nThere have been reports of hypotensive effects when rasagiline is taken concomitantly with levodopa. \nPatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease are particularly vulnerable to the adverse reactions of hypotension \ndue to existing gait issues. \n \nDopaminergic effects \n \nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sudden sleep onset (SOS) episodes \nRasagiline may cause daytime drowsiness, somnolence, and, occasionally, especially if used with \nother dopaminergic medicinal products - falling asleep during activities of daily living. Patients must \nbe informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during \ntreatment with rasagiline. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden \nsleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines (see section 4.7). \n \nImpulse control disorders (ICDs) \nICDs can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or dopaminergic treatments. Similar \nreports of ICDs have also been received post-marketing with rasagiline. Patients should be regularly \nmonitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware \nof the behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders that were observed in patients treated with \nrasagiline, including cases of compulsions, obsessive thoughts, pathological gambling, increased \nlibido, hypersexuality, impulsive behaviour and compulsive spending or buying. \n \nMelanoma \n \nDuring the clinical development program, the occurrence of cases of melanoma prompted the \nconsideration of a possible association with rasagiline. The data collected suggests that Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, and not any medicinal products in particular, is associated with a higher risk of skin cancer \n(not exclusively melanoma). Any suspicious skin lesion should be evaluated by a specialist. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nHepatic impairment \n \nCaution should be used when initiating treatment with rasagiline in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment. Rasagiline use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be avoided. In case \npatients progress from mild to moderate hepatic impairment, rasagiline should be stopped (see \nsection 5.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nMAO Inhibitors \n \nRasagiline is contraindicated along with other MAO inhibitors (including medicinal and natural \nproducts without prescription e.g. St. John's Wort) as there may be a risk of non-selective MAO \ninhibition that may lead to hypertensive crises (see section 4.3). \n \nPethidine \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of pethidine and MAO \ninhibitors including another selective MAO-B inhibitor. The concomitant administration of rasagiline \nand pethidine is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nSympathomimetics \n \nWith MAO inhibitors there have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant \nuse of sympathomimetic medicinal products. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory activity of \nrasagiline, concomitant administration of rasagiline and sympathomimetics such as those present in \nnasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal products, containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, is \nnot recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nDextromethorphan \n \nThere have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of \ndextromethorphan and non-selective MAO inhibitors. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory \nactivity of rasagiline, the concomitant administration of rasagiline and dextromethorphan is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nSNRI/SSRI/tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants \n \nThe concomitant use of rasagiline and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.4). \n \nFor concomitant use of rasagiline with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/selective \nserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in clinical trials, see section 4.8. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, \ntricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors. Therefore, in view of the MAO inhibitory \nactivity of rasagiline, antidepressants should be administered with caution.  \n \nAgents that affect CYP1A2 activity \n \nIn vitro metabolism studies have indicated that cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the major enzyme \nresponsible for the metabolism of rasagiline.  \n \nCYP1A2 inhibitors \nCo-administration of rasagiline and ciprofloxacin (an inhibitor of CYP1A2) increased the AUC of \nrasagiline by 83%. Co-administration of rasagiline and theophylline (a substrate of CYP1A2) did not \naffect the pharmacokinetics of either product. Thus, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors may alter rasagiline \nplasma levels and should be administered with caution. \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n \nCYP1A2 inducers \nThere is a risk that the plasma levels of rasagiline in smoking patients could be decreased, due to \ninduction of the metabolising enzyme CYP1A2. \n \nOther cytochrome P450 isoenzymes \n \nIn vitro studies showed that rasagiline at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml (equivalent to a level that is \n160 times the average Cmax ~ 5.9-8.5 ng/ml in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients after 1 mg rasagiline \nmultiple dosing), did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP4A. These results indicate that rasagiline\u2019s \ntherapeutic concentrations are unlikely to cause any clinically significant interference with substrates \nof these enzymes (see section 5.3). \n \nLevodopa and other Parkinson\u2019s disease medicinal products  \n \nIn Parkinson\u2019s disease patients receiving rasagiline as adjunct therapy to chronic levodopa treatment, \nthere was no clinically significant effect of levodopa treatment on rasagiline clearance. \n \nConcomitant administration of rasagiline and entacapone increased rasagiline oral clearance by 28%.  \n \nTyramine/rasagiline interaction \n \nResults of five tyramine challenge studies (in volunteers and Parkinson\u2019s disease patients), together \nwith results of home monitoring of blood pressure after meals (of 464 patients treated with 0.5 or \n1 mg/day of rasagiline or placebo as adjunct therapy to levodopa for six months without tyramine \nrestrictions), and the fact that there were no reports of tyramine/rasagiline interaction in clinical \nstudies conducted without tyramine restriction, indicate that rasagiline can be used safely without \ndietary tyramine restrictions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of rasagiline in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of rasagiline during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nNon-clinical data indicate that rasagiline inhibits prolactin secretion and thus, may inhibit lactation. \nIt is not known whether rasagiline is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when \nrasagiline is administered to a breast-feeding mother. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of rasagiline on fertility are available. Non-clinical data indicate that \nrasagiline has no effect on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nIn patients experiencing somnolence/sudden sleep episodes, rasagiline may have major influence on \nthe ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they \nare reasonably certain that rasagiline does not affect them adversely. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nPatients being treated with rasagiline and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes \nmust be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put \nthemselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until they have gained \nsufficient experience with rasagiline and other dopaminergic medications to gauge whether or not it \naffects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. \n \nIf increased somnolence or new episodes of falling asleep during activities of daily living (e.g. \nwatching television, passenger in a car, etc.) are experienced at any time during treatment, the patients \nshould not drive or participate in potentially dangerous activities.  \nPatients should not drive, operate machinery, or work at heights during treatment if they have \npreviously experienced somnolence and/or have fallen asleep without warning prior to use of \nrasagiline.  \n \nPatients should be cautioned about possible additive effects of sedating medicinal products, alcohol, or \nother central nervous system depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) in \ncombination with rasagiline, or when taking concomitant medications that increase plasma levels of \nrasagiline (e.g. ciprofloxacin) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn clinical studies in Parkinson's disease patients the most commonly reported adverse reactions were: \nheadache, depression, vertigo, and flu (influenza and rhinitis) in monotherapy; dyskinesia, orthostatic \nhypotension, fall, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and dry mouth in adjunct to levodopa therapy; \nmusculoskeletal pain, as back and neck pain, and arthralgia in both regimens. These adverse reactions \nwere not associated with an elevated rate of drug discontinuation.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below in Tables 1 and 2 by system organ class and frequency using the \nfollowing conventions: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n \nMonotherapy \nThe tabulated list below includes adverse reactions which were reported with a higher incidence in \nplacebo-controlled studies, in patients receiving 1 mg/day rasagiline. \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n Influenza   \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n(including cysts \nand polyps) \n\n Skin carcinoma   \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n Leucopenia   \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Allergy   \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n  Decreased appetite  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Depression, \nHallucinations* \n\n Impulse control \ndisorders* \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache  Cerebrovascular \naccident \n\nSerotonin \nsyndrome*, \nExcessive daytime \nsleepiness (EDS) \nand sudden sleep \nonset (SOS) \nepisodes* \n\nEye disorders  Conjunctivitis   \nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n Vertigo   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n Angina pectoris Myocardial \ninfarction \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n   Hypertension* \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Rhinitis   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Flatulence   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Dermatitis Vesiculobullous \nrash \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n Musculoskeletal \npain, \nNeck pain, \nArthritis \n\n  \n\nRenal and \nurinary disorders \n\n Urinary urgency   \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n Fever, \nMalaise \n\n  \n\n*See section description of selected adverse reactions \n \nAdjunct Therapy \nThe tabulated list below includes adverse reactions which were reported with a higher incidence in \nplacebo-controlled studies in patients receiving 1 mg/day rasagiline.  \n \nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\nNeoplasms \nbenign, \nmalignant and \nunspecified \n\n  Skin melanoma* \n \n\n \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n Decreased appetite   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Hallucinations*, \nAbnormal dreams \n\nConfusion \n \n\nImpulse control \ndisorders* \n\nNervous system Dyskinesia Dystonia, Cerebrovascular Serotonin \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery common Common Uncommon Not known \n\ndisorders Carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, \nBalance disorder \n\naccident syndrome*, \nExcessive daytime \nsleepiness (EDS) \nand sudden sleep \nonset (SOS) \nepisodes* \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n  Angina pectoris  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Orthostatic \nhypotension* \n\n Hypertension* \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Abdominal pain, \nConstipation, \nNausea and \nvomiting, \nDry mouth \n\n  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Rash   \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders* \n\n Arthralgia, \nNeck pain \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  Decreased weight   \nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\n Fall   \n\n*See section description of selected adverse reactions \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \nIn blinded placebo-controlled studies, severe orthostatic hypotension was reported in one subject \n(0.3%) in the rasagiline arm (adjunct studies), none in the placebo arm. Clinical trial data further \nsuggest that orthostatic hypotension occurs most frequently in the first two months of rasagiline \ntreatment and tends to decrease over time. \n \nHypertension \nRasagiline selectively inhibits MAO-B and is not associated with increased tyramine sensitivity at the \nindicated dose (1 mg/day). In blinded placebo-controlled studies (monotherapy and adjunct) severe \nhypertension was not reported in any subjects in the rasagiline arm. In the post-marketing period, \ncases of elevated blood pressure, including rare serious cases of hypertensive crisis associated with \ningestion of unknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods, have been reported in patients taking \nrasagiline. In post-marketing period, there was one case of elevated blood pressure in a patient using \nthe ophthalmic vasoconstrictor tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride while taking rasagiline. \n \nImpulse control disorders \nOne case of hypersexuality was reported in monotherapy placebo-controlled study. The following \nwere reported during post-marketing exposure with unknown frequency: compulsions, compulsive \nshopping, dermatillomania, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, impulse-control disorder, impulsive \nbehaviour, kleptomania, theft, obsessive thoughts, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stereotypy, \ngambling, pathological gambling, libido increased, hypersexuality, psychosexual disorder, sexually \ninappropriate behaviour. Half of the reported ICD cases were assessed as serious. Only single cases of \nreported cases had not recovered at the time they were reported. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sudden sleep onset (SOS) episodes \nExcessive daily sleepiness (hypersomnia, lethargy, sedation, sleep attacks, somnolence, sudden onset \nof sleep) can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments. A \nsimilar pattern of excessive daily sleepiness has been reported post-marketing with rasagiline. \nCases of patients, treated with rasagiline and other dopaminergic medicinal products, falling asleep \nwhile engaged in activities of daily living have been reported. Although many of these patients \nreported somnolence while on rasagiline with other dopaminergic medicinal products, some perceived \nthat they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert \nimmediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1-year after \ninitiation of treatment. \n \nHallucinations \nParkinson\u2019s disease is associated with symptoms of hallucinations and confusion. In post-marketing \nexperience, these symptoms have also been observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients treated with \nrasagiline. \n \nSerotonin syndrome \nRasagiline clinical trials did not allow concomitant use of fluoxetine or fluvoxamine with rasagiline, \nbut the following antidepressants and doses were allowed in the rasagiline trials: amitriptyline \n\u2264 50 mg/daily, trazodone \u2264 100 mg/daily, citalopram \u2264 20 mg/daily, sertraline \u2264 100 mg/daily, and \nparoxetine \u2264 30 mg/daily (see section 4.5). \n \nIn the post-marketing period, cases of potentially life-threating serotonin syndrome associated with \nagitation, confusion, rigidity, pyrexia and myoclonus have been reported by patients treated with \nantidepressants, meperidine, tramadol, methadone, or propoxyphene concomitantly with rasagiline. \n \nMalignant melanoma \nIncidence of skin melanoma in placebo-controlled clinical studies was 2/380 (0.5%) in rasagiline 1 mg \nas adjacent to levodopa therapy group vs. 1/388 (0.3%) incidence in placebo group. Additional cases \nof malignant melanoma were reported during post-marketing period. These cases were considered \nserious in all reports. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose  \n \nSymptoms \n \nSymptoms reported following overdose of rasagiline in doses ranging from 3 mg to 100 mg included \nhypomania, hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. \n \nOverdose can be associated with significant inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B. In a single-dose \nstudy healthy volunteers received 20 mg/day and in a ten-day study healthy volunteers received \n10 mg/day. Adverse reactions were mild or moderate and not related to rasagiline treatment. In a dose \nescalation study in patients on chronic levodopa therapy treated with 10 mg/day of rasagiline, there \nwere reports of cardiovascular adverse reactions (including hypertension and postural hypotension) \nwhich resolved following treatment discontinuation. These symptoms may resemble those observed \nwith non-selective MAO inhibitors. \n \nManagement \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nThere is no specific antidote. In case of overdose, patients should be monitored and the appropriate \nsymptomatic and supportive therapy instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson-Drugs, monoamine oxidase -B inhibitors, ATC code: \nN04BD02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRasagiline was shown to be a potent, irreversible MAO-B selective inhibitor, which may cause an \nincrease in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and \nsubsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in \nmodels of dopaminergic motor dysfunction. \n \n1-Aminoindan is an active major metabolite and it is not a MAO-B inhibitor.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of rasagiline was established in three studies: as monotherapy treatment in study I and as \nadjunct therapy to levodopa in the studies II and III. \n \nMonotherapy \nIn study I, 404 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (138 patients), rasagiline 1 mg/day \n(134 patients) or rasagiline 2 mg/day (132 patients) and were treated for 26 weeks, there was no active \ncomparator. \nIn this study, the primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline in the total score of the \nUnified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, parts I-III). The difference between the mean \nchange from baseline to week 26/termination (LOCF, Last Observation Carried Forward) was \nstatistically significant (UPDRS, parts I-III: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -4.2, 95% CI  \n[-5.7, -2.7]; p<0.0001; for rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -3.6, 95% CI [-5.0, -2.1]; p<0.0001, \nUPDRS Motor, part II: for rasagiline 1 mg compared to placebo -2.7, 95% CI [-3.87, -1.55], p<0.0001; \nfor rasagiline 2 mg compared to placebo -1.68, 95% CI [-2.85, -0.51], p=0.0050). The effect was \nevident, although its magnitude was modest in this patient population with mild disease. There was a \nsignificant and beneficial effect in quality of life (as assessed by PD-QUALIF scale). \n \nAdjunct therapy \nIn study II, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (229 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day \n(231 patients) or the catechol-O\u2013methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, entacapone, 200 mg taken \nalong with scheduled doses of levodopa (LD)/decarboxylase inhibitor (227 patients), and were treated \nfor 18 weeks. In study III, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (159 patients), \nrasagiline 0.5 mg/day (164 patients), or rasagiline 1 mg/day (149 patients), and were treated for \n26 weeks.  \nIn both studies, the primary measure of efficacy was the change from baseline to treatment period in \nthe mean number of hours that were spent in the \u201cOFF\u201d state during the day (determined from \n\u201c24-hour\u201d home diaries completed for 3 days prior to each of the assessment visits). \n \nIn study II, the mean difference in the number of hours spent in the \u201cOFF\u201d state compared to placebo \nwas -0.78h, 95% CI [-1.18, -0.39], p=0.0001. The mean total daily decrease in the OFF time was \nsimilar in the entacapone group (-0.80h, 95% CI [-1.20, -0.41], p<0.0001) to that observed in the \nrasagiline 1 mg group. In study III, the mean difference compared to placebo was -0.94h, 95% CI \n[-1.36, -0.51], p<0.0001. There was also a statistically significant improvement over placebo with the \nrasagiline 0.5 mg group, yet the magnitude of improvement was lower. The robustness of the results \n\njavascript:defwindow('primary')\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nfor the primary efficacy endpoint, was confirmed in a battery of additional statistical models and was \ndemonstrated in three cohorts (ITT, per protocol and completers). \nThe secondary measures of efficacy included global assessments of improvement by the examiner, \nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) subscale scores when OFF and UPDRS motor while ON. Rasagiline \nproduced statistically significant benefit compared to placebo.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nRasagiline is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in approximately 0.5 hours. \nThe absolute bioavailability of a single rasagiline dose is about 36%.  \nFood does not affect the Tmax of rasagiline, although Cmax and exposure (AUC) are decreased by \napproximately 60% and 20%, respectively, when the medicinal product is taken with a high fat meal. \nBecause AUC is not substantially affected, rasagiline can be administered with or without food. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean volume of distribution following a single intravenous dose of rasagiline is 243 l. Plasma \nprotein binding following a single oral dose of 14C-labelled rasagiline is approximately 60 to 70%. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRasagiline undergoes almost complete biotransformation in the liver prior to excretion. The \nmetabolism of rasagiline proceeds through two main pathways: N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation \nto yield: 1-aminoindan, 3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1 aminoindan and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan. In vitro \nexperiments indicate that both routes of rasagiline metabolism are dependent on cytochrome P450 \nsystem, with CYP1A2 being the major iso-enzyme involved in rasagiline metabolism. Conjugation of \nrasagiline and its metabolites was also found to be a major elimination pathway to yield glucuronides. \nEx vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that rasagiline is neither inhibitor nor inducer of major \nCYP450 enzymes (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \n \nAfter oral administration of 14C-labelled rasagiline, elimination occurred primarily via urine (62.6%) \nand secondarily via faeces (21.8%), with a total recovery of 84.4% of the dose over a period of \n38 days. Less than 1% of rasagiline is excreted as unchanged product in urine. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nRasagiline pharmacokinetics is linear with dose over the range of 0.5-2 mg in Parkinson\u2019s disease \npatients. Its terminal half-life is 0.6-2 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn subjects with mild hepatic impairment, AUC and Cmax were increased by 80% and 38%, \nrespectively. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, AUC and Cmax were increased by 568% \nand 83%, respectively (see section 4.4).  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nRasagiline's pharmacokinetics characteristics in subjects with mild (CLcr 50-80 ml/min) and moderate \n(CLcr 30-49 ml/min) renal impairment were similar to healthy subjects. \n \nElderly \n \nAge has little influence on rasagiline pharmacokinetics in the elderly (> 65 years) (see section 4.2) \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on the standard studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproduction and development. \n \nRasagiline did not present genotoxic potential in vivo and in several in vitro systems using bacteria or \nhepatocytes.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nAZILECT 1 mg tablets \n\nrasagiline \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What AZILECT is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take AZILECT \n3. How to take AZILECT \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store AZILECT \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What AZILECT is and what it is used for \n \nAZILECT contains the active substance rasagiline and it is used for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease in adults. It can be used together with or without Levodopa (another medicine that is used to \ntreat Parkinson\u2019s disease). \n \nWith Parkinson\u2019s disease, there is a loss of cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a \nchemical in the brain involved in movement control. AZILECT helps to increase and sustain levels of \ndopamine in the brain. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take AZILECT \n \nDo not take AZILECT \n- If you are allergic to rasagiline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have severe liver problems.  \n \nDo not take the following medicines while taking AZILECT: \n- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (e.g. for treatment of depression or Parkinson\u2019s disease, \n\nor used for any other indication), including medicinal and natural products without prescription \ne.g. St. John's Wort. \n\n- Pethidine (a strong pain killer). \nYou must wait at least 14 days after stopping AZILECT treatment and starting treatment with MAO \ninhibitors or pethidine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking AZILECT \n- If you have any liver problems \n- You should speak with your doctor about any suspicious skin changes. \n \nTell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing unusual behaviours where \nyou cannot resist the impulse, urges or cravings to carry out certain harmful or detrimental activities to \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nyourself or others. These are called impulse control disorders. In patients taking AZILECT and/or \nother medicines used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, behaviours such as compulsions, obsessive \nthoughts, addictive gambling, excessive spending, impulsive behaviour and an abnormally high sex \ndrive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings have been observed. Your doctor may need to adjust \nor stop your dose (see section 4). \n \nAZILECT may cause drowsiness and may cause you to suddenly fall asleep during day \ntime activities, especially if you are taking other dopaminergic medicinal products (used \nfor the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease). For further information please refer to section \ndriving and using machines. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no relevant use of AZILECT in children and adolescents. Therefore, AZILECT is not \nrecommended for use under the age of 18. \n \nOther medicines and AZILECT \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nEspecially tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- Certain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-\n\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants)  \n- The antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections \n- The cough suppressant dextromethorphan \n- Sympathomimetics such as those present in eye drops, nasal and oral decongestants and cold \n\nmedicine containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine \nThe use of AZILECT together with the antidepressants containing fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should \nbe avoided. \nIf you are starting treatment with AZILECT, you should wait at least 5 weeks after stopping fluoxetine \ntreatment. \nIf you are starting treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, you should wait at least 14 days after \nstopping AZILECT treatment. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are smoking or intend to stop smoking. Smoking could decrease \nthe amount of AZILECT in the blood. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  \n \nYou should avoid taking AZILECT if you are pregnant, as the effects of AZILECT on pregnancy and \nthe unborn child are not known. \n \nDriving and using machines \nAsk your doctor for advice before you drive and operate machines, since Parkinson\u2019s disease itself as \nwell as the treatment with AZILECT may influence your ability to do so. AZILECT can make you feel \ndizzy or drowsy; it can also cause episodes of sudden sleep onset. \nThis might be enhanced if you take other medicines to treat the symptoms of your Parkinson\u2019s disease, \nor if you take medicines which can make you feel drowsy, or if you drink alcohol while taking \nAZILECT. If you have experienced somnolence and/or episodes of sudden sleep onset before, or \nwhile taking AZILECT do not drive or operate machinery (see section 2). \n \n \n3. How to take AZILECT \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n \nThe recommended dose of AZILECT is 1 tablet of 1 mg taken by mouth once daily. AZILECT may \nbe taken with or without food.  \n \nIf you take more AZILECT than you should \nIf you think that you may have taken too many AZILECT tablets, contact your doctor or pharmacist \nimmediately. Take the AZILECT carton/ blister or bottle with you to show the doctor or pharmacist. \n \nSymptoms reported following overdose of AZILECT included slightly euphoric mood (light form of \nmania), extremely high blood pressure and serotonin syndrome (see section 4). \n \nIf you forget to take AZILECT \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take the next dose normally, when it is \ntime to take it. \n \nIf you stop taking AZILECT \nDo not stop taking AZILECT without first talking to your doctor.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nContact you doctor right away if you notice any of the following symptoms. You may need urgent \nmedical advice or treatment: \n\n- If you develop unusual behaviours such as compulsions, obsessive thoughts, addictive \ngambling, excessive shopping or spending, impulsive behaviour and an abnormally high sex \ndrive or an increase in sexual thoughts (impulse control disorders) (see section 2). \n\n- If you see or hear things which are not there (hallucinations). \n- Any combination of hallucinations, fever, restlessness, tremor and sweating (serotonin \n\nsyndrome) \n- If you notice any suspicious skin changes because there is a higher risk of skin cancer (not \n\nexclusively melanoma) in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (see section 2). \n \nOther side effects \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- Involuntary movements (dyskinesia) \n- Headache \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- Abdominal pain \n- Fall \n- Allergy \n- Fever \n- Flu (influenza) \n- General feeling of being unwell (malaise) \n- Neck pain \n- Chest pain (angina pectoris) \n- Low blood pressure when rising to a standing position with symptoms like dizziness/light-\n\nheadedness (orthostatic hypotension) \n- Decreased appetite  \n- Constipation \n- Dry mouth \n- Nausea and vomiting \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\n- Flatulence \n- Abnormal results of blood tests (leucopenia) \n- Joint pain (arthralgia) \n- Musculoskeletal pain \n- Joint inflammation (arthritis) \n- Numbness and muscle weakness of the hand (carpal tunnel syndrome) \n- Decreased weight  \n- Abnormal dreams \n- Difficulty in muscular coordination (balance disorder) \n- Depression \n- Dizziness (vertigo) \n- Prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia) \n- Runny nose (rhinitis) \n- Irritation of the skin (dermatitis)  \n- Rash \n- Bloodshot eyes (conjunctivitis) \n- Urinary urgency \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n- Stroke (cerebrovascular accident) \n- Heart attack (myocardial infarction) \n- Blistering rash (vesiculobullous rash) \n \nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data  \n- Elevated blood pressure \n- Excessive drowsiness \n- Sudden onset of sleep \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have severe liver problems. do not take the following medicines while taking azilect: - monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors (e.g. for treatment of depression or parkinson's disease, or used for any other indication), including medicinal and natural products without prescription e.g. st. john's wort. - pethidine (a strong pain killer). you must wait at least 14 days after stopping azilect treatment and starting treatment with mao inhibitors or pethidine. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking azilect - if you have any liver problems - you should speak with your doctor about any suspicious skin changes. tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices that you are developing unusual behaviours where you cannot resist the impulse, urges or cravings to carry out certain harmful or detrimental activities to 27 yourself or others. these are called impulse control disorders. in patients taking azilect and/or other medicines used to treat parkinson's disease, behaviours such as compulsions, obsessive thoughts, addictive gambling, excessive spending, impulsive behaviour and an abnormally high sex drive or an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings have been observed. your doctor may need to adjust or stop your dose (see section 4). azilect may cause drowsiness and may cause you to suddenly fall asleep during day time activities, especially if you are taking other dopaminergic medicinal products (used for the treatment of parkinson's disease). for further information please refer to section driving and using machines. children and adolescents there is no relevant use of azilect in children and adolescents. therefore, azilect is not recommended for use under the age of 18. other medicines and azilect tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. especially tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - certain antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants) - the antibiotic ciprofloxacin used against infections - the cough suppressant dextromethorphan - sympathomimetics such as those present in eye drops, nasal and oral decongestants and cold medicine containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine the use of azilect together with the antidepressants containing fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided. if you are starting treatment with azilect, you should wait at least 5 weeks after stopping fluoxetine treatment. if you are starting treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, you should wait at least 14 days after stopping azilect treatment. tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are smoking or intend to stop smoking. smoking could decrease the amount of azilect in the blood. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. you should avoid taking azilect if you are pregnant, as the effects of azilect on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. driving and using machines ask your doctor for advice before you drive and operate machines, since parkinson's disease itself as well as the treatment with azilect may influence your ability to do so. azilect can make you feel dizzy or drowsy; it can also cause episodes of sudden sleep onset. this might be enhanced if you take other medicines to treat the symptoms of your parkinson's disease, or if you take medicines which can make you feel drowsy, or if you drink alcohol while taking azilect. if you have experienced somnolence and/or episodes of sudden sleep onset before, or while taking azilect do not drive or operate machinery (see section 2).", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "azilect", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
