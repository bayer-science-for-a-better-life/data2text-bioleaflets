This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOxlumo 94.5 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of solution contains lumasiran sodium equivalent to 189 mg lumasiran. \n \nEach vial contains 94.5 mg lumasiran in 0.5 mL. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless to yellow solution (pH of approximately 7; osmolality 210 to 390 mOsm/kg). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOxlumo is indicated for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of \nhyperoxaluria. \n \nPosology  \n \nOxlumo is administered by subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose of Oxlumo consists of \nloading doses given once a month for 3 months, followed by maintenance doses, as shown in Table 1. \nDosing is based on body weight. \n \nThe patient dose (in mg) and volume (in mL) should be calculated as follows: \n \nPatient body weight (kg) × dose (mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of medicinal product to be administered. \n \nTotal amount (mg) divided by concentration (189 mg/mL) = total volume of medicinal product (mL) \nto be injected. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTable 1: Oxlumo weight-based dosing regimen \n\nBody weight Loading dose Maintenance dose \n\n(the maintenance dose should begin \none month after the last loading dose) \n\nless than 10 kg 6 mg/kg once monthly for \n3 months \n\n3 mg/kg once monthly \n\n10 kg to less than 20 kg 6 mg/kg once monthly for \n3 months \n\n6 mg/kg once every 3 months \n(quarterly) \n\n20 kg and above 3 mg/kg once monthly for \n3 months \n\n3 mg/kg once every 3 months \n(quarterly) \n\n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is delayed or missed, treatment should be administered as soon as possible. Prescribed \nmonthly or quarterly dosing should be resumed from the most recently administered dose. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nOxlumo has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is necessary in \npatients with transient elevation in total bilirubin (total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5×ULN). Caution is \nrequired when treating patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \n60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment (see \nsection 5.2). Limited clinical data are available in patients with severe renal impairment \n(eGFR 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2), or who are \non dialysis. Safety monitoring is warranted when treating patients with severe or end-stage renal \nimpairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nIn patients under 1 year of age, limited data are available. Caution should be used when treating these \npatients (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor subcutaneous use only. \n \nThis medicinal product is provided as a ready-to-use solution in a single use vial. \n\n \n• The required volume of Oxlumo should be calculated based on the recommended weight-based \n\ndose as shown in Table 1. \n• If the dose is more than 0.5 mL (94.5 mg), more than one vial will be needed. \n• The maximum acceptable single injection volume is 1.5 mL. Doses requiring more than 1.5 mL \n\nshould be administered as multiple injections (the total dose divided equally between syringes \nwith each injection containing approximately the same volume) to minimise potential injection \nsite discomfort due to injection volume. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• Having the medicinal product on the needle tip before the needle is in the subcutaneous space \nshould be avoided. \n\n• This medicinal product should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arms, or \nthighs. \n\n• For subsequent injections or doses, rotating the injection site is recommended. \n• This medicinal product should not be administered into scar tissue or areas that are reddened, \n\ninflamed, or swollen. \n \nOxlumo should be administered by a healthcare professional. For instructions on the medicinal \nproduct before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSevere or end-stage renal impairment  \n \nTreatment with lumasiran increases plasma glycolate levels, which may increase the risk of metabolic \nacidosis or worsening of pre-existing metabolic acidosis in patients with severe or end-stage renal \ndisease. These patients should therefore be monitored for signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis.    \n \nModerate or severe hepatic impairment  \n \nIn patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment there is a potential for decreased efficacy. \nTherefore, efficacy should be monitored in these patients (see section 5.2).  \n \nExcipient (sodium content)  \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinical drug interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2). \n \nConcomitant use with pyridoxine  \n \nConcomitant use of pyridoxine did not meaningfully influence the pharmacodynamics or \npharmacokinetics of lumasiran. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no data from the use of lumasiran in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of this \nmedicinal product could be considered during pregnancy taking into account the expected health \nbenefit for the woman and potential risks to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether lumasiran is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \nfrom Oxlumo therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nFertility  \n \nThere are no data on the effects of lumasiran on human fertility. No impact on male or female fertility \nwas detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOxlumo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most common adverse reaction reported was injection site reaction (32%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nAdverse reactions associated with lumasiran obtained from clinical studies are tabulated below. The \nadverse reactions are coded to preferred terms (PTs) under the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) \nand are presented by frequency. The frequency of the adverse reactions is expressed according to the \nfollowing categories: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal paina Very common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactionb Very common \n\na Includes abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower, abdominal discomfort, and \nabdominal tenderness. \n\nb Includes injection site reaction, injection site erythema, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, \ninjection site swelling, injection site discomfort, injection site discolouration, injection site mass, \ninjection site induration, injection site rash, injection site bruising, injection site haematoma and \ninjection site exfoliation. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn placebo-controlled and open-label clinical studies, injection site reactions were reported in 26 of \n81 patients (32.1%), occurring in 10% of injections. The most commonly reported symptoms were \nerythema, pain, pruritus, and swelling. The majority of injection site reactions started on the day of \nadministration, with 7 of the patients having injection site reactions that started 5 or more days after \nadministration (occurred in 1.6% of injections). Injection site reactions were generally mild, resolved \nwithin two days, and did not result in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. \n \nAbdominal pain \nIn the placebo-controlled study, abdominal pain was reported in 1 of 13 (7.7%) placebo-treated \npatients and 4 of 26 (15.4%) lumasiran-treated patients. In the placebo-controlled and open-label \nclinical studies, 17 of 81 patients (21.0%) reported abdominal pain, including upper or lower \nabdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, or abdominal tenderness. Most of the events have been mild, \ntransient and resolved without treatment. None have resulted in discontinuation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nImmunogenicity  \nIn patients with PH1 and healthy volunteers dosed with Oxlumo, 6 of 100 (6.0%) individuals tested \npositive for anti-drug-antibodies (ADA). ADA titres were low and generally transient, with no impact \non the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic profiles of the medicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe safety profile of lumasiran was similar in paediatric (aged 4 months to 17 years) and adult patients \nwith PH1. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored as medically indicated for any \nsigns or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned. \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nLumasiran is a double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that reduces levels of \nglycolate oxidase (GO) enzyme by targeting the hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) gene messenger \nribonucleic acid (mRNA) in hepatocytes through RNA interference. Decreased GO enzyme levels \nreduce the amount of available glyoxylate, a substrate for oxalate production. This results in reduction \nof urinary and plasma oxalate levels, the underlying cause of disease manifestations in patients with \nPH1. As the GO enzyme is upstream of the deficient alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) \nenzyme that causes PH1, the mechanism of action of lumasiran is independent of the underlying \nAGXT gene mutation. \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nThe efficacy of lumasiran was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study \nin patients 6 years and older with PH1 (ILLUMINATE-A) and in a single-arm clinical study in \npatients less than 6 years of age with PH1 (ILLUMINATE-B).  \n \nILLUMINATE-A \nA total of 39 patients with PH1 were randomised 2:1 to receive subcutaneous doses of lumasiran or \nplacebo during the 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period. Patients 6 years and older with \nan estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled, and received \n3 loading doses of 3 mg/kg lumasiran or placebo administered once monthly, followed by quarterly \nmaintenance doses of 3 mg/kg lumasiran or placebo (see section 4.2). After the 6-month double-blind \ntreatment period, patients, including those originally assigned to placebo, entered an extension period \nwith administration of lumasiran. \n \nDuring the 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period, 26 patients received lumasiran, and \n13 received placebo. The median age of patients at first dose was 14.9 years (range 6.1 to 61.0 years), \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n66.7% were male, and 76.9% were white. The median 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion corrected for \nbody surface area (BSA) at baseline was 1.72 mmol/24 h/1.73 m2, the median spot urinary \noxalate: creatinine ratio at baseline was 0.21 mmol/mmol, and the median plasma oxalate level at \nbaseline was 13.1 µmol/L. Overall, 33.3% of patients had normal renal function (eGFR \n≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), 48.7% had mild renal impairment (eGFR of 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), and \n18% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR of 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Of the patients enrolled in \nthe study, 84.6% reported a history of symptomatic renal stone events and 53.8% reported a history of \nnephrocalcinosis at baseline. The treatment arms were balanced at baseline with respect to age, urinary \noxalate level, and eGFR. \n \nThe primary endpoint was the percent reduction from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion \ncorrected for BSA averaged over months 3 through 6. Lumasiran was associated with a statistically \nsignificant reduction of 65.4% in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA, as compared to 11.8% in \nthe placebo group, representing a difference of 53.5% (95% CI: 44.8, 62.3; p<0.0001). Consistent with \nthe primary endpoint, a reduction of 60.5% was observed at month 6 in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine \nratio in the lumasiran arm compared to an 8.5% increase in the placebo arm. Furthermore, patients \ntreated with lumasiran had a rapid and sustained decrease in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for \nBSA, as shown in Figure 1. \n\nFigure 1: ILLUMINATE-A: Percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate \ncorrected for BSA by month \n\n \nAbbreviations: BL = baseline; BSA = body surface area; M = month; SEM = standard error of mean. \nResults are plotted as mean (±SEM) of percent change from baseline. \n \nAt month 6, a higher proportion of lumasiran-treated patients achieved normal or near-normal levels \nof 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA (≤1.5×ULN) compared to placebo-treated patients, as \nshown in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: ILLUMINATE-A: Secondary endpoint results over the 6-month double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled period \n\nEndpoints Lumasiran \n(N=26)  \n\nPlacebo  \n(N=13)  \n\nTreatment difference  \n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n\nProportion of patients with \n24-hour urinary oxalate \nlevels at or below ULN‡ \n\n0.5 (0.3, 0.7)§ 0 (0, 0.2)§ \n \n\n0.5 (0.2, 0.7)¶ 0.001# \n\nProportion of patients with \n24-hour urinary oxalate \n\n0.8 (0.6, 1.0)§ 0 (0, 0.2)§ 0.8 (0.5, 0.9)¶ <0.0001# \n\n\n\n8 \n\nEndpoints Lumasiran \n(N=26)  \n\nPlacebo  \n(N=13)  \n\nTreatment difference  \n(95% CI) \n\np-value \n\nlevels at or below \n1.5×ULN‡ \nPercent reduction in plasma \noxalate from baseline*Þ \n\n39.8 (2.9)† 0.3 (4.3)† 39.5 (28.9, 50.1) <0.0001 \n\nAbbreviations: ULN = upper limit of normal; SEM = Standard Error of Mean \nResults are based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. \n*The estimate based on the average of the least square mean of percent reduction at Months 3, 4, 5, \nand 6 using a mixed model for repeated measures. \n†LS Mean (SEM). \n‡ULN=0.514 mmol/24 hr/1.73 m2 for 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA. \n§95% CI based on Clopper Pearson Exact confidence interval. \n¶Calculated using the Newcombe Method based on the Wilson Score. \n#p-value is based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by baseline 24-hour urinary oxalate \ncorrected for BSA (≤1.70 vs >1.70 mmol/24 hr/1.73 m2). \nÞAnalysed in 23 lumasiran and 10 placebo patients who had baseline levels that allowed for reduction \nto occur. \n \nReduction in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA from baseline in patients with PH1 receiving \nlumasiran compared to placebo was similar across all pre-specified subgroups, including age, sex, \nrace, renal impairment, baseline pyridoxine (vitamin B6) use, and history of symptomatic renal stone \nevents (Figure 2). \n\nFigure 2: ILLUMINATE-A: Percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate \ncorrected for BSA, subgroup analysis \n\n \n \nReduced oxalate levels observed in the double-blind period were maintained through 12 months \nduring the extension period of study.    \n \neGFR and renal stone events (reported by events per 100 person-days) were assessed through the \ndouble-blind and extension periods for a total of 12 months. eGFR remained stable in patients \nadministered lumasiran. In the lumasiran arm, the rate of renal stone events reported 12 months prior \nto consent was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.08). The observed events during the double-blind period and the \nfirst 6 months of the extension period were 0.30 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.51) and 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.43), \nrespectively. In the placebo arm, the rate of renal stone events reported 12 months prior to consent was \n0.15 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.31) and the observed events during the double-blind period were \n0.18 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.48).  During the first 6 months of lumasiran treatment in the extension period a \nrate of 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.32) events were observed in patients previously receiving placebo. For \n\n\n\n9 \n\nnephrocalcinosis, data through the 6-month double-blind period are available. Of the 34 patients with \nbaseline and month 6 renal ultrasounds, 3 of 22 in the lumasiran group showed improvement in \nnephrocalcinosis, and 1 of 12 in the placebo group showed worsening in nephrocalcinosis. None of the \nother lumasiran (n=19) or placebo-treated (n=11) patients exhibited a change in nephrocalcinosis. \n \nILLUMINATE-B \nA total of 18 patients were enrolled and treated with lumasiran in an ongoing multi-center, single-arm \nstudy in patients with PH1 (ILLUMINATE-B). The study enrolled patients less than 6 years of age \nwith an eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients 12 months of age and older, and normal serum \ncreatinine in patients less than 12 months of age. In the 6-month primary analysis, at first dose, \n3 patients were less than 10 kg, 12 were 10 kg to less than 20 kg, and 3 were 20 kg and above. The \nmedian age of patients at first dose was 51.4 months (range 4.0 to 74.0 months), 55.6% were female, \nand 88.9% were white. The median spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio at baseline was \n0.47 mmol/mmol.  \n \nAt month 6, patients treated with lumasiran achieved a reduction of 72.0% (95% CI: 66.4, 77.5) in \nspot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio from baseline (averaged over months 3 through month 6), the \nprimary endpoint. Lumasiran was associated with rapid, and sustained reductions in spot urinary \noxalate: creatinine ratio (Figure 3), which were similar across all weight strata. The percent reduction \nin urinary oxalate excretion was consistent with data from ILLUMINATE-A. \n\nFigure 3: ILLUMINATE-B: Percent change in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio from \nbaseline by month \n\n \n \nNine patients achieved near normalisation (≤1.5×ULN), including 1 patient who achieved \nnormalisation (≤ULN), at month 6 in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio. \n \nFurthermore, from baseline to month 6 (average of month 3 to month 6), a mean plasma oxalate \nreduction of 31.7% (95% CI: 23.9, 39.5) was observed. During the 6-month period, the eGFR \nremained stable, and 2 post-baseline renal stone events in 2 patients were reported, compared to \n4 renal stone events in 3 patients in the 12-month period prior to consent. Fourteen of 18 patients had \nbaseline nephrocalcinosis. Renal ultrasound data at month 6 indicated improvement in 8 patients, \nincluding 3 with bilateral improvement. None of the 18 patients had new onset or worsening \nnephrocalcinosis. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOxlumo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hyperoxaluria (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption  \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration, lumasiran is rapidly absorbed with a median (range) time to \nreach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of 4.0 (0.5 to 12.0) hours. In children and adults with PH1 \n≥20 kg, the peak plasma concentration of lumasiran (Cmax) and area under the concentration curve \nfrom time zero to the last measurable concentration after dosing (AUC0-last) following the \nrecommended lumasiran dose of 3 mg/kg were 529 (205 to 1130) ng/mL and \n7400 (2890 to 10700) ng·h/mL, respectively. In children less than 20 kg, Cmax and AUC0-last of \nlumasiran following the recommended lumasiran dose of 6 mg/kg were 912 (523 to 1760) and \n7960 (5920 to 13300). Lumasiran concentrations were measurable, up to 24 to 48 hours post-dose. \n \nDistribution  \n \nIn healthy adult plasma samples, the protein binding of lumasiran is moderate to high (77 to 85%) at \nclinically relevant concentrations. For an adult patient with PH1, the population estimate for the \napparent central volume of distribution (Vd/F) for lumasiran is 4.9 L. Lumasiran primarily distributes to \nthe liver after subcutaneous dosing. \n \nBiotransformation  \n \nLumasiran is metabolised by endo- and exonucleases to oligonucleotides of shorter lengths. In vitro \nstudies indicate that lumasiran does not undergo metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. \n \nElimination  \n \nLumasiran is primarily eliminated from plasma by hepatic uptake, with only 7 to 26% of the \nadministered dose recovered in urine as lumasiran in the pooled data from healthy adult subjects and \npatients with PH1 >6 years of age. The mean (%CV) terminal plasma half-life of lumasiran is \n5.2 (47.0%) hours. The population estimate for apparent plasma clearance was 26.5 L/h for a typical \n70-kg adult. The mean renal clearance of lumasiran was minor and ranged from 2.0 to 3.4 L/h in \npaediatric and adult patients with PH1. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \n \nLumasiran exhibited linear to slightly nonlinear, time-independent pharmacokinetics in plasma \nfollowing single subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.3 to 6 mg/kg and multiple doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg \nonce monthly or 3 mg/kg quarterly. There was no accumulation of lumasiran in plasma after repeated \nonce monthly or quarterly dosing. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s)  \n \nPlasma concentrations of lumasiran do not reflect the extent or duration of the pharmacodynamic \nactivity of lumasiran. Rapid and targeted uptake of lumasiran by the liver results in rapid decline in \nplasma concentrations. In the liver, lumasiran exhibits a long half-life leading to maintenance of \npharmacodynamic effect over the monthly or quarterly dosing interval. \n \nInteractions  \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that lumasiran is not a substrate or an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) \nenzymes. Lumasiran is not expected to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes or modulate the activities of \ndrug transporters. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSpecial populations  \n \nElderly \nNo studies have been conducted in patients ≥65 years of age. Age was not a significant covariate in the \npharmacokinetics of lumasiran. \n \nGender and race \nIn clinical studies, there was no difference in the plasma exposure or pharmacodynamics of lumasiran \nbased on gender or race. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Limited \npharmacokinetic data in patients with mild and transient elevations in total bilirubin (total \nbilirubin >1.0 to 1.5×ULN) showed comparable plasma exposure of lumasiran and similar \npharmacodynamics as patients with normal hepatic function. Published literature show lower \nexpression of the asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver, i.e. the receptors responsible for lumasiran \nuptake, in patients with hepatic impairment. Nonclinical data suggest that this may not influence liver \nuptake or pharmacodynamics at therapeutic doses. The clinical relevance of these data is unknown. \n \nRenal impairment \nPatients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) had comparable plasma \nexposure of lumasiran and similar pharmacodynamics as patients with normal renal function (eGFR \n≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) \nCmax was similar to that in patients with normal renal function; AUC was 25% higher based on limited \ndata. Limited clinical data are available in patients with severe renal impairment \n(eGFR 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2), or who are \non dialysis (see section 4.2). For ESRD patients on dialysis, within the same body weight category, a \ntransient 3- to 7-fold higher Cmax and 2- to 3.5-fold AUC0-last increase was observed (see section 5.2 \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s)). However, plasma concentrations decline below \nthe level of detection within 24 to 48 hours, similar to patients without renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population  \nData in children younger than 1 year of age are limited. In children <20 kg, lumasiran Cmax was 2-fold \nhigher due to the nominally higher 6-mg/kg dose and faster absorption rate. The pharmacodynamics of \nlumasiran were comparable in paediatric patients (aged 4 months to 17 years) and in adults, despite the \ntransiently higher plasma concentrations in children <20 kg, due to the rapid and predominant \ndistribution of lumasiran to the liver. \n \nBody weight \nThe recommended dosing regimens yielded up to 2-fold higher Cmax in children <20 kg while AUC \nwas similar across the body weights studied (6.2 to 110 kg). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and genotoxicity. \n \nIn rats, but not in monkeys, microscopic changes in the liver (e.g. hepatocellular vacuolation, mitosis \nand karyomegaly) were observed, accompanied by decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels and other \nlaboratory changes. The reason for the apparent rodent-specificity is not understood and the relevance \nfor humans is unclear. \n \nLumasiran did not show any adverse effects on male and female fertility and pre- and post-natal \ndevelopment in rats. In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, skeletal abnormalities \nwere observed, but at high exposure multiples relative to human therapeutic exposures. The NOAELs \nwere approximately 20- to 70-times higher (based on monthly exposures). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nA dose-range finding toxicity study in neonate rats did not show increased sensitivity of the \ndeveloping rat to either the toxicology or pharmacology of lumasiran at exposure multiples of 2 \ncompared to human therapeutic exposures (based on monthly exposures). \n \nAnimal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of lumasiran. \n \n \n 6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nOxlumo 94.5 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection \nlumasiran \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Oxlumo is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Oxlumo \n3. How Oxlumo is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Oxlumo \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Oxlumo is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat Oxlumo is \nOxlumo contains the active substance lumasiran. \n \nWhat Oxlumo is used for \nOxlumo is used to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in adults and children of all ages. \n \nWhat PH1 is \nPH1 is a rare illness in which the liver produces too much of a substance called oxalate. Your kidneys \nremove oxalate from the body and it is passed out in the urine. In people with PH1, the extra oxalate \ncan build up in the kidneys and cause kidney stones, and can stop the kidney from working as well as \nthey should. A build-up of oxalate can also damage other parts of the body such as eyes, heart, skin, \nand bone. This is called oxalosis. \n \nHow Oxlumo works \nLumasiran, the active substance in Oxlumo, reduces the amount of an enzyme called glycolate oxidase \nthat the liver makes. Glycolate oxidase is one of the enzymes involved in producing oxalate. By \nlowering the amount of the enzyme, the liver produces less oxalate and the levels of oxalate in the \nurine and blood also fall. This can help to reduce the effects of the illness. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Oxlumo \n \n\nYou must not be given Oxlumo: \n• if you are severely allergic to lumasiran, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6).  \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before being given this medicine. \n \nYour doctor may monitor you for signs of metabolic acidosis (the build-up of acid in the body). \n \nOther medicines and Oxlumo \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \nnurse for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will decide whether you should take Oxlumo \nafter considering the expected health benefits for you as well as the risks to your unborn baby. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThis medicine may pass into breast milk and it could have an effect on your baby. If you are \nbreast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will help you \ndecide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop treatment.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nThis medicine is unlikely to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nOxlumo contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How Oxlumo is given \n \nHow much Oxlumo is given \nYour doctor will work out how much medicine to give you. The dose will depend on how much you \nweigh. Your doctor will adjust your dose as your weight changes. \n \nYou will receive your first doses (loading doses) once a month for 3 months. You will then start \nmaintenance dosing one month after the last loading dose. \n \n\nBody weight less than 10 kg  \n• Loading doses: 6 mg for every kg of your weight, given once a month for 3 months. \n• Maintenance dosing: 3 mg for every kg of your weight, given once every month. \n\n \nBody weight from 10 kg to less than 20 kg  \n\n• Loading doses: 6 mg for every kg of your weight, given once a month for 3 months. \n• Maintenance dosing: 6 mg for every kg of your weight, given once every 3 months. \n\n \nBody weight 20 kg or more  \n\n• Loading doses: 3 mg for every kg of your weight, given once a month for 3 months. \n• Maintenance dosing: 3 mg for every kg of your weight, given once every 3 months. \n\n \nHow Oxlumo is given \nThis medicine will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. \n• It is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) into your stomach area (abdomen), or \n\nin some cases, your upper arm or thigh. You will be given the injection in a different spot from \none injection to the next. \n\n• Depending on your dose, more than one subcutaneous injection may need to be given. \n• Your doctor or nurse will not inject into skin areas that are scarred, reddened, inflamed, or \n\nswollen. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIf you are given too much Oxlumo \nIn the unlikely event that your doctor or nurse gives you too much (an overdose) they will check you \nfor side effects. \n \nIf you miss your dose of Oxlumo \nIf you miss a dose of Oxlumo, talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible about when to get your \nnext dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects may occur when taking Oxlumo: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Redness, pain, itching, swelling, discomfort, colour changes, mass, induration, rash, bruising or \n\nexfoliation at the site of the injection (injection site reaction). \n• Stomach pain or discomfort (abdominal pain) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Oxlumo \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date, which is stated on the carton and vial after EXP. The \nexpiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nThis medicine is for single use only.

If the \n\ndose is more than 0.5 mL, you will need to use more than one vial. The maximum acceptable \nsingle injection volume to be administered is 1.5 mL. If more than 1.5 mL is needed, you may \nneed to give more than one subcutaneous injection. \n\n• To withdraw Oxlumo, hold the vial upright or tilt at a slight angle and ensure the flat edge of the \nneedle is pointed downwards. \n\n• Point the needle and syringe straight up and tap the syringe to move any bubbles to the top. Once \nthe bubbles are at the top, gently push the plunger to force the bubbles out of the syringe. Check to \nensure the correct amount of medicine is in the syringe. \n\n• Administer the medicine with a sterile 25- to 31-G needle with a 13-mm or 16-mm needle length \nfor subcutaneous injection. For volumes less than 0.3 mL, a sterile 0.3-mL syringe is \nrecommended. \n\n• Note: Do not push this medicine into the 25-G to 31-G needle. When using 0.3 mL (insulin) \nsyringes, do not force the bubble from syringe. \n\n• Injection can be into the abdomen, upper arms, or thighs. Consider rotating injection sites. Do not \nadminister into scar tissue or areas that are reddened, inflamed, or swollen. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu./\n\n\n27 \n\n• Note: When administering subcutaneous injections into the abdomen, avoid a 2.0-cm diameter \ncircle around the navel. \n\n• Clean the area of planned injection with an alcohol swab and wait for the area to dry completely. \n• Ensure proper injection technique. Do not inject into a vein or muscle. \n• Insert the needle at a right angle (90 degrees) to deliver the injection just below the skin. In \n\npatients with little subcutaneous tissue, the needle should be inserted at a 45-degree angle. \n• Do not press down on the plunger while piercing the skin. Once the needle is inserted through the \n\nskin, release the pinched skin and administer the dose in a slow and steady manner. Once the \nmedicine has been administered count for at least 5 seconds before withdrawing the needle from \nthe skin. Lightly press gauze or cotton ball on the injection site as needed. Do not put the needle \ncap back on. \n\n• Note: Do not aspirate after inserting the needle to prevent tissue damage, haematoma, and \nbruising. \n\n• If more than one injection is needed for a single dose of Oxlumo, the injection sites should be at \nleast 2 cm apart. \n\n• Only use the vial once. After administering the dose, dispose of any unused medicine in the vial \naccording to local regulations. \n\n• Use the syringes, transfer needles, and injection needles only once. Dispose of any used syringes \nand needles in accordance with local regulations. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.
