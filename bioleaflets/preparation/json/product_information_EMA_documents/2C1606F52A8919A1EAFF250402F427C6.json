PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOromucosal solution \nClear colourless solution \npH 2.9 to 3.7 \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents (from \n3 months to < 18 years). \n \nBUCCOLAM must only be used by parents/carers where the patient has been diagnosed to have \nepilepsy. \n \nFor infants between 3-6 months of age treatment should be in a hospital setting where monitoring is \npossible and resuscitation equipment is available. See section 4.2. \n \n\n2 \n\n\n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nStandard doses are indicated below:  \n \n\nAge range Dose Label colour \n\n3 to 6 months hospital \nsetting \n\n2.5 mg Yellow \n\n> 6 months to < 1 year 2.5 mg Yellow \n\n1 year to < 5 years 5 mg Blue \n\n5 years to < 10 years 7.5 mg Purple \n\n10 years to < 18 years 10 mg Orange \n \nCarers should only administer a single dose of midazolam. If the seizure has not stopped within 10 \nminutes after administration of midazolam, emergency medical assistance must be sought and the \nempty syringe given to the healthcare professional to provide information on the dose received by the \npatient. \n \nA second or repeat dose when seizures re-occur after an initial response should not be given without \nprior medical advice (see section 5.2). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required, however, BUCCOLAM should be used with caution in patients with \nchronic renal failure as elimination of midazolam may be delayed and the effects prolonged. (see \nsection 4.4) \n \nHepatic impairment \nHepatic impairment reduces the clearance of midazolam with a subsequent increase in terminal half-\nlife. Therefore, the clinical effects may be stronger and prolonged, hence careful monitoring of the \nclinical effects and vital signs is recommended following administration of midazolam in patients with \nhepatic impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nBUCCOLAM is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of midazolam in children aged 0 to 3 months has not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nBUCCOLAM is for oromucosal use. The full amount of solution should be inserted slowly into the \nspace between the gum and the cheek. Laryngo-tracheal insertion should be avoided to prevent \naccidental aspiration of the solution. If necessary (for larger volumes and/or smaller patients), \napproximately half the dose should be given slowly into one side of the mouth, then the other half \ngiven slowly into the other side.   \n \nFor detailed instructions on how to administer the medicinal product, see section 6.6.  \n \n\n3 \n\n\n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \n \nNo needle, intravenous tubing or any other device for parenteral administration should be attached to \nthe oral syringe. \n \nBUCCOLAM is not for intravenous use. \n \nThe oral syringe cap should be removed before use to avoid risk of choking. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, benzodiazepines or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1 \nMyasthenia gravis \nSevere respiratory insufficiency \nSleep apnoea syndrome \nSevere hepatic impairment \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRespiratory insufficiency \n \nMidazolam should be used with caution in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency because \nmidazolam may further depress respiration. \n \nPaediatric patients aged 3 to 6 months \n \nGiven the higher metabolite to parent drug ratio in younger children, a delayed respiratory depression \nas a result of high active metabolite concentrations in the 3-6 months age group cannot be excluded. \nTherefore, the use of BUCCOLAM in the 3-6 month age group should be limited for use only under \nthe supervision of a health care professional where resuscitation equipment is available and where \nrespiratory function can be monitored and equipment for respiratory assistance, if needed, is available.  \n \nAltered elimination of midazolam \n \nMidazolam should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure, impaired hepatic or \ncardiac function. Midazolam may accumulate in patients with chronic renal failure or impaired hepatic \nfunction whilst in patients with impaired cardiac function it may cause decreased clearance of \nmidazolam. \n \nConcomitant use with other benzodiazepines \n \nDebilitated patients are more prone to the central nervous system (CNS) effects of benzodiazepines \nand, therefore, lower doses may be required. \n \nMedical history of alcohol or drug abuse \n \nMidazolam should be avoided in patients with a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse. \n \nAmnesia \n \nMidazolam may cause anterograde amnesia. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMidazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 have the potential to \nrespectively increase and decrease the plasma concentrations and, subsequently, the effects of \n\n4 \n\n\n\n \n\nmidazolam thus requiring dose adjustments accordingly. Pharmacokinetic interactions with CYP3A4 \ninhibitors or inducers are more pronounced for oral as compared to oromucosal or parenteral \nmidazolam as CYP3A4 enzymes are also present in the upper gastro-intestinal tract. After oromucosal \nadministration, only systemic clearance will be affected. After a single dose of oromucosal \nmidazolam, the consequence on the maximal clinical effect due to CYP3A4 inhibition will be minor \nwhile the duration of effect may be prolonged. Hence, a careful monitoring of the clinical effects and \nvital signs is recommended during the use of midazolam with a CYP3A4 inhibitor even after a single \ndose. \n \nAnaesthetics and narcotic analgesics  \n \nFentanyl may reduce midazolam clearance. \n \nAntiepileptics  \n \nCo-administration with midazolam may cause enhanced sedation or respiratory or cardiovascular \ndepression.  Midazolam may interact with other hepatically metabolised medicinal products, e.g. \nphenytoin, causing potentiation. \n \nCalcium-channel blockers \n \nDiltiazem and verapamil have been shown to reduce the clearance of midazolam and other \nbenzodiazepines and may potentiate their actions. \n \nUlcer-healing medicinal products \n \nCimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole have been shown to reduce the clearance of midazolam and \nother benzodiazepines and may potentiate their actions. \n \nXanthines \n \nMetabolism of midazolam and other benzodiazepines is accelerated by xanthines. \n \nDopaminergic medicinal products \n \nMidazolam may cause inhibition of levodopa. \n \nMuscle relaxants \n \nE.g. baclofen. Midazolam may cause potentiation of muscle relaxants, with increased CNS depressant \neffects. \n \nNabilone \n \nCo-administration with midazolam may cause enhanced sedation or respiratory and cardiovascular \ndepression. \n \nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 \n \nMedicinal product interactions following oromucosal administration of midazolam are likely to be \nsimilar to those observed after intravenous midazolam rather than oral administration. \n \nFood \nGrapefruit juice reduces the clearance of midazolam and potentiates its action. \n \n\n5 \n\n\n\n \n\nAzole antifungals \nKetoconazole increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by 5-fold while the \nterminal half-life increased by about 3-fold. \n \nVoriconazole increased the exposure of intravenous midazolam by 3-fold whereas its elimination half-\nlife increased by about 3-fold. \n \nFluconazole and itraconazole both increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by 2 \nto 3-fold associated with an increase in terminal half-life by 2.4-fold for itraconazole and 1.5-fold for \nfluconazole. \n \nPosaconazole increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about 2-fold. \n \nMacrolide antibiotics \nErythromycin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about \n1.6 to 2 –fold associated with an increase of the terminal half-life of midazolam by 1.5 to 1.8-fold. \n \nClarithromycin increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by up to 2.5-fold \nassociated with an increase in terminal half-life by 1.5 to 2-fold. \n \nHIV Protease inhibitors \nCo-administration with protease inhibitors (e.g. Saquinavir and other HIV protease inhibitors) may \ncause a large increase in the concentration of midazolam. Upon co-administration with ritonavir-\nboosted lopinavir, the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam increased by 5.4-fold, \nassociated with a similar increase in terminal half-life. \n \nCalcium-channel blockers \nA single dose of diltiazem increased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about \n25% and the terminal half-life was prolonged by 43%. \n \nVarious medicinal products \nAtorvastatin showed a 1.4-fold increase in plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam compared \nto control group. \n \nMedicinal products that induce CYP3A4 \n \nRifampicin  \n7 days of 600 mg once daily decreased the plasma concentrations of intravenous midazolam by about \n60%. The terminal half-life decreased by about 50-60%. \n \nHerbs \nSt John’s Wort decreased plasma concentrations of midazolam by about 20-40% associated with a \ndecrease in terminal half life of about 15-17%.  Depending on the specific St John's Wort extract, the \nCYP3A4-inducing effect may vary. \n \nPharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) \n \nThe co-administration of midazolam with other sedative/hypnotic medicinal products and CNS \ndepressants, including alcohol, is likely to result in enhanced sedation and respiratory depression. \n \nExamples include opiate derivatives (used as analgesics, antitussives or substitutive treatments), \nantipsychotics, other benzodiazepines used as anxiolytics or hypnotics, barbiturates, propofol, \nketamine, etomidate; sedative antidepressants, non-recent H1-antihistamines and centrally acting \nantihypertensive medicinal products. \n \n\n6 \n\n\n\n \n\nAlcohol (including alcohol-containing medicinal products may markedly enhance the sedative effect \nof midazolam. Alcohol intake should be strongly avoided in case of midazolam administration (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMidazolam decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalation anaesthetics. \n \nThe effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors may be larger in infants since part of the oromucosal dose is \nprobably swallowed and absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of midazolam in pregnant women. Animal studies \ndo not indicate a teratogenic effect with respect to reproductive toxicity, but foetotoxicity has been \nobserved in humans as with other benzodiazepines. No data on exposed pregnancies are available for \nthe first two trimesters of pregnancy. \n \nThe administration of high doses of midazolam in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour has \nbeen reported to produce maternal or foetal adverse reactions (risk of aspiration of fluids and stomach \ncontents during labour in the mother, irregularities in the foetal heart rate, hypotonia, poor suckling, \nhypothermia and respiratory depression in the new-born infant). \n \nMidazolam may be used during pregnancy if clearly necessary. The risk for new-born infants should \nbe taken into account in the event of administration of midazolam in the third trimester of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nMidazolam is excreted in low quantities (0.6%) in human milk. As a result it may not be necessary to \nstop breast feeding following a single dose of midazolam. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not show an impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMidazolam has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nSedation, amnesia, impaired attention and impaired muscular function may adversely affect the ability \nto drive, ride a bicycle or use machines. After receiving midazolam, the patient should be warned not \nto drive a vehicle or operate a machine until completely recovered.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nPublished clinical studies show that oromucosal midazolam was administered to approx 443 children \nwith seizures. Respiratory depression occurs at a rate of up to 5%, although this is a known \ncomplication of convulsive seizures as well as being related to midazolam use. One episode of pruritus \nwas possibly attributed to the use of buccal midazolam. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table below lists the adverse reactions reported to occur when oromucosal midazolam was \nadministered to children in clinical studies.  \n \n\n7 \n\n\n\n \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions is classified as follows: \nCommon:  ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon:  ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nVery rare: < 1/10,000 \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:  \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency: Adverse Drug Reaction \nPsychiatric disorders Very rare: \n\nAggression**, agitation**, anger**, confusional state**, \neuphoric mood**, hallucination**, hostility**, movement \ndisorder**, physical assault** \n\nNervous system disorders \n \n\nCommon: \nSedation, somnolence, depressed levels of consciousness \nRespiratory depression \nVery rare: \nAnterograde amnesia**, ataxia**, dizziness**, headache**, \nseizure**, paradoxical reactions** \n\nCardiac disorders Very rare: \nBradycardia**, cardiac arrest**, hypotension**, \nvasodilatation** \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery rare: \nApnoea**, dyspnea**, laryngospasm**, respiratory arrest** \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Common: \nNausea and vomiting \nVery rare: \nConstipation**, dry mouth** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders  \n\nUncommon: \nPruritus, rash and urticarial \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nVery rare: \nFatigue**, hiccups** \n\n**These adverse reactions have been reported to occur when midazolam is injected in children and/or \nadults, which may be of relevance to oromucosal administration. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAn increased risk for falls and fractures has been recorded in elderly benzodiazepine users. \n \nLife-threatening incidents are more likely to occur in those with pre-existing respiratory insufficiency \nor impaired cardiac function, particularly when a high dosage is administered (see section 4.4).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nMidazolam overdose can present a threat to life if the patient has pre-existing respiratory or cardiac \ninsufficiency, or when combined with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). \n \nOverdose of benzodiazepines is usually manifested by degrees of central nervous system depression \nranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild cases, symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion and \n\n8 \n\n\n\n \n\nlethargy, in more serious cases, symptoms may include ataxia, hypotonia, hypotension, respiratory \ndepression, rarely coma and very rarely death. \n \nManagement \n \nIn the management of overdose with any medicinal product, it should be borne in mind that multiple \nagents may have been taken. \n \nFollowing overdose with oral midazolam, vomiting should be induced (within one hour) if the patient \nis conscious or gastric lavage undertaken with the airway protected if the patient is unconscious. If \nthere is no advantage in emptying the stomach, activated charcoal should be given to reduce \nabsorption. Special attention should be paid to respiratory and cardiovascular functions in intensive \ncare. \n \nFlumazenil may be useful as an antidote. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, benzodiazepine derivatives ATC code: N05CD08. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMidazolam is a derivative of the imidazobenzodiazepine group. The free base is a lipophilic substance \nwith low solubility in water. The basic nitrogen in position 2 of the imidazobenzodiazepine ring \nsystem enables midazolam to form the hydrochloride salt with acids. These produce a stable solution \nsuitable for oromucosal administration. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe pharmacological action of midazolam is characterized by short duration because of rapid \nmetabolic transformation. Midazolam has an anticonvulsant effect.  It also exerts a sedative and sleep-\ninducing effect of pronounced intensity, and an anxiolytic and a muscle-relaxant effect. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn 4 rectal diazepam controlled studies and one study versus intravenous diazepam, in a total of 688 \nchildren, cessation of visible signs of seizures within 10 minutes was observed in 65% to 78% of \nchildren receiving oromucosal midazolam. Additionally, in 2 of the studies, cessation of visible signs \nof seizures within 10 minutes without recurrence within 1 hour after administration was observed in \n56% to 70% of children. The frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions reported for \nOromucosal midazolam during published clinical trials were similar to the adverse drug reactions \nreported in the comparative group using rectal diazepam. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBUCCOLAM in the subset of the paediatric population < 3months old, on the grounds that the \nspecific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments \nfor these paediatric patients.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSimulated pharmacokinetic parameters for the recommended posology in children aged 3 months to \nless than 18 years, based on a population pharmacokinetic study are provided in tabulated format \nbelow: \n \n\n9 \n\n\n\n \n\nDose Age Parameter Mean SD \n\n2.5 mg 3 m  < 1 yr AUC0-inf  (ng.h/ml) 168 98 \nCmax (ng/ml) 104 46 \n\n5 mg 1 yr  < 5 yrs AUC0-inf  (ng.h/ml) 242 116 \nCmax (ng/ml) 148 62 \n\n7.5 mg 5 yrs  <10 yrs AUC0-inf  (ng.h/ml) 254 136 \nCmax (ng/ml) 140 60 \n\n10 mg 10  yrs < 18 yrs AUC0-inf  (ng.h/ml) 189 96 \nCmax (ng/ml) 87 44 \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter oromucosal administration midazolam is absorbed rapidly. Maximum plasma concentration is \nreached within 30 minutes in children. The absolute bioavailability of oromucosal midazolam is about \n75% in adults. The bioavailability of oromucosal midazolam has been estimated at 87% in children \nwith severe malaria and convulsions. \n \nDistribution \n \nMidazolam is highly lipophilic and distributes extensively. The steady state volume of distribution \nfollowing oromucosal administration is estimated to be 5.3 l/kg.  \n \nApproximately 96-98% of midazolam is bound to plasma proteins. The major fraction of plasma \nprotein binding is due to albumin. There is a slow and insignificant passage of midazolam into the \ncerebrospinal fluid. In humans, midazolam has been shown to cross the placenta slowly and to enter \nfoetal circulation. Small quantities of midazolam are found in human milk. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMidazolam is almost entirely eliminated by biotransformation.  The fraction of the dose extracted by \nthe liver has been estimated to be 30-60%.  Midazolam is hydroxylated by the cytochrome P4503A4 \nisozyme and the major urinary and plasma metabolite is alpha-hydroxy-midazolam.  Following \noromucosal administration in children the area under the curve ratio for alpha-hydroxy midazolam to \nmidazolam is 0.46.  \n \nIn a population pharmacokinetic study, the metabolite levels are shown to be higher in younger than \nolder paediatric patients and thus likely to be of more importance in children than in adults. \n \nElimination \n \nPlasma clearance of midazolam in children following oromucosal administration is 30 ml/kg/min. The \ninitial and terminal elimination half-lives are 27 and 204 minutes, respectively.  Midazolam is excreted \nmainly by the renal route (60-80% of the injected dose) and recovered as glucuroconjugated alpha-\nhydroxy-midazolam.  Less than 1% of the dose is recovered in urine as unchanged medicinal product.. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nObese \nThe mean half-life is greater in obese than in non-obese patients (5.9 versus 2.3 hours). This is due to \nan increase of approximately 50% in the volume of distribution corrected for total body weight. The \nclearance is not significantly different in obese and non-obese patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe elimination half-life in cirrhotic patients may be longer and the clearance lower as compared to \nthose in healthy volunteers (see section 4.4). \n \n\n10 \n\n\n\n \n\nRenal impairment \nThe elimination half-life in patients with chronic renal failure is similar to that in healthy \nvolunteers. \n \nThe elimination half-life of midazolam is prolonged up to six times in the critically ill. \n \nCardiac insufficiency \nThe elimination half-life is longer in patients with congestive heart failure compared with that in \nhealthy subjects (see section 4.4). \n \nExposure following a second dose in the same seizure episode \nSimulated exposure data show that the overall AUC approximately doubles when a second dose is \nadministered at 10, 30 and 60 minutes following the first dose. A second dose at 10 minutes results in \na significant increase in mean Cmax of between 1.7 to 1.9 fold. At 30 and 60 minutes, significant \nelimination of midazolam has already occurred and therefore the increase in mean Cmax is less \npronounced; 1.3 to 1.6 and 1.2 to 1.5 fold respectively. (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn a rat fertility study, animals dosed up to ten times the clinical dose, no adverse effects on fertility \nwere observed. \n \nThere are no other preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to that already \nincluded in other sections of the SmPC. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for your child. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as those of the child for whom this medicine has been \nprescribed. \n\n• If you see any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What BUCCOLAM is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you give BUCCOLAM \n3. How to give BUCCOLAM \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store BUCCOLAM \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What BUCCOLAM is and what it is used for \n \nBUCCOLAM contains a medicine called midazolam. Midazolam belongs to a group of medicines \nknown as benzodiazepines. BUCCOLAM is used to stop a sudden, prolonged, convulsive, seizure in \ninfants, toddlers, children and adolescents (from 3 months to less than 18 years of age). \n \nIn infants from 3 months to less than 6 months it should only be used in a hospital setting where \nmonitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available. \n \nThis medicine must only be used by parents/carers where the child has been diagnosed to have \nepilepsy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you give BUCCOLAM \n \nDo not give BUCCOLAM if the patient has: \n• An allergy to midazolam, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6) \n• A disease of the nerves and muscles causing muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis) \n• Severe difficulty breathing at rest (BUCCOLAM can make breathing difficulties worse) \n• An illness causing frequent interruption of breathing during sleep (sleep apnoea syndrome) \n• Severe liver problems. \n\n44 \n\n\n\n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving BUCCOLAM if the patient has: \n• A kidney, liver or heart condition \n• A lung condition that causes difficulty breathing on a regular basis. \n\n \nThis medicine may cause people to forget what happened after they have been given it. Patients should \nbe observed carefully after being given the medicine. \n \nThis medicine should be avoided in patients with a medical history of alcohol or drug abuse. \n \nLife threatening incidents are more likely in patients with breathing difficulties or heart problems, \nespecially when higher doses of BUCCOLAM are given.  \n \nChildren younger than 3 months: BUCCOLAM should not be given to children younger than 3 \nmonths since there is not enough information in this age group. \n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to the patient, talk to a doctor or pharmacist before \ngiving this medicine. \n \nOther medicines and BUCCOLAM \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if the patient is taking, or has recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. If you have any doubt about whether any medicine the patient is taking may affect the use \nof BUCCOLAM, please speak to your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nThis is extremely important, as using more than one medicine at the same time can strengthen or \nweaken the effect of the medicines involved.  \n \nThe effects of BUCCOLAM may be intensified by medicines such as: \n• antiepileptics, (for treating epilepsy) e.g. phenytoin \n• antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin  \n• antifungals, e.g. ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, pozaconazole  \n• anti-ulcer medicines, e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine and omeprazole  \n• medicines used to treat blood pressure, e.g. diltiazem, verapamil \n• some medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS, e.g. saquinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combination \n• narcotic analgesics (very strong pain killers), e.g. fentanyl  \n• medicines used to reduce fat in the blood, e.g. atorvastatin \n• medicines used to treat nausea, e.g. nabilone \n• hypnotics (sleep inducing medicines) \n• sedative antidepressants (medicines used to treat depression that make you sleepy) \n• sedatives (medicines that relax you) \n• anaesthetics (for pain relief) \n• antihistamines (to treat allergies). \n \nThe effects of BUCCOLAM may be reduced by medicines such as: \n• rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) \n• xanthines (used to treat asthma)  \n• St John’s Wort (a herbal medicine). This should be avoided in patients taking BUCCOLAM. \n \nBUCCOLAM may increase the effect of some muscle relaxants e.g. baclofen (causing increased \ndrowsiness). This medicine may also stop some other medicines from working as well, e.g. levodopa \n(used to treat Parkinson’s disease). \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist about medicines the patient should avoid whilst taking \nBUCCOLAM. \n \n\n45 \n\n\n\n \n\nBUCCOLAM with food and drink \nThe patient must not drink alcohol while taking BUCCOLAM. Alcohol may increase the sedative \neffects of this medicine and make them very sleepy. \n \nThe patient must not drink grapefruit juice while taking BUCCOLAM. Grapefruit juice may increase \nthe sedative effects of this medicine and make them very sleepy. \n \nPregnancy \nIf the patient who will be given this medicine is pregnant or breast-feeding, thinks she may be \npregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask a doctor for advice before taking this medicine.   \n \nGiving high doses of BUCCOLAM during the last 3 months of pregnancy can cause abnormal heart \nbeat in the unborn child. Babies born after this medicine is administered during childbirth can also \nhave poor suckling, breathing difficulties and poor muscle tone at birth. \n \nBreast-feeding  \nTell the doctor if the patient is breast-feeding. Even though small amounts of BUCCOLAM may pass \ninto breast milk, it may not be necessary to stop breast-feeding. The doctor will advise if the patient \nshould breast-feed after being given this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nBUCCOLAM may make the patient sleepy, forgetful or affect their concentration and co-ordination. \nThis may affect their performance at skilled tasks such as driving, riding a bicycle, or using machines. \n \nAfter receiving this medicine, the patient should not drive a vehicle, ride a bicycle or operate a \nmachine until they have completely recovered. Please discuss with your doctor if you need further \nadvice. \n \n \n3. How to give BUCCOLAM \n \nAlways give this medicine exactly as a doctor has told you. Check with a doctor or pharmacist if you \nare not sure. \n \nDosage \nYour doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose of BUCCOLAM your child needs, generally according \nto your child’s age. The different doses each have a different colour, which is shown on the carton, the \ntube and the syringe containing the medicine. \n \nDepending on age, your child will have received one of the following doses, in specifically colour \nlabelled packaging:  \n3 months to less than 1 year: 2.5 mg - yellow labelled packaging \n1 year to less than 5 years: 5 mg - blue labelled packaging \n5 years to less than 10 years: 7.5 mg - purple labelled packaging \n10 years to less than 18 years: 10 mg - orange labelled packaging \nThe dose is the full contents of one oral syringe. Do not give more than one dose. \n \nToddlers aged from 3 months to less than 6 months should only be treated in a hospital setting where \nmonitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available.  \n \nPreparing to give this medicine \nIf the child is having a seizure, allow their body to move freely, do not try to restrain them. Only move \nthem if they are in danger from, for example, deep water, fire or sharp objects. \n \nSupport your child’s head with something soft, such as a cushion or your lap. \n \nCheck that the medicine is the correct dose for your child, according to their age. \n\n46 \n\n\n\n \n\nHow to give this medicine \nAsk a doctor, pharmacist or nurse to show you how to take or administer this medicine. Always check \nwith them if you are not sure. \n \nThe information on how to give this medicine is also shown on the tube label. \n \nBuccolam must not be injected.
