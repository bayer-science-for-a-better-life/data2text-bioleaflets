NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEptifibatide Accord 0.75 mg/ml solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution for infusion contains 0.75 mg of eptifibatide. \n \nOne vial of 100 ml of solution for infusion contains 75 mg of eptifibatide. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \n0.75 mg/ml : 1.72 mg/ml (0.075 mmol/ml) sodium \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEptifibatide Accord is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin. \n \nEptifibatide Accord is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in adults presenting \nwith unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, with the last episode of chest pain \noccurring within 24 hours and with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or elevated cardiac \nenzymes. \n \nPatients most likely to benefit from Eptifibatide Accord treatment are those at high risk of developing \nmyocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina symptoms including for \ninstance those that are likely to undergo an early PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary \nAngioplasty) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis product is for hospital use only. It should be administered by specialist physicians experienced in \nthe management of acute coronary syndromes. \n \nEptifibatide Accord solution for infusion must be used in conjunction with Eptifibatide Accord \nsolution for injection. \n \nConcurrent administration of heparin is recommended unless this is contraindicated for reasons such \nas a history of thrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin (see \u2018Heparin administration\u2019, section \n4.4). Eptifibatide Accord is also intended for concurrent use with acetylsalicylic acid, as it is part of \nstandard management of patients with acute coronary syndromes, unless its use is contraindicated. \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nAdults (\u2265 18 years of age) presenting with unstable angina (UA) or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction \n(NQMI) \nThe recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram/kg administered as soon as \npossible following diagnosis, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 \nhours, until initiation of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or until discharge from the \nhospital (whichever occurs first). If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is performed during \neptifibatide therapy, continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration \nof therapy of 96 hours. \n \nEmergency or semi-elective surgery \nIf the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of eptifibatide therapy, \nterminate the infusion immediately. If the patient requires semi-elective surgery, stop the eptifibatide \ninfusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal. \n \nHepatic impairment \nExperience in patients with hepatic impairment is very limited. Administer with caution to patients \nwith hepatic impairment in whom coagulation could be affected (see section 4.3, prothrombin time). It \nis contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 30 - < 50 ml/min), an intravenous \nbolus of 180 microgram/kg should be administered followed by a continuous infusion dose of \n1.0 microgram/kg/min for the duration of therapy. This recommendation is based on \npharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data. The available clinical evidence cannot however confirm \nthat this dose modification results in a preserved benefit (see section 5.1). Use in patients with more \nsevere renal impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nIt is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, due to a lack of data \non safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nEptifibatide Accord must not be used to treat patients with: \n- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n-  evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, gross genitourinary bleeding or other active abnormal \nbleeding  within the previous 30 days of treatment \n-  history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke \n- known history of intracranial disease (neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm) \n-  major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks \n-  a history of bleeding diathesis \n-  thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 cells/mm3) \n-  prothrombin time > 1.2 times control, or International Normalized Ratio (INR) \u2265  2.0 \n-  severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure \n > 110 mm Hg on  antihypertensive therapy) \n-  severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or dependency on renal dialysis \n-  clinically significant hepatic impairment \n-  concomitant or planned administration of another parenteral glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding \nEptifibatide Accord is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation; therefore \nthe patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment (see section 4.8). \nWomen, the elderly, patients with low body weight or with moderate renal impairment (creatinine \n\n\n\n4 \n\nclearance > 30 - < 50 ml/min) may have an increased risk of bleeding. Monitor these patients closely \nwith regard to bleeding. \n \nAn increased risk of bleeding may also be observed in patients who receive early administration of \neptifibatide (e.g. upon diagnosis) compared to receiving it immediately prior to PCI, as seen in the \nEarly ACS trial. Unlike the approved posology in the EU, all patients in this trial were administered a \ndouble bolus before the infusion (see section 5.1). \n \nBleeding is most common at the arterial access site in patients undergoing percutaneous arterial \nprocedures. All potential bleeding sites, (e.g., catheter insertion sites; arterial, venous, or needle \npuncture sites; cutdown sites; gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts) must be observed carefully. \nOther potential bleeding sites such as central and peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal sites, \nmust be carefully considered too. \n \nBecause Eptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, caution must be employed when it is used \nwith other medicinal products that affect haemostasis, including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, \nthrombolytics, oral anticoagulants, dextran solutions, adenosine, sulfinpyrazone, prostacyclin, non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or dypyridamole (see section 4.5). \n \nThere is no experience with eptifibatide and low molecular weight heparins. \n \nThere is limited therapeutic experience with eptifibatide in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is \ngenerally indicated (e.g. acute transmural myocardial infarction with new pathological Q-waves or \nelevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG). Consequently the use of Eptifibatide \nAccord is not recommended in these circumstances (see section 4.5). \n \nEptifibatide Accord infusion should be stopped immediately if circumstances arise that necessitate \nthrombolytic therapy or if the patient must undergo an emergency CABG surgery or requires an \nintraortic balloon pump. \n \nIf serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure, the Eptifibatide Accord infusion \nshould be stopped immediately and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly. \n \nArterial procedures \nDuring treatment with eptifibatide there is a significant increase in bleeding rates, especially in the \nfemoral artery area, where the catheter sheath is introduced. Take care to ensure that only the anterior \nwall of the femoral artery is punctured. Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has \nreturned to normal (e.g. when activated clotting time (ACT) is less than 180 seconds (usually \n2-6 hours after discontinuation of heparin). After removal of the introducer sheath, careful haemostasis \nmust be ensured under close observation. \n \nThrombocytopenia and Immunogencity related to GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors \nEptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, but does not appear to affect the viability of platelets. \nAs demonstrated in clinical trials, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was low, and similar in patients \ntreated with eptifibatide or placebo. Thrombocytopenia, including acute profound thrombocytopenia, \nhas been observed with eptifibatide administration post-marketing (see section 4.8) \n \nThe mechanism, whether immune- and/or non-immune-mediated, by which eptifibatide may induce \nthrombocytopenia is not fully understood. However, treatment with eptifibatide was associated with \nantibodies that recognise GPIIb/IIIa occupied by eptifibatide, suggesting an immune-mediated \nmechanism. Thrombocytopenia occurring after first exposure to a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor may be \nexplained by the fact that antibodies are naturally present in some normal individuals. \n \nSince either repeat exposure with any GP IIb/IIIa ligand-mimetic agent (like abciximab or eptifibatide) \nor first-time exposure to a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor may be associated with immune-mediated \nthrombocytopenic responses, monitoring is required, i.e. platelet counts should be monitored prior to \n\n\n\n5 \n\ntreatment, within 6 hours of administration, and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy and \nimmediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency. \n \nIf either a confirmed platelet decrease to < 100,000/mm3 or acute profound thrombocytopenia is \nobserved, discontinuation of each treatment medication having known or suspected thrombocytopenic \neffects, including eptifibatide, heparin and clopidogrel, should be considered immediately. The \ndecision to use platelet transfusions should be based upon clinical judgment on an individual basis. \n \nIn patients with previous immune-mediated thrombocytopenia from other parenteral GP IIb/IIIa \ninhibitors, there are no data with the use of eptifibatide. Therefore, it is not recommended to \nadminister eptifibatide in patients who have previously experienced immune mediated \nthrombocytopenia with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including eptifibatide. \n \nHeparin administration \nHeparin administration is recommended unless a contraindication (such as a history of \nthrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin) is present. \n \nUA/NQMI: For a patient who weighs \u2265  70 kg, it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is \ngiven, followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units/hr. If the patient weighs < 70 kg, a \nbolus dose of 60 units/kg is recommended, followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/hr. The activated \npartial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 \nseconds, above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding. \n \nIf PCI is to be performed in the setting of UA/NQMI, monitor the activated clotting time (ACT) to \nmaintain a value between 300-350 seconds. Stop heparin administration if the ACT exceeds \n300 seconds; do not administer until the ACT falls below 300 seconds. \n \nMonitoring of laboratory values \nBefore infusion of Eptifibatide Accord, the following laboratory tests are recommended to identify \npreexisting haemostatic abnormalities: prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT, serum creatinine, platelet \ncount, haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. Haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count are to be \nmonitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on \ntherapy (or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease). If the platelet count falls below \n100,000/mm3, further platelet counts are required to rule out pseudothrombocytopenia. Discontinue \nunfractionated heparin. In patients undergoing PCI, measure the ACT also. \n \nSodium \nEptifibatide Accord 0.75 mg/ml solution for infusion contains 77.4 mg (3.37 mmol) of sodium per \nmaximum daily dose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWarfarin and dipyridamole \nEptifibatide did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with \nconcomitant use of warfarin and dipyridamole. Eptifibatide -treated patients who had a prothrombin \ntime (PT) > 14.5 seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk \nof bleeding. \n \nEptifibatide and thrombolytic agents \nData are limited on the use of eptifibatide in patients receiving thrombolytic agents. There was no \nconsistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with \ntissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study. Eptifibatide \nappeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial \ninfarction study. The combination of reduced dose tenecteplase and eptifibatide compared to placebo \nand eptifibatide significantly increased the risk of both major and minor bleeding when administered \nconcomitantly in an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction study. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a bolus \ninjection of 180 microgram/kg, followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours) \nwas administered concomitantly with streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes). At the highest \ninfusion rates (1.3 microgram/kg/min and 2.0 microgram/kg/min) studied, eptifibatide was associated \nwith an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence seen when \nstreptokinase was given alone. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of eptifibatide in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \nEptifibatide Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk. Interruption of breast-feeding during \nthe treatment period is recommended. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant, as Eptifibatide Accord is intended for use only in hospitalised patients. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions experienced by patients treated with eptifibatide were generally \nrelated to bleeding or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population. \n \nClinical Trials \nThe data sources used to determine adverse reaction frequency descriptors included two phase III \nclinical studies (PURSUIT and ESPRIT). These trials are briefly described below. \n \nPURSUIT: This was a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the efficacy and safety of eptifibatide \nversus placebo for reducing mortality and myocardial (re)infarction in patients with unstable angina or \nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction. \n \nESPRIT: This was a double-blind, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial \nevaluating the safety and efficacy of eptifibatide therapy in patients scheduled to undergo non-\nemergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. \n \nIn PURSUIT, bleeding and non-bleeding events were collected from hospital discharge to the 30 day \nvisit. In ESPRIT, bleeding events were reported at 48 hours, and non-bleeding events were reported at \n30 days. While Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction TIMI bleeding criteria were used to categorize \nthe incidence of major and minor bleeding in both the PURSUIT and the ESPRIT trials, PURSUIT \ndata was collected within 30 days while ESPRIT data was limited to events within 48 hours or \ndischarge, whichever came first. \n \nThe undesirable effects are listed by body system and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to<  1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). These are \nabsolute reporting frequencies without taking into account placebo rates. For a particular adverse \nreaction, if data was available from both PURSUIT and ESPRIT, then the highest reported incidence \nwas used to assign adverse reaction frequency. \nNote that causality has not been determined for all adverse reactions. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorder \nVery common Bleeding (major and minor bleeding including femoral artery access, CABG-\n\nrelated, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, retroperitoneal, intracranial, haematemesis, \nhaematuria, oral/oropharyngeal, haemoglobin/haematocrit decreased and other). \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia. \nNervous System disorders \nUncommon Cerebral ischaemia. \nCardiac Disorders \nCommon Cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart \n\nfailure, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation. \nVascular Disorders \nCommon Shock, hypotension, phlebitis. \n\n \nCardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and shock, which are \ncommonly reported events from the PURSUIT trial, were events related to the underlying disease. \n \nAdministration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding as classified \nby the criteria of the TIMI study group. At the recommended therapeutic dose, as administered in the \nPURSUIT trial involving nearly 11,000 patients, bleeding was the most common complication \nencountered during eptifibatide therapy. The most common bleeding complications were associated \nwith cardiac invasive procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related or at femoral artery \naccess site). \n \nMinor bleeding was defined in the PURSUIT trial as spontaneous gross haematuria, spontaneous \nhaematemesis, observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g/dl, or a \nhaemoglobin decrease of more than 4 g/dl in the absence of an observed bleeding site. During \ntreatment with eptifibatide in this study, minor bleeding was a very common complication (> 1/10, or \n13.1 % for eptifibatide versus 7.6 % for placebo). Bleeding events were more frequent in patients \nreceiving concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI, when ACT exceeded 350 seconds (see section \n4.4, heparin use). \n \nMajor bleeding was defined in the PURSUIT trial as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease \nin haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g/dl. Major bleeding was also very common and \nreported more frequently with eptifibatide than with placebo in the PURSUIT study (> 1/10 or 10.8 % \nversus 9.3 %), but it was infrequent in the vast majority of patients who did not undergo CABG within \n30 days of inclusion in the study. In patients undergoing CABG, the incidence of bleeding was not \nincreased by eptifibatide compared to the patients treated with placebo. In the subgroup of patients \nundergoing PCI, major bleeding was observed commonly, in 9.7 % of eptifibatide -treated patients vs. \n4.6 % of placebo-treated patients. \n \nThe incidence of severe or life threatening bleeding events with eptifibatide was 1.9 % compared to \n1.1 % with placebo. The need for blood transfusions was increased modestly by eptifibatide treatment \n(11.8 % versus 9.3 % for placebo). \n \nChanges during eptifibatide treatment result from its known pharmacological action, i.e., inhibition of \nplatelet aggregation. Thus, changes in laboratory parameters associated with bleeding (e.g. bleeding \ntime) are common and expected. No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with \neptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, alkaline \nphosphatase) or renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen). \n \nPost-marketing experience \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery rare Fatal bleeding (the majority involved central and peripheral nervous system \n\ndisorders: cerebral or intracranial haemorrhages); pulmonary haemorrhage, \nacute profound thrombocytopenia, haematoma. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nImmune system disorders \nVery rare Anaphylactic reactions. \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare Rash, application site disorders such as urticaria. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe experience in humans with overdose of eptifibatide is extremely limited. There was no indication \nof severe adverse reactions associated with administration of accidental large bolus doses, rapid \ninfusion reported as overdose or large cumulative doses. In the PURSUIT trial, there were 9 patients \nwho received bolus and/or infusion doses more than double the recommended dose, or who were \nidentified by the investigator as having received an overdose. There was no excessive bleeding in any \nof these patients, although one patient undergoing CABG surgery was reported as having had a \nmoderate bleed. Specifically, no patients experienced an intracranial bleed. \n \nPotentially, an overdose of eptifibatide could result in bleeding. Because of its short half-life and rapid \nclearance, the activity of eptifibatide may be halted readily by discontinuing the infusion. Thus, \nalthough eptifibatide can be dialysed, the need for dialysis is unlikely. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agent (platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin), ATC \ncode: B01AC16 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids, including one cysteine amide \nand one mercaptopropionyl (desamino cysteinyl) residue, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and \nbelongs to the class of RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate)-mimetics. \n \nEptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von \nWillebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner as \ndemonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists to \ninduce platelet aggregation. The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a \n180 microgram/kg intravenous bolus. When followed by a 2.0 microgram/kg/min continuous infusion, \nthis regimen produces a > 80 % inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation, at physiologic \ncalcium concentrations, in more than 80 % of patients. \n \nPlatelet inhibition was readily reversed, with a return of platelet function towards baseline (> 50 % \nplatelet aggregation) 4 hours after stopping a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram/kg/min. \nMeasurements of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation at physiologic calcium concentrations \n(Dphenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone anticoagulant) in patients presenting with \nunstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nwith an IC50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) of approximately 550 ng/ml and an IC80 (80 % inhibitory \nconcentration) of approximately 1,100 ng/ml. \n \nThere is limited data with regards to platelet inhibition in patients with renal impairment. In patients \nwith moderate renal impairment, (creatinine clearance 30 - 50 ml/min) 100 % inhibition was achieved \nat 24 hours following administration of 2 microgram/kg/min. In patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) administered 1microgram/kg/min , 80 % inhibition was achieved in \nmore than 80 % of patients at 24 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPURSUIT trial \nThe pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina (UA)/Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction (NQMI) was \nPURSUIT. This study was a 726-center, 27-country, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled \nstudy in 10,948 patients presenting with UA or NQMI. Patients could be enrolled only if they had \nexperienced cardiac ischemia at rest (\u2265 10 minutes) within the previous 24 hours and had: \n\n\u2022 either ST-segment changes: ST depression > 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST \nelevation > 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents, T-wave \ninversion (> 1 mm), \n\n\u2022 or increased CK-MB. \n \nPatients were randomised to either placebo, eptifibatide 180 microgram/kg bolus followed by a \n2.0 microgram/kg/min infusion (180/2.0), or eptifibatide 180 microgram/kg bolus followed by a \n1.3 microgram/kg/min infusion (180/1.3). \n \nThe infusion was continued until hospital discharge, until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting \n(CABG) or for up to 72 hours, whichever occurred first. If PCI was performed, the eptifibatide \ninfusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure, allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 \nhours. \n \nThe 180/1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, when the two \nactive-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding. \n \nPatients were managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site; frequencies of \nangiography, PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. \nOf the patients in PURSUIT, 13 % were managed with PCI during eptifibatide infusion, of whom \napproximately 50 % received intracoronary stents; 87 % were managed medically (without PCI during \neptifibatide infusion). \n \nThe vast majority of patients received acetylsalicylic acid (75-325 mg once daily). \n \nUnfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician\u2019s \ndiscretion, most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of \n1,000 U/h. A target aPTT of 50-70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1,250 patients underwent \nPCI within 72 hours after randomisation, in which case they received intravenous unfractionated \nheparin to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of 300-350 seconds. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial \ninfarction (MI) (evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee) within 30 days of randomisation. \nThe component MI could be defined as asymptomatic with enzymatic elevation of CK-MB or new Q \nwave. \n \nCompared to placebo, eptifibatide administered as 180/2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the \nprimary endpoint events (table 1): this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated: \n \n \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 1: Incidence of Death/CEC-Assessed MI (\u00abTreated as Randomised\u00bb Population) \n \nTime Placebo Eptifibatide p-Value \n30 days 743/4,697 \n\n(15.8 %) \n667/4,680 \n(14.3 %) \n\n0.034a \n\na: Pearson\u2019s chi-square test of difference between placebo and eptifibatide. \n \nResults on the primary endpoint were principally attributed to the occurrence of myocardial infarction. \nThe reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early \nduring treatment (within the first 72-96 hours) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months, \nwithout any significant effect on mortality. \n \nPatients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing \nmyocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina. \n \nAccording to epidemiological findings, a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been \nassociated with certain indicators, for instance: \n-  age \n-  elevated heart rate or blood pressure \n-  persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain \n-  marked ECG changes (in particular ST-segment abnormalities) \n-  raised cardiac enzymes or markers (e.g. CK-MB, troponins) and \n-  heart failure \n \nPURSUIT was conducted at a time when the standard of care of managing acute coronary syndromes \nwas different from that of present times in terms of thienopyridine use and the routine use of \nintracoronary stents. \n \nESPRIT trial \nESPRIT (Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with eptifibatide Therapy) was a \ndouble-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (n= 2,064) for nonurgent PCI with intracoronary \nstenting. \n \nAll patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide (2 \nbolus doses of 180 microgram/kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a \nmaximum of 18-24 hours). \n \nThe first bolus and the infusion were started simultaneously, immediately before the PCI procedure \nand were followed by a second bolus 10 minutes after the first. The rate of infusion was 2.0 \nmicrogram/kg/min for patients with serum creatinine \u2264 175 micromols/l or 1.0 microgram/kg/min for \nserum creatinine > 175 up to 350 micromols/l. \n \nIn the eptifibatide arm of the trial, virtually all patients received aspirin (99.7 %), and 98.1 % received \na thienopyridine, (clopidogrel in 95.4 % and ticlopidine in 2.7 %). On the day of PCI, prior to \ncatheterization, 53.2 % received a thienopyridine (clopidogrel 52.7 %; ticlopidine 0.5 %) \u2013 mostly as a \nloading dose (300 mg or more). The placebo arm was comparable (aspirin 99.7 %, clopidogrel 95.9 %, \nticlopidin 2.6 %). \n \nThe ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of \n60 units/kg, with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds. The primary endpoint of the trial was death (D), \nMI, urgent target vessel revascularisation (UTVR), and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb/IIIa \ninhibitor therapy (RT) within 48 hours of randomisation. \n \nMI was identified per the CK-MB core laboratory criteria. For this diagnosis, within 24 hours after the \nindex PCI procedure, there had to be at least two CK-MB values \u2265  3 x the upper limit of normal; thus, \nvalidation by the CEC was not required. MI could also be reported following CEC adjudication of an \ninvestigator report. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nThe primary endpoint analysis [quadruple composite of death, MI, urgent target vessel \nrevascularisation (UTVR) and thrombolytic bail-out (TBO) at 48 hours] showed a 37 % relative and \n3.9 % absolute reduction in the eptifibatide group (6.6 % events versus 10.5 %, p=  0.0015). Results \non the primary endpoint were mainly attributed to the reduction of enzymatic MI occurrence, \nidentified as the occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI (80 out of 92 MIs in the \nplacebo group vs. 47 out of 56 MIs in the eptifibatide group). The clinical relevance of such enzymatic \nMIs is still controversial. \n \nSimilar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days: a triple \ncomposite of death, MI and UTVR, and the more robust combination of death and MI. \n \nThe reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early \nduring treatment. There was no increased benefit thereafter, up to 1 year. \n \nProlongation of bleeding time \nAdministration of eptifibatide by intravenous bolus and infusion causes up to a 5-fold increase in \nbleeding time. This increase is readily reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion with bleeding \ntimes returning towards baseline in approximately 6 (2-8) hours. When administered alone, \neptifibatide has no measurable effect on prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin \ntime (aPTT). \n \nEARLY-ACS trial \nEARLY ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Non-ST-segment Elevation Acute Coronary \nSyndrome) was a study of early routine eptifibatide versus placebo (with delayed provisional use of \neptifibatide in the catheterization laboratory) used in combination with antithrombotic therapies (ASA, \nUFH, bivalirudin, fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin), in subjects with high-risk NSTE \nACS. Patients were to undergo an invasive strategy for further management after receiving study drug \nfor 12 to 96 hours. Patients could be medically managed, proceed to coronary artery bypass graft \n(CABG), or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Unlike the approved posology in the \nEU, the study used a double bolus of study drug (separated by 10 minutes) before the infusion. \n \nEarly routine eptifibatide in this high-risk NSTE-ACS optimally-treated population who were \nmanaged with an invasive strategy did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the \ncomposite primary endpoint of rate of death, MI, RI-UR, and TBO within 96 hours compared with a \nregimen of delayed provisional eptifibatide (9.3 % in early eptifibatide patients vs. 10.0 % in patients \nassigned to delayed provisional eptifibatide; odds ratio=0.920; 95 % CI=0.802-1.055; p=0.234). \nGUSTO severe/life threatening bleeding was uncommon and comparable in both treatment groups \n(0.8 %). GUSTO moderate or severe/life threatening bleeding occurred significantly more often with \nearly routine eptifibatide (7.4 % vs. 5.0 % in delayed provisional eptifibatide group; p <0.001). Similar \ndifferences were noted for TIMI major haemorrhage (118 [2.5 %] in early routine use vs. 83 [1.8 %] in \ndelayed provisional use; p=0.016). \n \nNo statistically significant benefit of early routine eptifibatide strategy was demonstrated in the \nsubgroup of patients who were managed medically or during the medical management periods prior to \nPCI or CABG. \n \nIn a post hoc analysis of the EARLY ACS trial the risk benefit of dose reduction in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment is inconclusive. The primary endpoint event rate was 11.9 % in patients \nwho received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 11.2 % in patients who received the standard \ndose (2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early routine fashion (p=0.81). \nWith delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the event rates were 10 % vs 11.5 % in patients \nwho received reduced dose and standard dose respectively (p=0.61). TIMI major bleeding occurred in \n2.7 % of patients who received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 4.2 % of patients who \nreceived the standard dose (2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early \nroutine fashion (p=0.36). With delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the TIMI major events \n\n\n\n12 \n\nwere 1.4 % vs 2.0 % in patients who received reduced dose and standard dose respectively \n(p=0.54).There were no notable differences observed with GUSTO severe bleeding rates. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 \nto 250 microgram/kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram/kg/min.  \n \nDistrobution \nFor a 2.0 microgram/kg/min infusion, mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from \n1.5 to 2.2 microgram/ml in patients with coronary artery disease. These plasma concentrations are \nachieved rapidly when the infusion is preceded by a 180microgram/kg bolus.  \nBiotransformation \nThe extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25 %. In the same population, \nplasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours, plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml/kg/hr and \nvolume of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml/kg. \n \nElimination \nIn healthy subjects, renal excretion accounted for approximately 50 % of total body clearance; \napproximately 50 % of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged. In patients with moderate to severe \nrenal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min), the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by \napproximately 50 % and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled. \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted. However, in a population \npharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide \nand the following concomitant medicinal products: amlodipine, atenolol, atropine, captopril, cefazolin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, enalapril, fentanyl, furosemide, heparin, lidocaine, \nlisinopril, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitrates, nifedipine, and warfarin. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat, \nrabbit and monkey, reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity \nstudies, and irritation, hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies. No unexpected toxic effects for an \nagent with this pharmacologic profile were observed and findings were predictive of clinical \nexperience, with bleeding effects being the principal adverse event. No genotoxic effects were \nobserved with eptifibatide. \n \nTeratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant \nrats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human \ndose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/kg/day \n(about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis). These \nstudies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to eptifibatide. \n \nReproduction studies in animal species where eptifibatide shows a similar pharmacologic activity as in \nhumans are not available. Consequently these studies are not suitable to evaluate the toxicity of \neptifibatide on reproductive function (see section 4.6). \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide has not been evaluated in long-term studies. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nEptifibatide Accord is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin. \n \nEptifibatide Accord is indicated for the prevention of early myocardial infarction in adults presenting \nwith unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, with the last episode of chest pain \noccurring within 24 hours and with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or elevated cardiac \nenzymes. \n \nPatients most likely to benefit from Eptifibatide Accord treatment are those at high risk of developing \nmyocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina symptoms including for \ninstance those that are likely to undergo an early PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary \nAngioplasty) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis product is for hospital use only. It should be administered by specialist physicians experienced in \nthe management of acute coronary syndromes. \n \nEptifibatide Accord solution for injection must be used in conjunction with Eptifibatide Accord \nsolution for infusion. \n \nConcurrent administration of heparin is recommended unless this is contraindicated for reasons such \nas a history of thrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin (see \u2018Heparin administration\u2019, section \n4.4). Eptifibatide Accord is also intended for concurrent use with acetylsalicylic acid, as it is part of \nstandard management of patients with acute coronary syndromes, unless its use is contraindicated. \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAdults (\u2265 18 years of age) presenting with unstable angina (UA) or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction \n(NQMI) \nThe recommended dosage is an intravenous bolus of 180 microgram/kg administered as soon as \npossible following diagnosis, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 \nhours, until initiation of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or until discharge from the \nhospital (whichever occurs first). If Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is performed during \neptifibatide therapy, continue the infusion for 20-24 hours post-PCI for an overall maximum duration \nof therapy of 96 hours. \n \nEmergency or semi-elective surgery \nIf the patient requires emergency or urgent cardiac surgery during the course of eptifibatide therapy, \nterminate the infusion immediately. If the patient requires semi-elective surgery, stop the eptifibatide \ninfusion at an appropriate time to allow time for platelet function to return towards normal. \n \nHepatic impairment \nExperience in patients with hepatic impairment is very limited. Administer with caution to patients \nwith hepatic impairment in whom coagulation could be affected (see section 4.3, prothrombin time). It \nis contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance \u2265 30 - < 50 ml/min), an intravenous \nbolus of 180 microgram/kg should be administered followed by a continuous infusion dose of \n1.0 microgram/kg/min for the duration of therapy. This recommendation is based on \npharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data. The available clinical evidence cannot however confirm \nthat this dose modification results in a preserved benefit (see section 5.1). Use in patients with more \nsevere renal impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nPaediatric population \nIt is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age, due to a lack of data \non safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nEptifibatide Accord must not be used to treat patients with: \n- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n-  evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, gross genitourinary bleeding or other active abnormal \nbleeding  within the previous 30 days of treatment \n-  history of stroke within 30 days or any history of haemorrhagic stroke \n- known history of intracranial disease (neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm) \n-  major surgery or severe trauma within past 6 weeks \n-  a history of bleeding diathesis \n-  thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 cells/mm3) \n-  prothrombin time > 1.2 times control, or International Normalized Ratio (INR) \u2265 2.0 \n-  severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mm \nHg on  antihypertensive therapy) \n-  severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) or dependency on renal dialysis \n-  clinically significant hepatic impairment \n-  concomitant or planned administration of another parenteral glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding \nEptifibatide Accord is an antithrombotic agent that acts by inhibition of platelet aggregation; therefore \nthe patient must be observed carefully for indications of bleeding during treatment (see section 4.8). \nWomen, the elderly, patients with low body weight or with moderate renal impairment (creatinine \n\n\n\n17 \n\nclearance > 30 - < 50 ml/min) may have an increased risk of bleeding. Monitor these patients closely \nwith regard to bleeding. \n \nAn increased risk of bleeding may also be observed in patients who receive early administration of \neptifibatide (e.g. upon diagnosis) compared to receiving it immediately prior to PCI, as seen in the \nEarly ACS trial. Unlike the approved posology in the EU, all patients in this trial were administered a \ndouble bolus before the infusion (see section 5.1). \n \nBleeding is most common at the arterial access site in patients undergoing percutaneous arterial \nprocedures. All potential bleeding sites, (e.g., catheter insertion sites; arterial, venous, or needle \npuncture sites; cutdown sites; gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts) must be observed carefully. \nOther potential bleeding sites such as central and peripheral nervous system and retroperitoneal sites, \nmust be carefully considered too. \n \nBecause Eptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, caution must be employed when it is used \nwith other medicinal products that affect haemostasis, including ticlopidine, clopidogrel, \nthrombolytics, oral anticoagulants, dextran solutions, adenosine, sulfinpyrazone, prostacyclin, non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or dypyridamole (see section 4.5). \n \nThere is no experience with eptifibatide and low molecular weight heparins. \n \nThere is limited therapeutic experience with eptifibatide in patients for whom thrombolytic therapy is \ngenerally indicated (e.g. acute transmural myocardial infarction with new pathological Q-waves or \nelevated ST-segments or left bundle branch block in the ECG). Consequently the use of Eptifibatide \nAccord is not recommended in these circumstances (see section 4.5). \n \nEptifibatide Accord infusion should be stopped immediately if circumstances arise that necessitate \nthrombolytic therapy or if the patient must undergo an emergency CABG surgery or requires an \nintraortic balloon pump. \n \nIf serious bleeding occurs that is not controllable with pressure, the Eptifibatide Accord infusion \nshould be stopped immediately and any unfractionated heparin that is given concomitantly. \n \nArterial procedures \nDuring treatment with eptifibatide there is a significant increase in bleeding rates, especially in the \nfemoral artery area, where the catheter sheath is introduced. Take care to ensure that only the anterior \nwall of the femoral artery is punctured. Arterial sheaths may be removed when coagulation has \nreturned to normal (e.g. when activated clotting time (ACT) is less than 180 seconds (usually \n2-6 hours after discontinuation of heparin). After removal of the introducer sheath, careful haemostasis \nmust be ensured under close observation. \n \nThrombocytopenia and Immunogencity related to GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors \nEptifibatide Accord inhibits platelet aggregation, but does not appear to affect the viability of platelets. \nAs demonstrated in clinical trials, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was low, and similar in patients \ntreated with eptifibatide or placebo. Thrombocytopenia, including acute profound thrombocytopenia, \nhas been observed with eptifibatide administration post-marketing (see section 4.8) \n \nThe mechanism, whether immune- and/or non-immune-mediated, by which eptifibatide may induce \nthrombocytopenia is not fully understood. However, treatment with eptifibatide was associated with \nantibodies that recognise GPIIb/IIIa occupied by eptifibatide, suggesting an immune-mediated \nmechanism. Thrombocytopenia occurring after first exposure to a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor may be \nexplained by the fact that antibodies are naturally present in some normal individuals. \n \nSince either repeat exposure with any GP IIb/IIIa ligand-mimetic agent (like abciximab or eptifibatide) \nor first-time exposure to a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor may be associated with immune-mediated \nthrombocytopenic responses, monitoring is required, i.e. platelet counts should be monitored prior to \n\n\n\n18 \n\ntreatment, within 6 hours of administration, and at least once daily thereafter while on therapy and \nimmediately at clinical signs of unexpected bleeding tendency. \n \nIf either a confirmed platelet decrease to < 100,000/mm3 or acute profound thrombocytopenia is \nobserved, discontinuation of each treatment medication having known or suspected thrombocytopenic \neffects, including eptifibatide, heparin and clopidogrel, should be considered immediately. The \ndecision to use platelet transfusions should be based upon clinical judgment on an individual basis. \n \nIn patients with previous immune-mediated thrombocytopenia from other parenteral GP IIb/IIIa \ninhibitors, there are no data with the use of eptifibatide. Therefore, it is not recommended to \nadminister eptifibatide in patients who have previously experienced immune mediated \nthrombocytopenia with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, including eptifibatide. \n \nHeparin administration \nHeparin administration is recommended unless a contraindication (such as a history of \nthrombocytopenia associated with use of heparin) is present. \n \nUA/NQMI: For a patient who weighs \u2265  70 kg, it is recommended that a bolus dose of 5,000 units is \ngiven, followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 1,000 units/hr. If the patient weighs < 70 kg, a \nbolus dose of 60 units/kg is recommended, followed by an infusion of 12 units/kg/hr. The activated \npartial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be monitored in order to maintain a value between 50 and 70 \nseconds, above 70 seconds there may be an increased risk of bleeding. \n \nIf PCI is to be performed in the setting of UA/NQMI, monitor the activated clotting time (ACT) to \nmaintain a value between 300-350 seconds. Stop heparin administration if the ACT exceeds \n300 seconds; do not administer until the ACT falls below 300 seconds. \n \nMonitoring of laboratory values \nBefore infusion of Eptifibatide Accord, the following laboratory tests are recommended to identify \npreexisting haemostatic abnormalities: prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT, serum creatinine, platelet \ncount, haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. Haemoglobin, haematocrit, and platelet count are to be \nmonitored as well within 6 hours after start of therapy and at least once daily thereafter while on \ntherapy (or more often if there is evidence of a marked decrease). If the platelet count falls below \n100,000/mm3, further platelet counts are required to rule out pseudothrombocytopenia. Discontinue \nunfractionated heparin. In patients undergoing PCI, measure the ACT also. \n \nSodium \nEptifibatide Accord 2 mg/ml solution for injection contains 57.96 mg (2.52 mmol) of sodium per \nmaximum daily dose. This should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWarfarin and dipyridamole \nEptifibatide did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with \nconcomitant use of warfarin and dipyridamole. Eptifibatide -treated patients who had a prothrombin \ntime (PT) > 14.5 seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk \nof bleeding. \n \nEptifibatide and thrombolytic agents \nData are limited on the use of eptifibatide in patients receiving thrombolytic agents. There was no \nconsistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with \ntissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study. Eptifibatide \nappeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myocardial \ninfarction study. The combination of reduced dose tenecteplase and eptifibatide compared to placebo \nand eptifibatide significantly increased the risk of both major and minor bleeding when administered \nconcomitantly in an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction study. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a bolus \ninjection of 180 microgram/kg, followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours) \nwas administered concomitantly with streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes). At the highest \ninfusion rates (1.3 microgram/kg/min and 2.0 microgram/kg/min) studied, eptifibatide was associated \nwith an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence seen when \nstreptokinase was given alone. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of eptifibatide in pregnant women. \n \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.  \nEptifibatide Accord should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk. Interruption of breast-feeding during \nthe treatment period is recommended. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant, as Eptifibatide Accord is intended for use only in hospitalised patients. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe majority of adverse reactions experienced by patients treated with eptifibatide were generally \nrelated to bleeding or to cardiovascular events that occur frequently in this patient population. \n \nClinical Trials \nThe data sources used to determine adverse reaction frequency descriptors included two phase III \nclinical studies (PURSUIT and ESPRIT). These trials are briefly described below. \n \nPURSUIT: This was a randomized, double-blind evaluation of the efficacy and safety of eptifibatide \nversus placebo for reducing mortality and myocardial (re)infarction in patients with unstable angina or \nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction. \n \nESPRIT: This was a double-blind, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial \nevaluating the safety and efficacy of eptifibatide therapy in patients scheduled to undergo non-\nemergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. \n \nIn PURSUIT, bleeding and non-bleeding events were collected from hospital discharge to the 30 day \nvisit. In ESPRIT, bleeding events were reported at 48 hours, and non-bleeding events were reported at \n30 days. While Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction TIMI bleeding criteria were used to categorize \nthe incidence of major and minor bleeding in both the PURSUIT and the ESPRIT trials, PURSUIT \ndata was collected within 30 days while ESPRIT data was limited to events within 48 hours or \ndischarge, whichever came first. \n \nThe undesirable effects are listed by body system and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to< 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to<  1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). These are \nabsolute reporting frequencies without taking into account placebo rates. For a particular adverse \nreaction, if data was available from both PURSUIT and ESPRIT, then the highest reported incidence \nwas used to assign adverse reaction frequency. \n \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nNote that causality has not been determined for all adverse reactions. \n \nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorder \nVery common Bleeding (major and minor bleeding including femoral artery access, \n\nCABG-related, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, retroperitoneal, intracranial, \nhaematemesis, haematuria, oral/oropharyngeal, haemoglobin/haematocrit \ndecreased and other). \n\nUncommon Thrombocytopenia. \nNervous System disorders \nUncommon Cerebral ischaemia. \nCardiac Disorders \nCommon Cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, congestive \n\nheart failure, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation. \nVascular Disorders \nCommon Shock, hypotension, phlebitis. \n \nCardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and shock, which are \ncommonly reported events from the PURSUIT trial, were events related to the underlying disease. \n \nAdministration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding as classified \nby the criteria of the TIMI study group. At the recommended therapeutic dose, as administered in the \nPURSUIT trial involving nearly 11,000patients, bleeding was the most common complication \nencountered during eptifibatide therapy. The most common bleeding complications were associated \nwith cardiac invasive procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related or at femoral artery \naccess site). \n \nMinor bleeding was defined in the PURSUIT trial as spontaneous gross haematuria, spontaneous \nhaematemesis, observed blood loss with a haemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g/dl, or a \nhaemoglobin decrease of more than 4 g/dl in the absence of an observed bleeding site. During \ntreatment with eptifibatide in this study, minor bleeding was a very common complication (> 1/10, or \n13.1 % for eptifibatide versus 7.6 % for placebo). Bleeding events were more frequent in patients \nreceiving concurrent heparin while undergoing PCI, when ACT exceeded 350 seconds (see section \n4.4, heparin use). \n \nMajor bleeding was defined in the PURSUIT trial as either an intracranial haemorrhage or a decrease \nin haemoglobin concentrations of more than 5 g/dl. Major bleeding was also very common and \nreported more frequently with eptifibatide than with placebo in the PURSUIT study (> 1/10 or 10.8 % \nversus 9.3 %), but it was infrequent in the vast majority of patients who did not undergo CABG within \n30 days of inclusion in the study. In patients undergoing CABG, the incidence of bleeding was not \nincreased by eptifibatide compared to the patients treated with placebo. In the subgroup of patients \nundergoing PCI, major bleeding was observed commonly, in 9.7 % of eptifibatide -treated patients vs. \n4.6 % of placebo-treated patients. \n \nThe incidence of severe or life threatening bleeding events with eptifibatide was 1.9 % compared to \n1.1 % with placebo. The need for blood transfusions was increased modestly by eptifibatide treatment \n(11.8 % versus 9.3 % for placebo). \n \nChanges during eptifibatide treatment result from its known pharmacological action, i.e., inhibition of \nplatelet aggregation. Thus, changes in laboratory parameters associated with bleeding (e.g. bleeding \ntime) are common and expected. No apparent differences were observed between patients treated with \neptifibatide or with placebo in values for liver function (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, alkaline \nphosphatase) or renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen). \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPost-marketing experience \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nVery rare Fatal bleeding (the majority involved central and peripheral nervous system \n\ndisorders: cerebral or intracranial haemorrhages); pulmonary haemorrhage, \nacute profound thrombocytopenia, haematoma. \n\nImmune system disorders \nVery rare Anaphylactic reactions. \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nVery rare Rash, application site disorders such as urticaria. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe experience in humans with overdose of eptifibatide is extremely limited. There was no indication \nof severe adverse reactions associated with administration of accidental large bolus doses, rapid \ninfusion reported as overdose or large cumulative doses. In the PURSUIT trial, there were 9 patients \nwho received bolus and/or infusion doses more than double the recommended dose, or who were \nidentified by the investigator as having received an overdose. There was no excessive bleeding in any \nof these patients, although one patient undergoing CABG surgery was reported as having had a \nmoderate bleed. Specifically, no patients experienced an intracranial bleed. \n \nPotentially, an overdose of eptifibatide could result in bleeding. Because of its short half-life and rapid \nclearance, the activity of eptifibatide may be halted readily by discontinuing the infusion. Thus, \nalthough eptifibatide can be dialysed, the need for dialysis is unlikely. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agent (platelet aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin), ATC \ncode: B01AC16 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nEptifibatide, a synthetic cyclic heptapeptide containing six amino acids, including one cysteine amide \nand one mercaptopropionyl (desamino cysteinyl) residue, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and \nbelongs to the class of RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate)-mimetics. \n \nEptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von \nWillebrand factor and other adhesive ligands to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEptifibatide inhibits platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner as \ndemonstrated by ex vivo platelet aggregation using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and other agonists to \ninduce platelet aggregation. The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a \n180 microgram/kg intravenous bolus. When followed by a 2.0 microgram/kg/min continuous infusion, \nthis regimen produces a > 80 % inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation, at physiologic \ncalcium concentrations, in more than 80 % of patients. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n22 \n\n \nPlatelet inhibition was readily reversed, with a return of platelet function towards baseline (> 50 % \nplatelet aggregation) 4 hours after stopping a continuous infusion of 2.0 microgram/kg/min. \nMeasurements of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation at physiologic calcium concentrations \n(Dphenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone anticoagulant) in patients presenting with \nunstable angina and Non Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction showed a concentration-dependent inhibition \nwith an IC50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) of approximately 550 ng/ml and an IC80 (80 % inhibitory \nconcentration) of approximately 1,100 ng/ml. \n \nThere is limited data with regards to platelet inhibition in patients with renal impairment. In patients \nwith moderate renal impairment, (creatinine clearance 30 - 50 ml/min) 100 % inhibition was achieved \nat 24 hours following administration of 2 microgram/kg/min. In patients with severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) administered 1microgram/kg/min , 80 % inhibition was achieved in \nmore than 80 % of patients at 24 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nPURSUIT trial \nThe pivotal clinical trial for Unstable Angina (UA)/Non-Q Wave Myocardial Infarction (NQMI) was \nPURSUIT. This study was a 726-center, 27-country, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled \nstudy in 10,948 patients presenting with UA or NQMI. Patients could be enrolled only if they had \nexperienced cardiac ischemia at rest (\u2265 10 minutes) within the previous 24 hours and had: \n\n\u2022 either ST-segment changes: ST depression > 0.5 mm of less than 30 minutes or persistent ST \nelevation > 0.5 mm not requiring reperfusion therapy or thrombolytic agents, T-wave \ninversion (> 1 mm), \n\n\u2022 or increased CK-MB. \n \nPatients were randomised to either placebo, eptifibatide 180 microgram/kg bolus followed by a \n2.0 microgram/kg/min infusion (180/2.0), or eptifibatide 180 microgram/kg bolus followed by a \n1.3 microgram/kg/min infusion (180/1.3). \n \nThe infusion was continued until hospital discharge, until the time of coronary artery bypass grafting \n(CABG) or for up to 72 hours, whichever occurred first. If PCI was performed, the eptifibatide \ninfusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure, allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 \nhours. \n \nThe 180/1.3 arm was stopped after an interim analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, when the two \nactive-treatment arms appeared to have a similar incidence of bleeding. \n \nPatients were managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site; frequencies of \nangiography, PCI and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. \nOf the patients in PURSUIT, 13 % were managed with PCI during eptifibatide infusion, of whom \napproximately 50 % received intracoronary stents; 87 % were managed medically (without PCI during \neptifibatide infusion). \n \nThe vast majority of patients received acetylsalicylic acid (75-325 mg once daily). \n \nUnfractionated heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously at the physician\u2019s \ndiscretion, most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5,000 U followed by a continuous infusion of \n1,000 U/h. A target aPTT of 50-70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1,250 patients underwent \nPCI within 72 hours after randomisation, in which case they received intravenous unfractionated \nheparin to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of 300-350 seconds. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new myocardial \ninfarction (MI) (evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee) within 30 days of randomisation. \nThe component MI could be defined as asymptomatic with enzymatic elevation of CK-MB or new Q \nwave. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nCompared to placebo, eptifibatide administered as 180/2.0 significantly reduced the incidence of the \nprimary endpoint events (table 1): this represents around 15 events avoided for 1,000 patients treated: \n \nTable 1: Incidence of Death/CEC-Assessed MI (\u00abTreated as Randomised\u00bb Population) \n \nTime Placebo Eptifibatide p-Value \n30 days 743/4,697 \n\n(15.8 %) \n667/4,680 \n(14.3 %) \n\n0.034a \n\na: Pearson\u2019s chi-square test of difference between placebo and eptifibatide. \n \nResults on the primary endpoint were principally attributed to the occurrence of myocardial infarction. \nThe reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early \nduring treatment (within the first 72-96 hours) and this reduction was maintained through 6 months, \nwithout any significant effect on mortality. \n \nPatients most likely to benefit from eptifibatide treatment are those at high risk of developing \nmyocardial infarction within the first 3-4 days after onset of acute angina. \n \nAccording to epidemiological findings, a higher incidence of cardiovascular events has been \nassociated with certain indicators, for instance: \n-  age \n-  elevated heart rate or blood pressure \n-  persistent or recurrent ischemic cardiac pain \n-  marked ECG changes (in particular ST-segment abnormalities) \n-  raised cardiac enzymes or markers (e.g. CK-MB, troponins) and \n-  heart failure \n \nPURSUIT was conducted at a time when the standard of care of managing acute coronary syndromes \nwas different from that of present times in terms of thienopyridine use and the routine use of \nintracoronary stents. \n \nESPRIT trial \nESPRIT (Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with eptifibatide Therapy) was a \ndouble-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (n= 2,064) for nonurgent PCI with intracoronary \nstenting. \n \nAll patients received routine standard of care and were randomised to either placebo or eptifibatide (2 \nbolus doses of 180 microgram/kg and a continuous infusion until discharge from hospital or a \nmaximum of 18-24 hours). \n \nThe first bolus and the infusion were started simultaneously, immediately before the PCI procedure \nand were followed by a second bolus 10 minutes after the first. The rate of infusion was 2.0 \nmicrogram/kg/min for patients with serum creatinine \u2264 175 micromols/l or 1.0 microgram/kg/min for \nserum creatinine > 175 up to 350 micromols/l. \n \nIn the eptifibatide arm of the trial, virtually all patients received aspirin (99.7 %), and 98.1 % received \na thienopyridine, (clopidogrel in 95.4 % and ticlopidine in 2.7 %). On the day of PCI, prior to \ncatheterization, 53.2 % received a thienopyridine (clopidogrel 52.7 %; ticlopidine 0.5 %) \u2013 mostly as a \nloading dose (300 mg or more). The placebo arm was comparable (aspirin 99.7 %, clopidogrel 95.9 %, \nticlopidin 2.6 %). \n \nThe ESPRIT trial used a simplified regimen of heparin during PCI that consisted of an initial bolus of \n60 units/kg, with a target ACT of 200 - 300 seconds. The primary endpoint of the trial was death (D), \nMI, urgent target vessel revascularisation (UTVR), and acute antithrombotic rescue with GP IIb/IIIa \ninhibitor therapy (RT) within 48 hours of randomisation. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nMI was identified per the CK-MB core laboratory criteria. For this diagnosis, within 24 hours after the \nindex PCI procedure, there had to be at least two CK-MB values \u2265 3 x the upper limit of normal; thus, \nvalidation by the CEC was not required. MI could also be reported following CEC adjudication of an \ninvestigator report. \n \nThe primary endpoint analysis [quadruple composite of death, MI, urgent target vessel \nrevascularisation (UTVR) and thrombolytic bail-out (TBO) at 48 hours] showed a 37 % relative and \n3.9 % absolute reduction in the eptifibatide group (6.6 % events versus 10.5 %, p = 0.0015). Results \non the primary endpoint were mainly attributed to the reduction of enzymatic MI occurrence, \nidentified as the occurrence of early elevation of cardiac enzymes after PCI (80 out of 92 MIs in the \nplacebo group vs. 47 out of 56 MIs in the eptifibatide group). The clinical relevance of such enzymatic \nMIs is still controversial. \n \nSimilar results were also obtained for the 2 secondary endpoints assessed at 30 days: a triple \ncomposite of death, MI and UTVR, and the more robust combination of death and MI. \n \nThe reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide appeared early \nduring treatment. There was no increased benefit thereafter, up to 1 year. \n \nProlongation of bleeding time \nAdministration of eptifibatide by intravenous bolus and infusion causes up to a 5-fold increase in \nbleeding time. This increase is readily reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion with bleeding \ntimes returning towards baseline in approximately 6 (2-8) hours. When administered alone, \neptifibatide has no measurable effect on prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin \ntime (aPTT). \n \nEARLY-ACS trial \nEARLY ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Non-ST-segment Elevation Acute Coronary \nSyndrome) was a study of early routine eptifibatide versus placebo (with delayed provisional use of \neptifibatide in the catheterization laboratory) used in combination with antithrombotic therapies (ASA, \nUFH, bivalirudin, fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin), in subjects with high-risk NSTE \nACS. Patients were to undergo an invasive strategy for further management after receiving study drug \nfor 12 to 96 hours. Patients could be medically managed, proceed to coronary artery bypass graft \n(CABG), or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Unlike the approved posology in the \nEU, the study used a double bolus of study drug (separated by 10 minutes) before the infusion. \n \nEarly routine eptifibatide in this high-risk NSTE-ACS optimally-treated population who were \nmanaged with an invasive strategy did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the \ncomposite primary endpoint of rate of death, MI, RI-UR, and TBO within 96 hours compared with a \nregimen of delayed provisional eptifibatide (9.3 % in early eptifibatide patients vs. 10.0 % in patients \nassigned to delayed provisional eptifibatide; odds ratio=0.920; 95 % CI=0.802-1.055; p=0.234). \nGUSTO severe/life threatening bleeding was uncommon and comparable in both treatment groups \n(0.8 %). GUSTO moderate or severe/life threatening bleeding occurred significantly more often with \nearly routine eptifibatide (7.4 % vs. 5.0 % in delayed provisional eptifibatide group; p <0.001). Similar \ndifferences were noted for TIMI major haemorrhage (118 [2.5 %] in early routine use vs. 83 [1.8 %] in \ndelayed provisional use; p=0.016). \n \nNo statistically significant benefit of early routine eptifibatide strategy was demonstrated in the \nsubgroup of patients who were managed medically or during the medical management periods prior to \nPCI or CABG. \n \nIn a post hoc analysis of the EARLY ACS trial the risk benefit of dose reduction in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment is inconclusive. The primary endpoint event rate was 11.9 % in patients \nwho received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 11.2 % in patients who received the standard \ndose (2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early routine fashion (p=0.81). \nWith delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the event rates were 10 % vs 11.5 % in patients \nwho received reduced dose and standard dose respectively (p=0.61). TIMI major bleeding occurred in \n\n\n\n25 \n\n2.7 % of patients who received a reduced dose (1microgram/kg/min) vs 4.2 % of patients who \nreceived the standard dose (2 microgram/kg/min) when eptifibatide was administered in the early \nroutine fashion (p=0.36). With delayed provisional eptifibatide administration, the TIMI major events \nwere 1.4 % vs 2.0 % in patients who received reduced dose and standard dose respectively \n(p=0.54).There were no notable differences observed with GUSTO severe bleeding rates. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 \nto 250 microgram/kg and infusion rates from 0.5 to 3.0 microgram/kg/min.  \n \nDistrobution \nFor a 2.0 microgram/kg/min infusion, mean steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations range from \n1.5 to 2.2 microgram/ml in patients with coronary artery disease. These plasma concentrations are \nachieved rapidly when the infusion is preceded by a 180microgram/kg bolus.   \n \nBiotransformation \nThe extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25 %. In the same population, \nplasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours, plasma clearance 55 to 80 ml/kg/hr and \nvolume of distribution of approximately 185 to 260 ml/kg. \n \nElimination \nIn healthy subjects, renal excretion accounted for approximately 50 % of total body clearance; \napproximately 50 % of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged. In patients with moderate to severe \nrenal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min), the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by \napproximately 50 % and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled. \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted. However, in a population \npharmacokinetic study there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between eptifibatide \nand the following concomitant medicinal products: amlodipine, atenolol, atropine, captopril, cefazolin, \ndiazepam, digoxin, diltiazem, diphenhydramine, enalapril, fentanyl, furosemide, heparin, lidocaine, \nlisinopril, metoprolol, midazolam, morphine, nitrates, nifedipine, and warfarin. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology studies conducted with eptifibatide include single and repeated dose studies in the rat, \nrabbit and monkey, reproduction studies in the rat and rabbit, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity \nstudies, and irritation, hypersensitivity and antigenicity studies. No unexpected toxic effects for an \nagent with this pharmacologic profile were observed and findings were predictive of clinical \nexperience, with bleeding effects being the principal adverse event. No genotoxic effects were \nobserved with eptifibatide. \n \nTeratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant \nrats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human \ndose on a body surface area basis) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg/kg/day \n(about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis). These \nstudies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to eptifibatide. \n \nReproduction studies in animal species where eptifibatide shows a similar pharmacologic activity as in \nhumans are not available. Consequently these studies are not suitable to evaluate the toxicity of \neptifibatide on reproductive function (see section 4.6). \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide has not been evaluated in long-term studies. \n \n \n6.
