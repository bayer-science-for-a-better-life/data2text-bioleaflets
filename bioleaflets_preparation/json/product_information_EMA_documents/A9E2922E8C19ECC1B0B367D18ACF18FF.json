QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNuwiq 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 250 IU contains approximately 100 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nNuwiq 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 500 IU contains approximately 200 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nNuwiq 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 1000 IU contains approximately 400 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nNuwiq 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 2000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 2000 IU contains approximately 800 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nNuwiq 2500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 2500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 2500 IU contains approximately 1000 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nNuwiq 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 3000 IU contains approximately 1200 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nNuwiq 4000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 4000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), simoctocog alfa.  \nNuwiq 4000 IU contains approximately 1600 IU/mL of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), \nsimoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nThe potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. The specific \nactivity of Nuwiq is approximately 9500 IU/mg protein. \n \nSimoctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 1440 amino \nacids. The amino acid sequence is comparable to the 90 + 80 kDa form of human plasma factor VIII \n(i.e. B-domain deleted). Nuwiq is produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified \nhuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. No animal or human derived materials are added during \nthe manufacturing process or to the final medicinal product. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nExcipient with known effect \nOne mL of reconstituted solution contains 7.35 mg sodium (18.4 mg sodium per vial). \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection.  \n \nPowder: white to off-white friable powder. \n \nSolvent: a clear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII \ndeficiency). \nNuwiq can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the \ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \nresponse to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \nanalysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining \nfactor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly \naffected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can \nbe significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay \nand the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the \nlaboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. \n \nPosology \nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is \nrelated to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in \nplasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in \nInternational Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one \nmL of normal human plasma.  \n \nOn-demand treatment \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by \n\n\n\n4 \n\napproximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dL. The required dose is determined using the following \nformula:  \n \n\nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL) \n \n\nExpected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =   2 x administered IU \n   body weight (kg) \n\n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery. \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/  \nType of surgical procedure  \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ \nDuration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding  \n\n20–40 Repeat every 12 to 24 hours. At least \n1 day, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or healing \nis achieved.  \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma  \n\n30–60 Repeat infusion every 12 to 24 hours \nfor 3 to 4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved.  \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages  60–100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved.  \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor surgery  \nincluding tooth extraction  \n\n30–60 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved.  \n\nMajor surgery  80–100 \n(pre- and \n\npostoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8–24 hours until \nadequate wound healing, then therapy \nfor at least another 7 days to maintain a \nfactor VIII activity of 30% to \n60% (IU/dL).  \n\n \nProphylaxis \nFor long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are \n20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. The regimen may be adjusted \nbased on patient response. \n \nIn some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be \nnecessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe posology is the same in adults and children and adolescents, however, shorter dose intervals or \nhigher doses may be necessary for children and adolescents. Currently available data are described in \nsections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration \nNuwiq is for intravenous use. \nIt is recommended that not more than 4 mL per minute be administered. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAs with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Nuwiq \ncontains traces of human host cell proteins other than factor VIII. If symptoms of hypersensitivity \noccur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact \ntheir physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including \nhives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \nper mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the \nseverity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 \nexposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.  \n \nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.  \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nCardiovascular events  \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Nuwiq is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children and adolescents. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nExcipient related considerations (sodium content) \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial. \nHowever depending on the body weight and posology, the patient could receive more than one vial \n(see section 2 for information on content per vial). \nThis should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Nuwiq. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Nuwiq.  \nBased on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII \nduring pregnancy and breast feeding is not available. Therefore, Nuwiq should be used during \npregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. There are no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNuwiq has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angiooedema, burning and stinging at the \ninfusion site, chills, flushing, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, rash, restlessness, \ntachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, urticaria, including generalised urticaria, vomiting, \nwheezing) have rarely been observed with FVIII preparations and may in some cases progress to \nsevere anaphylaxis (including shock).  \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with Nuwiq. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an \ninsufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre \nbe contacted. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nDuring clinical studies with Nuwiq in previously treated paediatric (2 to 11 years, n = 58), adolescent \n(12 to 17 years, n = 3) and adult patients (n = 129) with severe haemophilia A, a total of 12 adverse \ndrug reactions (ADRs) (8 in adults, 4 in children) were reported in 8 patients (4 adults, 4 children). \n \nTable 1 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred \nTerm Level). \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1.

The \nsample was tested by the central laboratory at eight dilutions. The result was positive only at dilution \nfactor 1 and the antibody titre was very low. Inhibitory activity, as measured by the modified Bethesda \nassay, was not detected in this patient. Clinical efficacy and in vivo recovery of Nuwiq was not \naffected in this patient. \n \nPaediatric population \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children and adolescents are assumed to be the \nsame as in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, \nfactor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a \ncofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. \nActivated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin \nand a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due \nto decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal \norgans, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the \nplasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby temporarily enabling a correction of the factor VIII \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000134.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac0580022c59\n\n\n8 \n\n \nThe immunogenicity of Nuwiq was evaluated in clinical trials in 190 previously treated patients with \nsevere haemophilia A (129 adult and 61 paediatric patients). None of the patients developed inhibitors. \n \nAdult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of age \n \nProphylaxis: In a clinical study in 32 adult patients with severe haemophilia A, the median \nconsumption of Nuwiq for prophylaxis was 468.7 IU/kg/month. \n \nTreatment of bleeding: The median dose to treat break-through bleeding episodes was 33.0 IU/kg in \nthese patients who were on prophylaxis. In another clinical study, 22 adult patients were treated on \ndemand.  In total 986 bleeding episodes were treated with a median dose of 30.9 IU/kg. In general, \nminor bleeds required slightly lower, and more severe bleeds required up to three-fold higher median \ndoses. \n \nIndividualised prophylaxis: Individualised PK-based prophylaxis was evaluated in 66 adult PTPs with \nsevere haemophilia A. Following a 1-3 month standard prophylaxis phase (every other day or 3 times \nweekly dosing), 44 (67%) patients were switched to a dosing regimen based on their PK assessment, \nand 40 completed the 6 months of prophylaxis according to the assigned dosing and treatment scheme. \nOf these patients, 34 (85%) were treated twice weekly or less. 33 (82.5%) patients did not experience \nany bleeds and 36 (90.0%) patients had no spontaneous bleeds. The mean ± SD annualised bleeding \nrate was 1.2 ± 3.9 and the mean ± SD dose were 52.2 ± 12.2 IU/kg per injection and 99.7 ± 25.6 \nIU/kg per week.  \nOf note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and \nbetween different clinical studies. \n \nPaediatric population \nData have been obtained in 29 previously treated children between 2 and 5 years of age, 31 children \nbetween 6 and 12 years of age and one adolescent of 14 years. The median dose per prophylactic \ninfusion was 37.8 IU/kg. Twenty patients used median doses of more than 45 IU/kg. The median \nconsumption of Nuwiq for prophylaxis per month was 521.9 IU/kg. A higher median dose of Nuwiq \nwas required to treat bleedings in children (43.9 IU/kg) than in adults (33.0 IU/kg), and a higher \nmedian dose was required to treat moderate to major than minor bleedings (78.2 IU/kg vs. 41.7 IU/kg). \nYounger children in general required higher median doses (6-12 years: 43.9 IU/kg; 2-5 years: \n52.6 IU/kg). These data were corroborated by a long-term follow-up of 49 of these children who were \ntreated for an additional median period of approximately 30 months (range from 9.5 to 52 months); \nduring this period 45% of children had no spontaneous bleeds. \n \nA prospective open-label clinical study in PUPs with severe haemophilia A (<1% FVIII:C) is ongoing. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nNuwiq in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of haemophilia A (congenital \nfactor VIII deficiency) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAdult population  \n \nTable 2.

Once the medicinal product has been taken out of the refrigerator, it must not be \nreturned to the refrigerator. Please record the beginning of storage at room temperature on the product \ncarton. \n \nAfter reconstitution \nAfter reconstitution, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours when \nstored at room temperature. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after reconstitution. If \nnot used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser. \nKeep the reconstituted solution at room temperature. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C).  \nDo not freeze.  \nStore vial in the original package in order to protect from light.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nFor storage at room temperature and storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, \nsee section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nEach pack contains: \n\n- 1 powder vial with 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000 or 4000 IU simoctocog alfa in a type 1 \nglass vial, closed with coated bromobutyl stopper and sealed with aluminium flip-off cap \n\n- Solvent: 1 borosilicate pre-filled glass syringe containing 2.5 mL water for injections \n- 1 sterile vial adapter for reconstitution with 1 butterfly needle and 2 alcohol swabs  \n\n \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 mL water for injections) using \nthe supplied injection set. The vial should be gently rotated until all powder is dissolved. After \nreconstitution, the solution should be drawn back into the syringe.  \n \nThe reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted medicinal product is a clear, colourless \nsolution, free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.5.  Do not use solutions that are cloudy or \nhave deposits. \n \nInstructions for preparation and administration \n \n\n1. Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach \nroom temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as \nyour hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature \nshould be maintained during reconstitution. \n\n2. Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the \nrubber stopper. Do not remove the gray stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  \n\n \n3. Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  \n4. Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the \n\npackage.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n  \n5. Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the \n\nvial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press down firmly the \nadapter package until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps to the \nvial when done. \n\n \n6. Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end \n\nand do not touch the shaft. Attach the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe \nplunger. Turn the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. \n\n \n7. Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of \n\nthe cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. In case the solution is not used \nimmediately close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip for storage. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n8. Remove the adapter packaging and discard. \n9. Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is \n\nfelt. \n\n \n10. Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. \n\n \n11. Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve \n\nthe powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. \n12. Visually inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be \n\nclear and colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are \ncloudy or have deposits. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n13. Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the \nsyringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  \n\n \n14. Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the \n\nempty vial. \n15. The solution is now prepared for immediate use. Do not refrigerate. \n16. Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. \n17. Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. \n\nInsert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein. If you have used a tourniquet to make \nthe vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you start injecting the solution. \nNo blood must flow into the syringe due to the risk of formation of fibrin clots. \n\n18. Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 mL per minute. \n \nIf you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use the same injection needle \nagain. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements.  \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Nuwiq is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Nuwiq \n3. How to use Nuwiq \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Nuwiq  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Nuwiq is and what it is used for \n \nNuwiq contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (simoctocog alfa). \nFactor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleeding. In patients with haemophilia A \n(inborn factor VIII deficiency), factor VIII is missing or not working properly. \nNuwiq replaces the missing factor VIII and is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients \nwith haemophilia A and can be used for all age groups.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Nuwiq \n \nDo not use Nuwiq: \n\n• if you are allergic to the active substance simoctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of \nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before using Nuwiq. \n \nThere is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \nreaction) to Nuwiq. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions as they are listed in \nsection 4 “Allergic reactions”.  \nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. \n \nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \nall factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \n\n\n\n45 \n\nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \nyou or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with Nuwiq, tell your doctor immediately. \n \nCardiovascular events  \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that Nuwiq is administered, the name and batch number of \nthe product are recorded in order to maintain a link between you and the batch of the medicinal \nproduct. \n \n \nOther medicines and Nuwiq \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nNuwiq has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nNuwiq contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \nHowever, depending on your body weight and your dose of Nuwiq, you could receive more than one \nvial. This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use Nuwiq \n \nTreatment with Nuwiq will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with \nyour doctor or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nNuwiq is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or a nurse who are experienced in \nthe care of patients with haemophilia A. You or someone else might also give your Nuwiq injection, \nbut only after receiving adequate training. \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of Nuwiq (in international units = IU) depending on your \ncondition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. How \noften you need an injection will depend on how well Nuwiq is working for you. Usually, treatment for \nhaemophilia A is a life-long treatment. \n \nPrevention of bleeding \nThe usual dose of Nuwiq is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, given every 2 to 3 days. However, in \nsome cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nTreatment of bleeding \nThe dose of Nuwiq is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.  \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nIf you have the impression that the effect of Nuwiq is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor \nwill perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This \nis particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n \nPatients developing factor VIII inhibitors \nIf your plasma factor VIII fails to reach expected levels with Nuwiq, or if bleeding is not adequately \ncontrolled, it could be due to the development of factor VIII inhibitors. This will be checked by your \ndoctor. You might need a higher dose of Nuwiq or a different product to control bleedings. Do not \nincrease the total dose of Nuwiq to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nThe way Nuwiq is used in children and adolescents does not differ from the way it is used in adults. \nBecause factor VIII products may have to be given more often in children and adolescents, a central \nvenous access device (CVAD) may need to be fitted. A CVAD is an external connector that allows \naccess to the bloodstream through a catheter without injection through the skin. \n \nIf you use more Nuwiq than you should \nNo symptoms of overdose have been reported. If you have injected more Nuwiq than you should, \nplease inform your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to use Nuwiq \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately \nand continue as advised by your doctor. \n \nIf you stop using Nuwiq \nDo not stop using Nuwiq without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions \nYou should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions. If severe, sudden allergic reactions \n(anaphylactic) occur (very rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people), the injection must be stopped \nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms: \n \n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \nThese symptoms can be early symptoms of an anaphylactic shock. If any of these symptoms occur, \nstop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms require prompt emergency \ntreatment. \n \nVery common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people \nFactor VIII inhibition in previously untreated patients. \n \nFor children and adolescents not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies \n(see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients). \nHowever for patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 days of \ntreatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens, your or your child´s \n\n\n\n47 \n\nmedicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience persistent bleeding. If this \nhappens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n \nCommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people \nHypersensitivity, fever. \n \nUncommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 100 people \nTingling or numbness (paraesthesia), headache, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, back \npain, vertigo, dry mouth, dizziness, a vague feeling of bodily discomfort, shortness of breath, \nhaemorrhagic anaemia, non-neutralising antibody positive (in PTPs). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Nuwiq \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial label after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Store vial in the original package in order to protect \nfrom light. \n \nBefore the Nuwiq powder is reconstituted, it may be kept at room temperature (up to 25°C) for a \nsingle period not exceeding 1 month. Record the date from when you start to store Nuwiq at room \ntemperature on the product carton. Do not store Nuwiq in the refrigerator again after it has been stored \nat room temperature. \nUse the reconstituted solution immediately after reconstitution. \n \nDo not use the medicine in case you notice visible signs of deterioration of the tamper proof of \npackaging especially of the syringe and/or the vial. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

The following table can \nbe used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery. \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/  \nType of surgical procedure  \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) (IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ \nDuration of therapy (days)  \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding  \n\n20–40 Repeat every 12 to 24 hours. At least 1 \nday, until the bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or healing \nis achieved.  \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or haematoma  \n\n30–60 Repeat infusion every 12 to 24 hours \nfor 3 to 4 days or more until pain and \nacute disability are resolved.  \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages  60–100 Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours \nuntil threat is resolved.  \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor surgery  \nincluding tooth extraction  \n\n30–60 Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until \nhealing is achieved.  \n\nMajor surgery  80–100 \n(pre- and \n\npostoperative) \n\nRepeat infusion every 8–24 hours until \nadequate wound healing, then therapy \nfor at least another 7 days to maintain a \nfactor VIII activity of 30% to \n60% (IU/dL).  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n51 \n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION \n \n\n1. Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach \nroom temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as \nyour hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature \nshould be maintained during reconstitution. \n\n2. Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the \nrubber stopper. Do not remove the gray stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  \n\n \n3. Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  \n4. Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the \n\npackage.  \n\n  \n5. Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the \n\nvial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press down firmly the \nadapter package until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps to the \nvial when done. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n6. Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end \n\nand do not touch the shaft. Attach the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe \nplunger. Turn the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. \n\n \n7. Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of \n\nthe cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. In case the solution is not used \nimmediately close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip for storage. \n\n \n8. Remove the adapter packaging and discard. \n9. Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is \n\nfelt. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n10. Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. \n\n \n11. Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve \n\nthe powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. \n12. Visually inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be \n\nclear and colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are \ncloudy or have deposits. \n\n13. Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the \nsyringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  \n\n \n14. Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the \n\nempty vial. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n15. The solution is now prepared for immediate use. Do not refrigerate. \n16. Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. \n17. Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. \n\nInsert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein. If you have used a tourniquet to make \nthe vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you start injecting the solution. \nNo blood must flow into the syringe due to the risk of formation of fibrin clots. \n\n18. Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 mL per minute. \n \nIf you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use the same injection needle \nagain. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
