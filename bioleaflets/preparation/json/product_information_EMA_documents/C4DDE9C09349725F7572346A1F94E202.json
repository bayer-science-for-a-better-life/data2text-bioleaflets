NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nEntacapone Orion 200 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 200 mg entacapone.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach film-coated tablet contains 0.53 mg soya lecithin.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet)\n\nBrownish-orange, oval, biconvex film-coated tablet with \"COMT\" engraved on one side.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nEntacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/benserazide or \nlevodopa/carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor \nfluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nEntacapone should only be used in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa.\nThe prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is applicable to their concomitant use \nwith entacapone.\n\nPosology\n\nOne 200 mg tablet is taken with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose. The maximum \nrecommended dose is 200 mg ten times daily, i.e. 2,000 mg of entacapone.\n\nEntacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. Hence, to reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic \nadverse reactions, e.g. dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, it is often necessary to \nadjust levodopa dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment. The \ndaily dose of levodopa should be reduced by about 10-30% by extending the dosing intervals and/or \nby reducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the clinical condition of the patient.\n\nIf entacapone treatment is discontinued, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian \ntreatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian \nsymptoms.\n\nEntacapone increases the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide \npreparations slightly (5-10%) more than from standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Hence, \npatients who are taking standard levodopa/benserazide preparations may need a larger reduction of \nlevodopa dose when entacapone is initiated.\n\n\n\n3\n\nRenal impairment\nRenal insufficiency does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone and there is no need for dose \nadjustment. However, for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy, a longer dosing interval may \nbe considered (see section 5.2).\n\nHepatic impairment\nSee section 4.3.\n\nElderly\nNo dosage adjustment of entacapone is required for elderly.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Entacapone Orion in children below age 18 have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nEntacapone is administered orally and simultaneously with each levodopa/carbidopa or \nlevodopa/benserazide dose.\n\nEntacapone can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanut or soya or to any of the excipients listed \nin section 6.1.\n\n- Hepatic impairment.\n- Phaeochromocytoma.\n- Concomitant use of entacapone and non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) \n\ninhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine).\n- Concomitant use of a selective MAO-A inhibitor plus a selective MAO-B inhibitor and \n\nentacapone (see section 4.5).\n- A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic \n\nrhabdomyolysis.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nRhabdomyolysis secondary to severe dyskinesias or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been \nobserved rarely in patients with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nNMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, \nmyoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e.g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic \ndysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase. In \nindividual cases, only some of these symptoms and/or findings may be evident.\n\nNeither NMS nor rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with entacapone treatment from \ncontrolled trials in which entacapone was discontinued abruptly. Since the introduction into the \nmarket, isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or\ndiscontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medicinal products. When \nconsidered necessary, withdrawal of entacapone and other dopaminergic treatment should proceed \nslowly, and if signs and/or symptoms occur despite a slow withdrawal of entacapone, an increase in \nlevodopa dosage may be necessary.\n\nEntacapone therapy should be administered cautiously to patients with ischaemic heart disease.\n\nBecause of its mechanism of action, entacapone may interfere with the metabolism of medicinal \n\n\n\n4\n\nproducts containing a catechol group and potentiate their action. Thus, entacapone should be \nadministered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O-\nmethyl transferase (COMT), e.g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, \ndobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5).\n\nEntacapone is always given as an adjunct to levodopa treatment. Hence, the precautions valid for \nlevodopa treatment should also be taken into account for entacapone treatment. Entacapone increases \nthe bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/benserazide preparations 5-10% more than \nfrom standard levodopa/carbidopa preparations. Consequently, adverse dopaminergic reactions may \nbe more frequent when entacapone is added to levodopa/benserazide treatment (see also section 4.8). \nTo reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa \ndosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment, according to the \nclinical condition of the patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nEntacapone may aggravate levodopa-induced orthostatic hypotension. Entacapone should be given \ncautiously to patients who are taking other medicinal products which may cause orthostatic \nhypotension.\n\nIn clinical studies, undesirable dopaminergic effects, e.g. dyskinesia, were more common in patients \nwho received entacapone and dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), selegiline or amantadine \ncompared to those who received placebo with this combination. The doses of other antiparkinsonian \nmedicinal products may need to be adjusted when entacapone treatment is initiated.\n\nEntacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of \nsudden sleep onset in patients with Parkinson’s disease and caution should therefore be exercised \nwhen driving or operating machines (see also section 4.7).\n\nFor patients experiencing diarrhoea, a follow-up of weight is recommended in order to avoid \npotential excessive weight decrease. Prolonged or persistent diarrhoea appearing during use of\nentacapone may be a sign of colitis. In the event of prolonged or persistent diarrhoea, the medicinal \nproduct should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy and investigations considered.\n\nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients \nand carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge \neating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other \ndopaminergic treatments such as Entacapone Orion in association with levodopa. Review of \ntreatment is recommended if such symptoms develop.\n\nFor patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight decrease within a relatively \nshort period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be considered.\n\nEntacapone Orion contains soya lecithin. Patients who are hypersensitive to peanut or soya, should \nnot use this medicinal product.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction of entacapone with carbidopa has been observed with the recommended treatment \nschedule. Pharmacokinetic interaction with benserazide has not been studied.\n\nIn single-dose studies in healthy volunteers, no interactions were observed between entacapone and \nimipramine or between entacapone and moclobemide. Similarly, no interactions between entacapone\nand selegiline were observed in repeated-dose studies in parkinsonian patients. However, the \nexperience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A \ninhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, \nmaprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e.g. catechol-\n\n\n\n5\n\nstructured compounds: rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, \nalpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited. Caution should be exercised when \nthese medicinal products are used concomitantly with entacapone (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nEntacapone may be used with selegiline (a selective MAO-B inhibitor), but the daily dose of \nselegiline should not exceed 10 mg.\n\nEntacapone may form chelates with iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Entacapone and iron \npreparations should be taken at least 2-3 hours apart (see section 4.8).\n\nEntacapone binds to human albumin binding site II which also binds several other medicinal \nproducts, including diazepam and ibuprofen. Clinical interaction studies with diazepam and non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products have not been carried out. According to in vitro\nstudies, significant displacement is not anticipated at therapeutic concentrations of the medicinal \nproducts.\n\nDue to its affinity to cytochrome P450 2C9 in vitro (see section 5.2), entacapone may potentially \ninterfere with medicinal products with metabolism dependent on this isoenzyme, such as S-warfarin.\nHowever, in an interaction study with healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels \nof S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11–26%]. The INR \nvalues increased on average by 13% [CI90 6–19%]. Thus, control of INR is recommended when \nentacapone treatment is initiated for patients receiving warfarin.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nNo overt teratogenic or primary foetotoxic effects were observed in animal studies in which the \nexposure levels of entacapone were markedly higher than the therapeutic exposure levels. As there is \nno experience in pregnant women, entacapone should not be used during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIn animal studies entacapone was excreted in milk. The safety of entacapone in infants is unknown. \nWomen should not breast-feed during treatment with entacapone.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEntacapone Orion in association with levodopa may have a major influence on the ability to drive \nand use machines. Entacapone may, together with levodopa, cause dizziness and symptomatic \northostatism. Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines.\n\nPatients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence \nand/or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in \nactivities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death \n(e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most frequent adverse reactions caused by entacapone relate to the increased dopaminergic \nactivity and occur most commonly at the beginning of treatment. Reduction of levodopa dosage \ndecreases the severity and frequency of these reactions. The other major class of adverse reactions \nare gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation and \ndiarrhoea. Urine may be discoloured reddish-brown by entacapone, but this is a harmless \nphenomenon.\n\nUsually the adverse reactions caused by entacapone are mild to moderate. In clinical studies the most \n\n\n\n6\n\ncommon adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of entacapone treatment have been \ngastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, 2.5%) and increased dopaminergic adverse reactions of \nlevodopa (e.g. dyskinesias, 1.7%).\n\nDyskinesias (27%), nausea (11%), diarrhoea (8%), abdominal pain (7%) and dry mouth (4.2%) were \nreported significantly more often with entacapone than with placebo in pooled data from clinical \nstudies involving 406 patients taking the medicinal product and 296 patients taking placebo.\n\nSome of the adverse reactions, such as dyskinesia, nausea, and abdominal pain, may be more \ncommon with the higher doses (1,400 to 2,000 mg per day) than with the lower doses of entacapone.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe following adverse reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated both from clinical \nstudies with entacapone and since the introduction of entacapone into the market.\n\nTable 1. Adverse drug reactions*\n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nCommon: Insomnia, hallucinations, confusion, paroniria\n\nVery rare: Agitation\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nVery common: Dyskinesia\n\nCommon: Parkinsonism aggravated, dizziness, dystonia, hyperkinesia\n\nCardiac disorders**\n\nCommon: Ischaemic heart disease events other than myocardial\ninfarction (e.g. angina pectoris)\n\nUncommon: Myocardial infarction\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nVery common: Nausea\n\nCommon: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, constipation, vomiting\n\nVery rare: Anorexia\n\nNot known: Colitis\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\n\nRare: Hepatic function tests abnormal\n\nNot known: Hepatitis with mainly cholestatic features (see section 4.4.)\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nRare: Erythematous or maculopapular rash\n\nVery rare: Urticaria \n\nNot known: Skin, hair, beard and nail discolourations\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nVery common: Urine discoloration\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nCommon: Fatigue, sweating increased, fall\n\nVery rare: Weight decrease\n\n* Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the \nfollowing convention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot \nbe estimated from the available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials \nor epidemiological studies).\n\n\n\n7\n\n** The incidence rates of myocardial infarction and other ischaemic heart disease events (0.43% \nand 1.54%, respectively) are derived from an analysis of 13 double-blind studies involving \n2,082 patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations receiving entacapone.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nEntacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with isolated cases of excessive \ndaytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes.\n\nImpulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments such as Entacapone Orion in association with \nlevodopa (see section 4.4).\n\nIsolated cases of NMS have been reported following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of \nentacapone and other dopaminergic treatments.\n\nIsolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe post-marketing data include isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily dose of \nentacapone has been 16,000 mg. The acute symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included \nconfusion, decreased activity, somnolence, hypotonia, skin discolouration and urticaria. Management \nof acute overdose is symptomatic.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: N04BX02.\n\nEntacapone belongs to a new therapeutic class, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. It \nis a reversible, specific, and mainly peripherally acting COMT inhibitor designed for concomitant \nadministration with levodopa preparations. Entacapone decreases the metabolic loss of levodopa to \n3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) by inhibiting the COMT enzyme. This leads to a higher levodopa AUC. \nThe amount of levodopa available to the brain is increased. Entacapone thus prolongs the clinical \nresponse to levodopa.\n\nEntacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme mainly in peripheral tissues. COMT inhibition in red blood \ncells closely follows the plasma concentrations of entacapone, thus clearly indicating the reversible \nnature of COMT inhibition.\n\nClinical studies\nIn two phase III double-blind studies in a total of 376 patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-\ndose motor fluctuations, entacapone or placebo was given with each levodopa/dopa decarboxylase \ninhibitor dose. The results are given in Table 2. In study I, daily ON time (hours) was measured from \nhome diaries and in study II, the proportion of daily ON time.\n\nTable 2.

The corresponding figures in study II were –18% and –5%.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nGeneral characteristics of the active substance\n\nAbsorption\nThere are large intra- and interindividual variations in the absorption of entacapone.\n\nThe peak concentration (Cmax) in plasma is usually reached about one hour after ingestion of a \n200 mg entacapone tablet. The substance is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. The \nbioavailability of entacapone is about 35% after an oral dose. Food does not affect the absorption of \nentacapone to any significant extent.\n\nDistribution\nAfter absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, entacapone is rapidly distributed to the peripheral \ntissues with a distribution volume of 20 litres at steady state (Vdss). Approximately 92 % of the dose \nis eliminated during ß-phase with a short elimination half-life of 30 minutes. The total clearance of \nentacapone is about 800 ml/min.\n\nEntacapone is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin. In human plasma the \nunbound fraction is about 2.0% in the therapeutic concentration range. At therapeutic concentrations, \nentacapone does not displace other extensively bound substances (e.g. warfarin, salicylic acid, \nphenylbutazone, or diazepam), nor is it displaced to any significant extent by any of these substances\nat therapeutic or higher concentrations.\n\nBiotransformation\nA small amount of entacapone, the (E)-isomer, is converted to its (Z)-isomer. The (E)-isomer \naccounts for 95% of the AUC of entacapone. The (Z)-isomer and traces of other metabolites account \nfor the remaining 5%.\n\nData from in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations indicate that entacapone \ninhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 (IC50 4 µM). Entacapone showed little or no inhibition of other types \nof P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP2C19) (see section \n4.5).\n\nElimination\nThe elimination of entacapone occurs mainly by non-renal metabolic routes. It is estimated that 80-\n90% of the dose is excreted in faeces, although this has not been confirmed in man. Approximately \n\n\n\n9\n\n10-20% is excreted in urine. Only traces of entacapone are found unchanged in urine. The major part \n(95%) of the product excreted in urine is conjugated with glucuronic acid. Of the metabolites found \nin urine only about 1% have been formed through oxidation.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of entacapone are similar in both young people and elderly. The \nmetabolism of the medicinal product is slowed in patients with mild to moderate liver insufficiency \n(Child-Pugh Class A and B), which leads to an increased plasma concentration of entacapone in both \nthe absorption and elimination phases (see section 4.3). Renal impairment does not affect the \npharmacokinetics of entacapone. However, a longer dosing interval may be considered for patients \nwho are receiving dialysis therapy.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. In repeated dose \ntoxicity studies, anaemia most likely due to iron chelating properties of entacapone was observed. \nRegarding reproduction toxicity, decreased foetal weight and a slightly delayed bone development \nwere noticed in rabbits at systemic exposure levels in the therapeutic range.\n\n6.
