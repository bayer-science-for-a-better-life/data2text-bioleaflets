NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCircadin 2 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 2 mg melatonin. \nExcipient with known effect: each prolonged-release tablet contains 80 mg lactose monohydrate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet. \n \nWhite to off-white, round, biconvex tablets \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCircadin is indicated as monotherapy for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia characterised \nby poor quality of sleep in patients who are aged 55 or over. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 2 mg once daily, 1-2 hours before bedtime and after food.  This dosage may \nbe continued for up to thirteen weeks. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Circadin in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established. \nOther pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this population. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of any stage of renal impairment on melatonin pharmacokinetics has not been studied.  \nCaution should be used when melatonin is administered to such patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no experience of the use of Circadin in patients with liver impairment.  Published data \ndemonstrates markedly elevated endogenous melatonin levels during daytime hours due to decreased \nclearance in patients with hepatic impairment.  Therefore, Circadin is not recommended for use in \npatients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nOral use.  Tablets should be swallowed whole to maintain prolonged release properties.  Crushing or \nchewing should not be used to facilitate swallowing. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCircadin may cause drowsiness.  Therefore the product should be used with caution if the effects of \ndrowsiness are likely to be associated with a risk to safety. \n \nNo clinical data exist concerning the use of Circadin in individuals with autoimmune diseases.  \nTherefore, Circadin is not recommended for use in patients with autoimmune diseases. \n \nCircadin contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the LAPP \nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \n• Melatonin has been observed to induce CYP3A in vitro at supra-therapeutic \n\nconcentrations.  The clinical relevance of the finding is unknown.  If induction occurs, \nthis can give rise to reduced plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered \nmedicinal products. \n\n• Melatonin does not induce CYP1A enzymes in vitro at supra-therapeutic \nconcentrations.  Therefore, interactions between melatonin and other active substances \nas a consequence of melatonin’s effect on CYP1A enzymes are not likely to be \nsignificant. \n\n• Melatonin’s metabolism is mainly mediated by CYP1A enzymes.  Therefore, \ninteractions between melatonin and other active substances as a consequence of their \neffect on CYP1A enzymes is possible. \n\n• Caution should be exercised in patients on fluvoxamine, which increases melatonin \nlevels (by 17-fold higher AUC and a 12-fold higher serum Cmax) by inhibiting its \nmetabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.  \nThe combination should be avoided. \n\n• Caution should be exercised in patients on 5- or 8-methoxypsoralen (5 and 8-MOP), \nwhich increases melatonin levels by inhibiting its metabolism. \n\n• Caution should be exercised in patients on cimetidine a CYP2D inhibitor, which increases \nplasma melatonin levels, by inhibiting its metabolism. \n\n• Cigarette smoking may decrease melatonin levels due to induction of CYP1A2. \n• Caution should be exercised in patients on oestrogens (e.g. contraceptive or hormone \n\nreplacement therapy), which increase melatonin levels by inhibiting its metabolism by \nCYP1A1 and CYP1A2. \n\n• CYP1A2 inhibitors such as quinolones may give rise to increased melatonin exposure. \n• CYP1A2 inducers such as carbamazepine and rifampicin may give rise to reduced \n\nplasma concentrations of melatonin. \n• There is a large amount of data in the literature regarding the effect of adrenergic \n\nagonists/antagonists, opiate agonists/antagonists, antidepressant medicinal products, \nprostaglandin inhibitors, benzodiazepines, tryptophan and alcohol, on endogenous \nmelatonin secretion.  Whether or not these active substances interfere with the dynamic \nor kinetic effects of Circadin or vice versa has not been studied. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \n• Alcohol should not be taken with Circadin, because it reduces the effectiveness of \n\nCircadin on sleep. \n• Circadin may enhance the sedative properties of benzodiazepines and \n\nnon-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone.  In a clinical \ntrial, there was clear evidence for a transitory pharmacodynamic interaction between \nCircadin and zolpidem one hour following co-dosing.  Concomitant administration \nresulted in increased impairment of attention, memory and co-ordination compared to \nzolpidem alone. \n\n• Circadin has been co-administered in studies with thioridazine and imipramine, active \nsubstances which affect the central nervous system.  No clinically significant \npharmacokinetic interactions were found in each case.  However, Circadin \nco-administration resulted in increased feelings of tranquility and difficulty in \nperforming tasks compared to imipramine alone, and increased feelings of “muzzy-\nheadedness” compared to thioridazine alone. \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor melatonin, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.  Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, \nparturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).  In view of the lack of clinical data, use in  \npregnant women and by women intending to become pregnant is not recommended. \n \nBreastfeeding \nEndogenous melatonin was measured in human breast milk thus exogenous melatonin is probably \nsecreted into human milk.  There are data in animal models including rodents, sheep, bovine and \nprimates that indicate maternal transfer of melatonin to the foetus via the placenta or in the milk.  \nTherefore, breast-feeding is not recommended in women under treatment with melatonin. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCircadin has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Circadin may cause \ndrowsiness, therefore the product should be used with caution if the effects of drowsiness are likely to \nbe associated with a risk to safety. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn clinical trials (in which a total of 1,931 patients were taking Circadin and 1,642 patients were \ntaking placebo), 48.8% of patients receiving Circadin reported an adverse reaction compared with \n37.8% taking placebo.  Comparing the rate of patients with adverse reactions per 100 patient weeks, \nthe rate was higher for placebo than Circadin (5.743– placebo vs. 3.013– Circadin).  The most \ncommon adverse reactions were headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and arthralgia, which were \ncommon, by MedDRA definition, in both the Circadin and placebo treated groups. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials and from post-marketing spontaneous \nreporting. \nIn clinical trials a total of 9.5% of patients receiving Circadin reported an adverse reaction compared \nwith 7.4% of patients taking placebo.  Only those adverse reactions reported during clinical trials \noccurring in patients at an equivalent or greater rate than placebo have been included below. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nVery common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be established from the \navailable data). \n \nSystem Organ \n\nClass \nVery \n\nCommon \nCommon Uncommon Rare Not known:  \n\n(Cannot be \nestablished \n\nfrom the \navailable data) \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n   Herpes zoster  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\n   Leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n    Hyper-\nsensitivity \nreaction \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders \n\n   Hypertriglyceridaemia, \nhypocalcaemia, \nhyponatraemia \n\n \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  Irritability, \nnervousness, \nrestlessness, \ninsomnia, abnormal \ndreams, nightmares, \nanxiety \n\nMood altered, \naggression, agitation, \ncrying, stress \nsymptoms, \ndisorientation, early \nmorning awakening, \nlibido increased, \ndepressed mood, \ndepression \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n  Migraine, headache, \nlethargy, \npsychomotor \nhyperactivity, \ndizziness, \nsomnolence \n\nSyncope, memory \nimpairment, \ndisturbance in \nattention, dreamy state, \nrestless legs syndrome, \npoor quality sleep, \nparaesthesia \n\n \n\nEye disorders    Visual acuity reduced, \nvision blurred, \nlacrimation increased  \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n   Vertigo positional, \nvertigo \n\n \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n   Angina pectoris, \npalpitations \n\n \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n  Hypertension Hot flush  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare Not known:  \n(Cannot be \nestablished \n\nfrom the \navailable data) \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n  Abdominal pain, \nabdominal pain \nupper,  dyspepsia, \nmouth ulceration, \ndry mouth, nausea \n\nGastro-oesophageal \nreflux disease, \ngastrointestinal \ndisorder, oral mucosal \nblistering, tongue \nulceration, \ngastrointestinal upset, \nvomiting, bowel \nsounds abnormal, \nflatulence, salivary \nhypersecretion, \nhalitosis, abdominal \ndiscomfort, gastric \ndisorder, gastritis  \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\n  Hyperbilirubinaemia   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Dermatitis, night \nsweats, pruritus, \nrash, pruritus \ngeneralised, dry skin \n\nEczema, erythema, \nhand dermatitis, \npsoriasis, rash \ngeneralised, rash \npruritic, nail disorder  \n\nAngioedema, \noedema of \nmouth, tongue \noedema \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n  Pain in extremity Arthritis, muscle \nspasms, neck pain, \nnight cramps \n\n \n\nRenal and \nurinary disorders \n\n  Glycosuria, \nproteinuria \n\nPolyuria, haematuria, \nnocturia \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorders \n\n  Menopausal \nsymptoms \n\nPriapism, prostatitis Galactorrhoea \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n  Asthenia, chest pain  Fatigue, pain, thirst  \n\nInvestigations   Liver function test \nabnormal, weight \nincreased \n\nHepatic enzyme \nincreased, blood \nelectrolyes abnormal, \nlaboratory test \nabnormal \n\n \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSeveral cases of overdose have been reported post-marketing. Somnolence was the most reported \nadverse event. Most were mild to moderate in severity. Circadin has been administered at 5 mg daily \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\ndoses in clinical trials over 12 months without significantly changing the nature of the adverse \nreactions reported. \n \nAdministration of daily doses of up to 300 mg of melatonin without causing clinically significant \nadverse reactions have been reported in the literature. \n \nIf overdose occurs, drowsiness is to be expected.  Clearance of the active substance is expected within \n12 hours after ingestion.  No special treatment is required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Psycholeptics, melatonin receptor agonists, ATC code: N05CH01 \n \nMelatonin is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the pineal gland and is structurally related to \nserotonin.  Physiologically, melatonin secretion increases soon after the onset of darkness, peaks at \n2-4 am and diminishes during the second half of the night.  Melatonin is associated with the control of \ncircadian rhythms and entrainment to the light-dark cycle.  It is also associated with a hypnotic effect \nand increased propensity for sleep. \n \nMechanism of action \nThe activity of melatonin at the MT1, MT2 and MT3 receptors is believed to contribute to its \nsleep-promoting properties, as these receptors (mainly MT1 and MT2) are involved in the regulation \nof circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. \n \nRationale for use \nBecause of the role of melatonin in sleep and circadian rhythm regulation, and the age related \ndecrease in endogenous melatonin production, melatonin may effectively improve sleep quality \nparticularly in patients who are over 55 with primary insomnia. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn clinical trials, where patients suffering from primary insomnia received Circadin 2 mg every \nevening for 3 weeks, benefits were shown in treated patients compared to placebo in sleep latency (as \nmeasured by objective and subjective means) and in subjective quality of sleep and daytime \nfunctioning (restorative sleep) with no impairment of vigilance during the day. \n \nIn a polysomnographic (PSG) study with a run-in of 2 weeks (single-blind with placebo treatment), \nfollowed by a treatment period of 3 weeks (double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design) \nand a 3-week withdrawal period, sleep latency (SL) was shortened by 9 minutes compared to placebo.  \nThere were no modifications of sleep architecture and no effect on REM sleep duration by Circadin.  \nModifications in diurnal functioning did not occur with Circadin 2 mg. \n \nIn an outpatient study with 2 week run-in baseline period with placebo, a randomised, double blind, \nplacebo controlled, parallel group treatment period of 3 weeks and 2 week withdrawal period with \nplacebo, the rate of patients who showed a clinically significant improvement in both quality of sleep \nand morning alertness was 47% in the Circadin group as compared to 27% in the placebo group.  In \naddition, quality of sleep and morning alertness significantly improved with Circadin compared to \nplacebo.  Sleep variables gradually returned to baseline with no rebound, no increase in adverse \nreactions and no increase in withdrawal symptoms. \n \nIn a second outpatient study with two week run in baseline period with placebo and a randomised, \ndouble blind, placebo controlled, parallel group treatment period of 3 weeks, the rate of patients who \nshowed a clinically significant improvement in both quality of sleep and morning alertness was 26% \nin the Circadin group as compared to 15% in the placebo group.  Circadin shortened patients’ reported \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsleep latency by 24.3 minutes vs 12.9 minutes with placebo.  In addition, patients’ self-reported \nquality of sleep, number of awakenings and morning alertness significantly improved with Circadin \ncompared to placebo.  Quality of life was improved significantly with Circadin 2 mg compared to \nplacebo. \n \nAn additional randomised clinical trial (n=600) compared the effects of Circadin and placebo for up \nto six months. Patients were re-randomised at 3 weeks. The study demonstrated improvements in \nsleep latency, quality of sleep and morning alertness, with no withdrawal symptoms and rebound \ninsomnia. The study showed that the benefit observed after 3 weeks is maintained for up to 3 months \nbut failed the primary analysis set at 6 months. At 3 months, about an extra 10% of responders were \nseen in the Circadin treated group. \n \nPaediatric population \nA Paediatric study (n=125) with doses of 2, 5 or 10 mg prolonged-release melatonin in multiples of \n1 mg minitablets (age-appropriate pharmaceutical form), with two week run in baseline period on \nplacebo and a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group treatment period of \n13 weeks, demonstrated an improvement in total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of double-blind \ntreatment; participants slept more with active treatment (508 minutes), compared to placebo \n(488 minutes). \n \nThere was also a reduction in sleep latency with active treatment (61 minutes) compared to placebo \n(77 minutes) after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, without causing earlier wake-up time. \n \nIn addition, there were fewer dropouts in the active treatment group (9 patients; 15.0%) compared to \nthe placebo group (21 patients; 32.3%). Treatment emergent adverse events were reported by 85% \npatients in the active group and by 77% in the placebo group. Nervous system disorders were more \ncommon in the active group with 42% patients, compared to 23% in the placebo group, mainly driven \nby somnolence and headache more frequent in the active group. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nThe absorption of orally ingested melatonin is complete in adults and may be decreased by up to 50% \nin the elderly.  The kinetics of melatonin are linear over the range of 2-8 mg. \n \nBioavailability is in the order of 15%.  There is a significant first pass effect with an estimated first \npass metabolism of 85%.  Tmax occurs after 3 hours in a fed state.  The rate of melatonin absorption \nand Cmax following Circadin 2 mg oral administration is affected by food.  The presence of food \ndelayed the absorption of the melatonin resulting in a later (Tmax=3.0 h versus Tmax=0.75 h) and lower \npeak plasma concentration in the fed state (Cmax=1020pg/ml versus Cmax=1176 pg/ml). \n \nDistribution \nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of melatonin is approximately 60%.  Circadin is mainly bound to \nalbumin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein and high density lipoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation \nExperimental data suggest that isoenzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and possibly CYP2C19 of the \ncytochrome P450 system are involved in melatonin metabolism.  The principal metabolite is \n6-sulphatoxy-melatonin (6-S-MT), which is inactive.  The site of biotransformation is the liver.  The \nexcretion of the metabolite is completed within 12 hours after ingestion. \n \nElimination \nTerminal half life (t½) is 3.5-4 hours.  Elimination is by renal excretion of metabolites, 89% as \nsulphated and glucoronide conjugates of 6-hydroxymelatonin and 2% is excreted as melatonin \n(unchanged active substance). \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nGender \nA 3-4-fold increase in Cmax is apparent for women compared to men.  A five-fold variability in Cmax \nbetween different members of the same sex has also been observed.  However, no pharmacodynamic \ndifferences between males and females were found despite differences in blood levels. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nOlder People \nMelatonin metabolism is known to decline with age.  Across a range of doses, higher AUC and Cmax \nlevels have been reported in older patients compared to younger patients, reflecting the lower \nmetabolism of melatonin in the elderly.  Cmax  levels around 500 pg/ml in adults (18-45) versus \n1200 pg/ml in elderly (55-69); AUC levels around 3,000 pg*h/mL in adults versus 5,000 pg*h/mL in \nthe elderly. \n \nRenal impairment \nCompany data indicates that there is no accumulation of melatonin after repeated dosing.  This \nfinding is compatible with the short half-life of melatonin in humans. \nThe levels assessed in the blood of the patients at 23:00 (2 hours after administration) following 1 and \n3 weeks of daily administration were 411.4 ± 56.5 and 432.00 ± 83.2 pg/ml respectively, and are \nsimilar to those found in in healthy volunteers following a single dose of Circadin 2 mg. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe liver is the primary site of melatonin metabolism and therefore, hepatic impairment results in \nhigher endogenous melatonin levels. \nPlasma melatonin levels in patients with cirrhosis were significantly increased during daylight hours.  \nPatients had a significantly decreased total excretion of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin compared with controls. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of \nthe maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nThe carcinogenicity study in the rat did not reveal any effect which may be relevant for humans. \n \nIn reproductive toxicology, oral administration of melatonin in pregnant female mice, rats or rabbits \ndid not result in adverse effects on their offspring, measured in terms of foetal viability, skeletal and \nvisceral abnormalities, sex ratio, birthweight and subsequent physical, functional and sexual \ndevelopment.  A slight effect on post-natal growth and viability was found in rats only at very high \ndoses, equivalent to approximately 2000 mg/day in humans. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPackage Leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nCircadin 2 mg prolonged-release tablets \nMelatonin \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See Section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Circadin is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Circadin \n3. How to take Circadin \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Circadin \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Circadin is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance of Circadin, melatonin, belongs to a natural group of hormones produced by the \nbody. \n \nCircadin is used on its own for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia (persistent difficulty in \ngetting to sleep or staying asleep, or poor quality of sleep) in patients aged 55 years and older. \n‘Primary’ means that the insomnia does not have any identified cause, including any medical, mental \nor environmental cause. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Circadin \n \nDo not take Circadin \n- if you are allergic to melatonin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Circadin. \n \n- If you suffer from liver or kidney problems. No studies on the use of Circadin in people with \n\nliver or kidney diseases have been performed, you should speak to your doctor before taking \nCircadin as its use is not recommended. \n\n- If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars. \n- If you have been told you suffer from an autoimmune disease (where the body is ‘attacked’ by \n\nits own immune system). No studies on the use of Circadin in people with auto-immune \ndiseases have been performed; therefore, you should speak to your doctor before taking \nCircadin as its use is not recommended. \n\n- Circadin can make you feel drowsy, you should be careful if the drowsiness affects you as it \nmay impair your ability on tasks such as driving. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n- Smoking may make Circadin less effective, because the components of tobacco smoke can \nincrease the breakdown of melatonin by the liver. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children between the ages of 0 to 18 years as it has not been tested and \nits effects are unknown. Another medicine containing melatonin may be more appropriate for \nadministration to children between the ages of 2 to 18 - please ask your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice. \n \nOther medicines and Circadin \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  These medicines include: \n \n− Fluvoxamine (used for the treatment of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder), \n\npsoralens (used in the treatment of skin disorders e.g. psoriasis), cimetidine (used in the \ntreatment of stomach problems such as ulcers), quinolones and rifampicin (used in the \ntreatment of bacterial infections), oestrogens (used in contraceptives or hormone replacement \ntherapy) and carbamazepine (used in the treatment of epilepsy). \n\n− Adrenergic agonists/antagonists (such as certain types of medicines used to control blood \npressure by constricting blood vessels, nasal decongestants, blood pressure lowering \nmedicines), opiate agonists/antagonists (such as medicinal products used in the treatment of \ndrug addiction), prostaglandin inhibitors (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines), \nantidepressant medication, tryptophan and alcohol. \n\n− Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (medicines used to induce sleep such as \nzaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone) \n\n− Thioridazine (for the treatment of schizophrenia) and imipramine (for the treatment of \ndepression). \n\n \nCircadin with food, drink and alcohol \nTake Circadin after you have eaten.  Do not drink alcohol before, during or after taking Circadin, \nbecause it reduces the effectiveness of Circadin. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not take Circadin if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, trying to become pregnant or \nbreast-feeding.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCircadin may cause drowsiness.  If you are affected, you should not drive or operate machinery.  If \nyou suffer from continued drowsiness, then you should consult your doctor. \n \nCircadin contains lactose monohydrate. \nCircadin contains lactose monohydrate.  If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Circadin \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one Circadin tablet (2 mg) taken daily by mouth, after food, 1-2 hours \nbefore bedtime. This dosage may be continued for up to thirteen weeks. \n \nYou should swallow the tablet whole.  Circadin tablets should not be crushed or cut in half. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf you take more Circadin than you should \nIf you have accidentally taken too much of your medicine, contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon \nas possible. \n \nTaking more than the recommended daily dose may make you feel drowsy. \n \nIf you forget to take Circadin \nIf you forget to take your tablet, take another as soon as you remember, before going to sleep, or wait \nuntil it is time to take your next dose, then go on as before. \n \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Circadin \nThere are no known harmful effects if treatment is interrupted or ended early.  The use of Circadin is \nnot known to cause any withdrawal effects after treatment completion. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
