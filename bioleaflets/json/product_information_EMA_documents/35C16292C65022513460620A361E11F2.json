NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPazenir 5 mg/ml powder for dispersion for infusion. \n \n \n2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound \nnanoparticles.  \n \nAfter reconstitution, each ml of dispersion contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin \nbound nanoparticles. \n \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3.  PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for dispersion for infusion. \n \nThe reconstituted dispersion has a pH of 6-7.5 and an osmolality of \n300-360 mOsm/kg. The powder is white to yellow. \n \n \n4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1  Therapeutic indications \n \nPazenir monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in adult patients \nwho have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline \ncontaining therapy is not indicated (see section 4.4). \n \nPazenir in combination with gemcitabine is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with \nmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. \n \nPazenir in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell \nlung cancer in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation \ntherapy. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration \n \nPazenir should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units \nspecialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents. It should not be substituted for or with other \npaclitaxel formulations. \n \nPosology \n \nBreast cancer \nThe recommended dose of Pazenir is 260 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 \nweeks. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment of breast cancer \nPatients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer) \nor severe sensory neuropathy during Pazenir therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/m2 for \n\n\n\n3 \n \n \n\nsubsequent courses. Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, \nadditional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/m2. Pazenir should not be administered until \nneutrophil counts recover to >1500 cells/mm3. For Grade 3 sensory neuropathy, withhold treatment \nuntil resolution to Grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses. \n \nPancreatic adenocarcinoma \nThe recommended dose of Pazenir in combination with gemcitabine is 125 mg/m2 administered \nintravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The concurrent \nrecommended dose of gemcitabine is 1000 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes \nimmediately after the completion of Pazenir administration on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day \ncycle. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n \nTable 1: Dose level reductions for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nDose level Pazenir dose (mg/m2) Gemcitabine dose (mg/m2) \nFull dose 125 1000 \n1st dose level reduction 100 800 \n\n2nd dose level reduction 75 600 \nIf additional dose \nreduction required \n\n \nDiscontinue treatment \n\n \nDiscontinue treatment \n\n \nTable 2: Dose modifications for neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia at the start of a cycle \nor within a cycle for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nCycle \nDay \n\nANC count \n(cells/mm3)  \n\nPlatelet count \n(cells/mm3) Pazenir Dose \n\nGemcitabine \nDose \n\nDay 1 < 1500 OR < 100,000 Delay doses until recovery \n\nDay 8 ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 Reduce doses 1 dose level \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \n\nDay 15: If Day 8 doses were given without modification: \n\nDay 15 ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 \n\nTreat with Day 8 dose level and follow \nwith WBC Growth Factors \n\nOR \nReduce doses 1 dose level from \n\nDay 8 doses \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \n\nDay 15: If Day 8 doses were reduced: \n\nDay 15 ≥ 1000 AND ≥ 75,000 \nReturn to the Day 1 dose levels and \nfollow with WBC Growth Factors \nORTreat with same doses as Day 8 \n\n ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 \n\nTreat with Day 8 dose levels and follow \nwith WBC Growth Factors \n\nOR \nReduce doses 1 dose level from \n\nDay 8 doses \n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \n\n\n\n4 \n \n \n\nDay 15: If Day 8 doses were withheld: \n\nDay 15 ≥ 1000 AND ≥ 75,000 \n\nReturn to Day 1 dose levels and follow \nwith WBC Growth Factors \n\nOR \nReduce doses 1 dose level from  \n\nDay 1 doses \n\n ≥ 500 but < 1000 OR ≥ 50,000 but < 75,000 \n\nReduce 1 dose level and follow with \nWBC Growth Factors \n\nOR \nReduce doses 2 dose levels from \n\nDay 1 doses \n\n < 500 OR < 50,000 Withhold doses \nAbbreviations: ANC=Absolute Neutrophil Count; WBC=white blood cell \n \nTable 3: Dose modifications for other adverse drug reactions in patients with \npancreatic adenocarcinoma \n\nAdverse Drug Reaction \n(ADR) Pazenir Dose Gemcitabine Dose \n\nFebrile Neutropenia: \nGrade 3 or 4 \n\nWithhold doses until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500; resume at \nnext lower dose levela \n\nPeripheral Neuropathy: \nGrade 3 or 4 \n\nWithhold dose until improves to \n≤ Grade 1; \n\nresume at next lower dose levela \nTreat with same dose \n\nCutaneous Toxicity: \nGrade 2 or 3 \n\nReduce to next lower dose levela; \ndiscontinue treatment if ADR persists \n\nGastrointestinal \nToxicity: \n\nGrade 3 mucositis or \ndiarrhoea \n\nWithhold doses until improves to ≤ Grade 1; \nresume at next lower dose levela \n\naSee Table 1 for dose level reductions \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nThe recommended dose of Pazenir is 100 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over \n30 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of carboplatin is \nAUC = 6 mg•min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, beginning immediately after the end of \nPazenir administration. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment of non-small cell lung cancer \nPazenir should not be administered on Day 1 of a cycle until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is \n≥1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count is ≥100,000 cells/mm3. For each subsequent weekly dose of \nPazenir, patients must have an ANC ≥500 cells/mm3 and platelets >50,000 cells/mm3 or the dose is to \nbe withheld until counts recover. When counts recover, resume dosing the following week according \nto the criteria in Table 4. Reduce subsequent dose only if criteria in Table 4 are met. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n \n\nTable 4: Dose reductions for haematologic toxicities in patients with non-small cell lung cancer \nHaematologic Toxicity Occurrenc\n\ne \nDose of Pazenir  \n\n(mg/m2)1 \nDose of \n\ncarboplatin \n(AUC mg•min/mL\n\n)1 \nNadir ANC <500/mm3 with \nneutropenic \nfever > 38°C \n\nO\nR \n\nDelay of next cycle due to \npersistent neutropenia2 (Nadir \nANC <1500/mm3) \n\nO\nR \n\nNadir ANC <500/mm3 for > 1 week \n\nFir\nst \n\n7\n5 \n\n4\n.\n5 \n\nSecond 5\n0 \n\n3\n.\n0 \n\nThird Discontinue Treatment \n\nNadir platelets <50,000/mm3 Fir\nst \n\n7\n5 \n\n4\n.\n5 \n\nSecond Discontinue Treatment \n1On Day 1 of the 21-day cycle reduce the dose of Pazenir and carboplatin simultaneously.

On Days 8 or 15 of the 21-day \ncycle reduce the dose of Pazenir; reduce the dose of carboplatin in the subsequent cycle. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nFor patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 x ULN and aspartate \naminotransferase [AST] ≤ 10 x ULN), no dose adjustments are required, regardless of indication. Treat \nwith same doses as patients with normal hepatic function. \n \nFor metastatic breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients with moderate to severe \nhepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN), a 20% reduction in dose \nis recommended. The reduced dose may be escalated to the dose for patients with normal hepatic \n\n\n\n6 \n \n \n\nfunction if the patient is tolerating the treatment for at least two cycles (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that have moderate to severe hepatic \nimpairment, there are insufficient data to permit dosage recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nFor patients with total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN, there are insufficient data to permit \ndosage recommendations regardless of indication (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nAdjustment of the starting Pazenir dose is not required for patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min). There are insufficient data available to \nrecommend dose modifications of Pazenir in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal \ndisease (estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 5.2). \n \nElderly \nNo additional dosage reductions, other than those for all patients, are recommended for patients 65 \nyears and older. \n \nOf the 229 patients in the randomized study who received human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles monotherapy for breast cancer, 13% were at least 65 years of age and < 2% were 75 \nyears and older. No toxicities occurred notably more frequently among patients at least 65 years of age \nwho received human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. However, a subsequent analysis in 981 \npatients receiving human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles monotherapy for metastatic breast \ncancer, of which 15% were ≥ 65 years old and 2% were ≥ 75 years old, showed a higher incidence of \nepistaxis, diarrhoea, dehydration, fatigue and peripheral oedema in patients ≥ 65 years. \n \nOf the 421 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the randomized study who received human \nserum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in combination with gemcitabine, 41% were 65 years and \nolder and 10% were 75 years and older. In patients aged 75 years and older who received human \nserum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles and gemcitabine, there was a higher incidence of serious \nadverse reactions and adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). Patients \nwith pancreatic adenocarcinoma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed before treatment \nis considered (see section 4.4). \n \nOf the 514 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the randomized study who received human \nserum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in combination with carboplatin, 31% were 65 years or older \nand 3.5% were 75 years or older. Myelosuppression events, peripheral neuropathy events, and \narthralgia were more frequent in patients 65 years or older compared to patients younger than 65 years \nof age. There is limited experience of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/carboplatin use \nin patients 75 years or older. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data from 125 patients with advanced solid \ntumours indicates that patients ≥ 65 years of age may be more susceptible to development of \nneutropenia within the first treatment cycle. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in children and adolescents \naged 0 to less than 18 years has not been established. Currently available data are described in section \ns 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. There is no relevant use of \nhuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in the paediatric population for the indication of \nmetastatic breast cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \nPazenir is for intravenous use. Reconstituted Pazenir dispersion should be administered intravenously \nusing an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter. Following administration, it is recommended that \nthe intravenous line be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure \n\n\n\n7 \n \n \n\nadministration of the complete dose. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3  Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1.  \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \nPatients who have baseline neutrophil counts <1500 cells/mm3. \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPazenir is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially \ndifferent pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel (see sections 5.1 \nand 5.2). It should not be substituted for or with other paclitaxel formulations. \n \nHypersensitivity \nRare occurrences of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including very rare events of anaphylactic \nreactions with fatal outcome, have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the medicinal \nproduct should be discontinued immediately, symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the \npatient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel. \n \nHaematology \nBone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) occurs frequently with human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles. Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity. Frequent \nmonitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Pazenir therapy. Patients should not be \nretreated with subsequent cycles of Pazenir until neutrophils recover to >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets \nrecover to >100,000 cells/mm3 (see section 4.2). \n \nNeuropathy \nSensory neuropathy occurs frequently with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles, \nalthough development of severe symptoms is less common. The occurrence of Grade 1 or 2 sensory \nneuropathy does not generally require dose reduction. When Pazenir is used as monotherapy, if \nGrade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, treatment should be withheld until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 \nfollowed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Pazenir is recommended (see section \n4.2). For combination use of Pazenir and gemcitabine, if Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy \ndevelops, withhold Pazenir; continue treatment with gemcitabine at the same dose. Resume Pazenir \nat reduced dose when peripheral neuropathy improves to Grade 0 or 1 (see section 4.2). For \ncombination use of Pazenir and carboplatin, if Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy develops, \ntreatment should be withheld until improvement to Grade 0 or 1 followed by a dose reduction for \nall subsequent courses of Pazenir and carboplatin (see section 4.2). \n \nSepsis \nSepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received Pazenir in \ncombination with gemcitabine. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially \nbiliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. If a \npatient becomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum \nantibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, withhold Pazenir and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ \n1500 cells/mm3, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels (see section 4.2). \n \nPneumonitis \nPneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients when human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles was \nused as monotherapy and in 4% of patients when Pazenir was used in combination with \ngemcitabine. Closely monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. After ruling out \n\n\n\n8 \n \n \n\ninfectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue \ntreatment with Pazenir and gemcitabine and promptly initiate appropriate treatment and supportive \nmeasures (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nBecause the toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic impairment, administration of Pazenir \nin patients with hepatic impairment should be performed with caution. Patients with hepatic \nimpairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression; such patients \nshould be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression. \n \nPazenir is not recommended in patients that have total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN. In \naddition, Pazenir is not recommended in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas \nthat have moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x \nULN) (see section 5.2). \n \nCardiotoxicity \nRare reports of congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been observed among \nindividuals receiving human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. Most of the individuals were \npreviously exposed to cardiotoxic medicinal products such as anthracyclines, or had underlying \ncardiac history. Thus, patients receiving Pazenir should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the \noccurrence of cardiac events. \n \nCentral nervous system metastases \nThe effectiveness and safety of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in patients with \ncentral nervous system (CNS) metastases has not been established. CNS metastases are generally \nnot well controlled by systemic chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal symptoms \nIf patients experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Pazenir, they \nmay be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents. \n \nPatients 75 years and older \nFor patients of 75 years and older, no benefit for the combination treatment of Pazenir and \ngemcitabine in comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy has been demonstrated. In the very elderly \n(≥75 years) who received Pazenir and gemcitabine, there was a higher incidence of serious adverse \nreactions and adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation including haematologic toxicities, \nperipheral neuropathy, decreased appetite and dehydration. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \naged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate Pazenir in combination \nwith gemcitabine with special consideration to performance status, co-morbidities and increased risk \nof infections (see section 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nOther \nAlthough limited data is available, no clear benefit in terms of prolonged overall survival has been \ndemonstrated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with normal CA 19-9 levels prior to start of \ntreatment with Pazenir and gemcitabine (see section 5.1). \n \nErlotinib should not be co-administered with Pazenir plus gemcitabine (see section 4.5). \n \nExcipients \nWhen reconstituted, Pazenir concentrate contains 4.2 mg of sodium per ml. To be taken into \nconsideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n \n\n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and \nCYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, in the absence of a PK drug-drug interaction study, caution \nshould be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicinal products known to \ninhibit either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, \nfluoxetine, gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) \nbecause toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering \npaclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be \ncompromised because of lower paclitaxel exposures. \n \nPaclitaxel and gemcitabine do not share a common metabolic pathway. Paclitaxel clearance is \nprimarily determined by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary \nexcretion, while gemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase followed by urinary excretion. \nPharmacokinetic interactions between Pazenir and gemcitabine have not been evaluated in humans. \n \nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles and \ncarboplatin in non-small cell lung cancer patients. There were no clinically relevant \npharmacokinetic interactions between human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticlesand \ncarboplatin. \n \nPazenir is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer, in combination with gemcitabine for \npancreatic adenocarcinoma, or in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer (see \nsection 4.1). Pazenir should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nContraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and up to 1 \nmonth after receiving treatment with Pazenir. Male patients treated with Pazenir are advised to use \neffective contraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to six months after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy. Paclitaxel is suspected to \ncause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy \ntest prior to starting treatment with Pazenir. Pazenir should not be used in pregnancy, and in women \nof childbearing potential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical condition of the \nmother requires treatment with paclitaxel. \n \nBreast-feeding \nPaclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). It is \nnot known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk. Because of potential serious adverse reactions in \nbreast-feeding infants, Pazenir is contraindicated during lactation.  Breast-feeding must be \ndiscontinued for the duration of therapy. \n \nFertility \nHuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles induced infertility in male rats (see section 5.3). \nBased on findings in animals, male and female fertility may be compromised. Male patients should \nseek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible \ninfertility due to therapy with Pazenir. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n \n\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPaclitaxel has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Paclitaxel may \ncause adverse reactions such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the \nability to drive and use machinery. Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they \nfeel tired or dizzy. \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common clinically significant adverse reactions associated with the use of human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles have been neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia/myalgia \nand gastrointestinal disorders. \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions associated with the administration of human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles are listed in Table 6 (human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles as \nmonotherapy) and Table 7 (human serum albumin-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine), and \nTable 9 (human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in combination with carboplatin). \n \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000).

Grade 4 \nneutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 9% of patients treated with human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles. Febrile neutropenia occurred in four patients on human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles. Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl) was observed in 46% of patients on human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles, and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dl) in three cases. Lymphopenia was \nobserved in 45% of the patients. \n \nNervous system disorders \nIn general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was dose-dependent in patients \nreceiving human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade \n1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) was observed in 68% of patients on human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticleswith 10% being Grade 3, and no cases of Grade 4. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nNausea occurred in 29% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAlopecia was observed in >80% of the patients treated with human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles. The majority of alopecia events occurred less than one month after initiation of \nhuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. Pronounced hair loss ≥50% is expected for the \nmajority of patients who experience alopecia. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nArthralgia occurred in 32% of patients on human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles and was \nsevere in 6% of cases. Myalgia occurred in 24% of patients on human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles and was severe in 7% of cases. The symptoms were usually transient, typically occurred \nthree days after human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles administration and resolved within a \nweek. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nAsthenia/Fatigue was reported in 40% of the patients. \n \nPancreatic adenocarcinoma (Pazenir administered in combination with gemcitabine) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions were assessed in 421 patients treated with human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles in combination with gemcitabine and 402 gemcitabine monotherapy-treated patients \nreceiving first-line systemic treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in a phase III \nrandomized, controlled, open-label trial.

Of the patients with \ntreatment interrupted due to peripheral neuropathy, 44% (31/70 patients) were able to resume human \nserum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticlesat a reduced dose. No patients treated with human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticlesin combination with gemcitabine had Grade 4 peripheral \nneuropathy. \n \nSepsis \nSepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticlesin combination with gemcitabine during the conduct of a trial in \npancreatic adenocarcinoma. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary \nobstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. If a patient \nbecomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. \nFor febrile neutropenia, withhold Pazenir and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500 \ncells/mm3, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n16 \n \n \n\n \nPneumonitis \nPneumonitis has been reported at a rate of 4% with the use of human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticlesin combination with gemcitabine.

Using repeated measure analysis, 3 of the 4 \nsubscales (peripheral neuropathy, pain hands/feet, and hearing) favored human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles and carboplatin (p ≤ 0.002). For the other subscale (oedema), there was no \ndifference in the treatment arms. \n \nPost-marketing experience \nCranial nerve palsies, vocal cord paresis, and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have \nbeen reported during post-marketing surveillance of human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles. \n \nThere have been rare reports of reduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular oedema during \ntreatment with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. Upon diagnosis of cystoid macular \noedema, treatment with Pazenir should be discontinued. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n \n\n \nThere have been reports of tumour lysis syndrome during treatment with human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles. \n \nScleroderma of the skin has been reported. In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine, \nreports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing \nsurveillance of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles. Because these events have been \nreported voluntarily during clinical practice, true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal \nrelationship to the events has not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe study consisted of 106 patients, 104 of whom were paediatric patients aged from 6 months to less \nthan 18 years (see section 5.1). Every patient experienced at least 1 adverse reaction. The most \nfrequently reported adverse reactions were neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia and pyrexia. Serious \nadverse reactions reported in more than 2 patients were pyrexia, back pain, peripheral oedema and \nvomiting. No new safety signals were identified in the limited number of paediatric patients treated \nwith human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles and the safety profile was similar to that of the \nadult population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose \n \nThere is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient \nshould be closely monitored. Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, \nwhich are bone marrow suppression, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy. \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, \ntaxanes, ATC Code: L01CD01 \n \nMechanism of action \nPaclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin \ndimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the \ninhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital \ninterphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” \nof microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis. \n \nPazenir contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles of approximately 130 nm in size, \nwhere the paclitaxel is present in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. Upon intravenous \nadministration, the nanoparticles dissociate rapidly into soluble, albumin bound paclitaxel complexes \nof approximately 10 nm in size. Albumin is known to mediate endothelial caveolar transcytosis of \nplasma constituents, and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances \ntransport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells. It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial \ncaveolar transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is enhanced \naccumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein Secreted Protein \nAcidic Rich in Cysteine (SPARC). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n \n \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBreast cancer \nData from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated \nin a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in metastatic breast cancer. This information is presented below. \n \nSingle-arm open-label studies \nIn one study, human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles were administered as a 30-minute \ninfusion at a dose of 175 mg/m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer. The second trial \nutilised a dose of 300 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer. \nPatients were treated without steroid pre-treatment or planned G-CSF support. Cycles were \nadministered at 3- week intervals. The response rates in all patients were 39.5% (95% CI: 24.9%-\n54.2%) and 47.6% (95% CI: 35.3%-60.0%), respectively. The median time to disease progression \nwas 5.3 months (175 mg/m2; 95% CI: 4.6-6.2 months) and 6.1 months (300 mg/m2; 95% CI: 4.2-9.8 \nmonths). \n \nRandomised comparative study \nThis multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every \n3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour \ninfusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles 260 mg/m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229). \nSixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had \nvisceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases. Fourteen percent of the patients had not \nreceived prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the \nmetastatic setting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings. Fifty-nine percent received \nstudy medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy. Seventy-seven percent of the \npatients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines. \n \nResults for overall response rate and time to disease progression, and progression-free survival and \nsurvival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy, are shown below. \n \nTable 10: Results for overall response rate, median time to disease progression, \nand progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator \n\nEfficacy variable \nhuman serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles \n(260 mg/m2) \n\nSolvent-based paclitaxel \n(175 mg/m2) p-value \n\nResponse rate [95% CI] (%) \n> 1st-line therapy 26.5 [18.98, 34.05] (n = 132) 13.2 [7.54, 18.93] (n = 136) 0.006a \n\n*Median time to disease progression [95% CI] (weeks) \n> 1st-line therapy 20.9 [15.7, 25.9] (n = 131) 16.1 [15.0, 19.3] (n = 135) 0.011b \n\n*Median progression free survival [95% CI] (weeks) \n\n\n\n20 \n \n \n\n> 1st-line therapy 20.6 [15.6, 25.9] (n = 131) 16.1 [15.0, 18.3] (n = 135) 0.010b \n\n*Survival [95% CI] (weeks) \n> 1st-line therapy 56.4 [45.1, 76.9] (n = 131) 46.7 [39.0, 55.3] (n = 136) 0.020b \n\n*This data is based on Clinical Study Report: CA012-0 Addendum dated Final (23 March-2005) \na Chi-squared test \nb Log-rank test \n \nTwo hundred and twenty nine patients treated with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in \nthe randomized, controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety. Neurotoxicity to paclitaxel was \nevaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing Grade 3 peripheral \nneuropathy at any time during therapy. The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to \nbaseline due to cumulative toxicity of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles after > 6 \ncourses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown. \n \nPancreatic adenocarcinoma \nA multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study was conducted in 861 patients to compare \nhuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy as first-\nline treatment in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles were administered to patients (N = 431) as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 \nminutes at a dose of 125 mg/m2 followed by gemcitabine as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 \nminutes at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In the comparator \ntreatment arm, gemcitabine monotherapy was administered to patients (N = 430) in accordance with \nthe recommended dose and regimen. Treatment was administered until disease progression or \ndevelopment of an unacceptable toxicity. Of the 431 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who \nwere randomized to receive human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in combination with \ngemcitabine, the majority (93%) were white, 4% were black and 2% were Asian. 16% had a \nKarnofsky Performance Status of 100; 42% had a KPS of 90; 35% had a KPS of 80; 7% had a KPS of \n70; and <1% of patients had a KPS of below 70. Patients with high cardiovascular risk, history of \nperipheral artery disease and/or of connective tissue disorders and/or interstitial lung disease were \nexcluded from the study. \n \nPatients received a median treatment duration of  3.9 months in the human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles/gemcitabine arm and 2.8 months in the gemcitabine arm. 32% of patients in the human \nserum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine arm compared with 15% of patients in the \ngemcitabine arm received 6 or more months of treatment. For the treated population, the median \nrelative dose intensity for gemcitabine was 75% in the human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles/gemcitabine arm and 85% in the gemcitabine arm. The median relative dose intensity of \nhuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles was 81%. A higher median cumulative dose of \ngemcitabine was delivered in the human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine arm \n(11400 mg/m2) when compared with the gemcitabine arm (9000 mg/m2). \n\n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS). The key secondary endpoints were \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), both assessed by independent, \ncentral, blinded radiological review using RECIST guidelines (Version 1.0). \n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n \n\nTable 11: Efficacy results from randomized study in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \n(Intent-to-treat population) \n Human serum albumin-paclitaxel \n\nnanoparticles \n(125 mg/m2)/gemcitabine \n\n(N=431) \n\nGemcitabine \n(N=430) \n\nOverall Survival \nNumber of deaths (%) 333(77) 359 (83) \nMedian Overall \nSurvival, \nmonths (95% CI) \n\n8.5 (7.89, 9.53) 6.7 (6.01, 7.23) \n\n  HRA+G/G(95% Cl)a 0.72 (0.617, 0.835) \nP-valueb <0.0001 \nSurvival Rate % (95% \nCI) at \n\n  \n\n1 Year 35% (29.7, 39.5) 22% (18.1, 26.7) \n2 Year 9% (6.2, 13.1) 4% (2.3, 7.2) \n\n75th Percentile Overall \nSurvival (months) 14.8 11.4 \n\nProgression-free Survival \nDeath or progression, \nn (%) \n\n277 (64) 265 (62) \n\nMedian Progression-\nfree \nSurvival, months (95% \nCI) \n\n5.5 (4.47, 5.95) 3.7 (3.61, 4.04) \n\nHRA+G/G (95%Cl)a 0.69 (0.581, 0.821) \nP-valueb <0.0001 \nOverall Response Rate \nConfirmed complete or \npartial overall response, \nn (%) \n\n99 \n(23) 31 (7) \n\n95% CI 19.1,27.2 5.0, 10.1 \npA+G/pG(95% Cl) 3.19 (2.178, 4.662) \nP-value (chi-square \ntest) \n\n<0.0001 \n\nCI = confidence interval, HRA+G/G = hazard ratio of Paclitaxel human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles+gemcitabine/gemcitabine, pA+G/pG=response rate ratio of human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles+gemcitabine/gemcitabine \na stratified Cox proportional hazard model \nb stratified log-rank test, stratified by geographic region (North America versus others), KPS (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), and \npresence of liver metastasis (yes versus no). \n \nThere was a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients treated with human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone, with 1.8 months increase in \nmedian OS, 28% overall reduction in risk of death, 59% improvement in 1-year survival, and 125% \nimprovement in 2-year survival rates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n \n\nPr\nop\n\nor\ntio\n\nn \nof\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival (intent-to-treat population) \n \n\nTime (months) \n \nTreatment effects on OS favoured the human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine \narm across the majority of pre-specified subgroups (including gender, KPS, geographic region, \nprimary location of pancreatic cancer, stage at diagnosis, presence of liver metastases, presence of \nperitoneal carcinomatosis, prior Whipple procedure, presence of  biliary stent at baseline, presence \nof pulmonary metastases, and number of metastatic sites). For patients ≥ 75 years of age in the \nhuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arms the survival \nHazard Ratio (HR) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.653, 1. 797). For patients with normal baseline CA 19-9 \nlevels the survival HR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.692, 1.661). \n \nThere was a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients treated with human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone, with 1.8 months increase in \nmedian PFS. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nA multicenter, randomized, open-label study was conducted in 1052 chemotherapy-naive patients with \nStage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The study compared human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles in combination with carboplatin versus solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with \ncarboplatin as first-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Over 99% of \npatients had an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients \nwith pre-existing neuropathy of Grade ≥ 2  or serious medical risk factors involving any of the major \norgan systems were excluded. Human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles were administered to \npatients (N=521) as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and \n15 of each 21-day cycle without any steroid premedication and without granulocyte colony stimulating \nfactor prophylaxis. Beginning immediately after the end of human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles administration, carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg•min/mL was administered \nintravenously on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle. Solvent- based paclitaxel was administered to \npatients (N=531) at a dose of 200 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours with standard \npremedication, immediately followed by carboplatin administered intravenously at AUC = \n6 mg•min/mL. Each medicinal product was administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

Patients in the human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/carboplatin arm had a significantly higher overall response rate \ncompared with patients in the control arm: 33% versus 25%, p = 0.005 (Table 12). There was a \nsignificant difference in overall response rate in the human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles/carboplatin arm compared to the control arm in patients with non-small cell lung \ncancer of squamous histology (N=450, 41% vs. 24%, p<0.001), however this difference did not \ntranslate into a difference in PFS or OS. There was no difference in ORR between the treatment \narms in patients with non-squamous histology (N=602, 26% vs 25%, p=0.808). \n \nTable 12: Overall response rate in randomized non-small cell lung cancer trial (intent-\nto-treat population) \n\nEfficacy Parameter \n\nHuman serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel \n\nnanoparticles \n(100mg/m2/week) + \n\ncarboplatin \n(N=521) \n\nSolvent-based paclitaxel \n(200 mg/m2 every 3 \n\nweeks) + carboplatin \n(N=531) \n\nOverall Response Rate (independent review)   \nConfirmed complete or partial overall reponse, n \n(%) \n\n170 (33%) 132 (25%) \n\n95% Cl (%) 28.6, 36.7 21.2, 28.5 \nPA/pT (95.1% Cl) 1.313 (1.082, 1.593) \nP-valuea 0.005 \n\nCI = confidence interval; HRA/T = hazard ratio of Human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/carboplatin to solvent-\nbased paclitaxel/carboplatin; pA/pT = response rate ratio of Human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles/carboplatin to \nsolvent-based paclitaxel/carboplatin. \na P-value is based on a chi-square test. \n \nThere was no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (by blinded radiologist \nassessment) and overall survival between the two treatment arms. A non-inferiority analysis was \nconducted for PFS and OS, with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 15%.

Of the 42 patients, 1 patient was < 2, 27 were aged ≥ 2 to < 12, 12 were aged ≥12 to < 18 and \n2 adult patients were aged ≥ 18 to 24 years old. \n \nPatients were treated for a median of 2 cycles at the MTD. From the 41 patients eligible for efficacy \nevaluation in stage 1, 1 patient in the rhabdomyosarcoma group (N=14) had a confirmed partial \nresponse (PR) resulting in an ORR of 7.1% (95% CI:  0.2, 33.9). No confirmed complete response \n(CR) or PR was observed in either the Ewing’s sarcoma group (N=13) or the neuroblastoma group \n(N=14). None of the study arms continued into stage 2 because the protocol-defined requirement of ≥ \n2 patients to have a confirmed response was not met.  \n \nThe median overall survival results, including the 1-year follow-up period were 32.1 weeks (95% CI: \n21.4, 72.9), 32.0 weeks (95% CI: 12, not established) and 19.6 weeks (95% CI: 4, 25.7) for the \nEwing’s sarcoma, neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma groups, respectively. \n \nThe overall safety profile of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in paediatric patients \nwas consistent with the known safety profile of human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles in \nadults (see section 4.8). Based on these results, it was concluded that human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles as monotherapy does not have meaningful clinical activity or survival \nbenefit that warrants further development in the paediatric population \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of human serum \nalbumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m2 were determined in clinical studies. \nThe paclitaxel exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.hr/ml following dosing from \n80 to 300 mg/m2. \n\n \nIn a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel \nfollowing human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles administered intravenously at 260 mg/m2 \nover 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel \ninjection administered over 3 hours. Based on non-compartmental PK analysis, the plasma clearance \nof paclitaxel with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles was larger (43%) than that following \na solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher (53%). There were \nno differences in terminal half-lives. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n \n\nIn a repeat dose study with 12 patients receiving human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles \nadministered intravenously at 260 mg/m2, intra-patient variability in AUC was 19% (range = 3.21%-\n37.70%). There was no evidence for accumulation of paclitaxel with multiple treatment courses. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles administration to patients with solid \ntumours, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to \nplasma proteins (94%). \n \nThe protein binding of paclitaxel following human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles was \nevaluated by ultrafiltration in a within-patient comparison study. The fraction of free paclitaxel was \nsignificantly higher with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles (6.2%) than with solvent-\nbased paclitaxel (2.3%). This resulted in significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with \nhuman serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, even though \nthe total exposure is comparable. This is possibly due to paclitaxel not being trapped in Cremophor \nEL micelles as with solvent-based paclitaxel. Based on the published literature, in vitro studies of \nbinding to human serum proteins, (using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 µg/ml), \nindicate that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not \naffect protein binding of paclitaxel. \n \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the total volume of distribution is approximately \n1741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue \nbinding of paclitaxel. \n \nBiotransformation and elimination \nBased on the published literature, in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show \nthat paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, 3’-p-\nhydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel. The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites \nis catalysed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes, respectively. \n \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30-minute infusion of human serum albumin-\npaclitaxel nanoparticles at 260 mg/m2, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged \nactive substance accounted for 4% of the total administered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites \n6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating extensive non-renal clearance. Paclitaxel \nis principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. \n \nAt the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m2, the mean plasma clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 \nto 30 L/h/m2, and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on population pharmacokinetics of human serum albumin-paclitaxel \nnanoparticles was studied in patients with advanced solid tumours. This analysis included patients \nwith normal hepatic function (n=130), and pre-existing mild (n=8), moderate (n=7), or severe (n=5) \nhepatic impairment (according to NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria). The results show \nthat mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN) has no clinically important effect on \npharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤3 x ULN) or severe \n(total bilirubin >3 to ≤5 x ULN) hepatic impairment have a 22% to 26% decrease in the maximum \nelimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in mean paclitaxel AUC compared with \npatients with normal hepatic function. Hepatic impairment has no effect on mean paclitaxel Cmax. In \naddition, elimination of paclitaxel shows an inverse correlation with total bilirubin and a positive \ncorrelation with serum albumin. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that there is no correlation between hepatic \nfunction (as indicated by the baseline albumin or total bilirubin level) and neutropenia after \nadjusting for human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles exposure. \n\n\n\n26 \n \n \n\n \nPharmacokinetic data are not available for patients with total bilirubin >5 x ULN or for patients \nwith metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis included patients with normal renal function (n=65), and pre-\nexisting mild (n=61), moderate (n=23), or severe (n=l) renal impairment (according to draft FDA \nguidance criteria 2010). Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min) \nhas no clinically important effect on the maximum elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and \nCmax) of paclitaxel. Pharmacokinetic data are insufficient for patients with severe renal impairment \nand not available for patients with end stage kidney disease. \n \nElderly \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis for human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles included \npatients with ages ranging from 24 to 85 years old and shows that age does not significantly influence \nthe maximum elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. \n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data from 125 patients with advanced solid \ntumours indicates that patients ≥ 65 years of age may be more susceptible to development of \nneutropenia within the first treatment cycle, although the plasma paclitaxel exposure is not affected \nby age. \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following 30 minutes of intravenous administration at dose levels \nof 120 mg/m2 to 270 mg/m2 were determined in 64 patients (2 to ≤ 18 years) in Phase 1 of a Phase 1/2 \nstudy in recurrent or refractory paediatric solid tumours. Following dosing increase from 120 to 270 \nmg/m2, the paclitaxel mean AUC(0-inf) and Cmax ranged from 8867 to 14361 ng*hr/ml and from 3488 to \n8078 ng/ml, respectively. \n \nDose normalized peak drug exposure values were comparable across the dose range studied; however, \ndose-normalized total drug exposure values were only comparable across 120 mg/m2 to 240 mg/m2; \nwith lower dose-normalized AUC∞ at the 270 mg/m2 dose level. At the MTD of 240 mg/m2, the mean \nCL was 19.1 L/h and the mean terminal half-life was 13.5 hours. \n \nIn children and adolescent patients, exposure to paclitaxel increased with higher dosing and weekly \ndrug exposures were higher than in adult patients. \n \nOther intrinsic factors \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses for human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles indicate that \ngender, race (Asian vs. White), and type of solid tumours do not have a clinically important effect on \nsystemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. Patients weighing 50 kg had paclitaxel AUC \napproximately 25% lower than those weighing 75 kg. The clinical relevance of this finding is \nuncertain. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied. However, based on the published \nliterature, paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses, based upon \nits pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro \n(chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel \nhas been shown to be genotoxic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice), but it did not induce \nmutagenicity in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl \ntransferase (CHO/HGPRT) gene mutation assay. \n \nPaclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility when \n\n\n\n27 \n \n \n\nadministered prior and during mating in male and female rats and foetal toxicity in rats. Animal \nstudies with human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles showed non-reversible, toxic effects on \nthe male reproductive organs at clinically relevant exposure levels. \n \nPaclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Following intravenous \nadministration of radiolabelled paclitaxel to rats on days 9 to 10 postpartum, concentrations of \nradioactivity in milk were higher than in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma \nconcentrations. \n \n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions \nare the responsibility of the user. \n \nStability of the reconstituted dispersion in the infusion bag \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C, \nprotected from light followed by 4 hours at 15°C-25°C. From a microbiological point of view, \nunless the method of opening/reconstituting/dilution precludes the risks of microbial \ncontamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use \nstorage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nUnopened vials \nThis medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. Keep the \ncontainer in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely \naffects the stability of the product.  \n \nReconstituted dispersion \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n50 ml vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (butyl rubber), with an overseal (aluminium), containing \n100 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. \n \nPack size of one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nPreparation and administration precautions \nPaclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, \ncaution should be exercised in handling Pazenir. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is \nrecommended. If the dispersion contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and \nthoroughly with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed \nthoroughly with water. Pazenir should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately \ntrained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Pazenir. \n \nGiven the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for \npossible infiltration during administration of the medicinal product. Limiting the infusion of \nPazenir to 30 minutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions. \n \nReconstitution and administration of the product \nPazenir is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use. After \nreconstitution, each ml of dispersion contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound \nnanoparticles. \n \nUsing a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should \nslowly be injected into a vial of Pazenir over a minimum of 1 minute. \n \nThe solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial. The solution should not be \ninjected directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. \n \nOnce the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to \nensure proper wetting of the solid. Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/or inverted \nfor at least 2 minutes until complete redispersion of any powder occurs. The generation of foam must \nbe avoided. If foaming or clumping occurs, the solution must stand for at least 15 minutes until foam \nsubsides. \n \nThe reconstituted dispersion should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates. Some \nsettling of the reconstituted dispersion may occur. If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial \nshould be gently inverted again to ensure complete redispersion prior to use. Inspect the dispersion \nin the vial for particulate matter. Do not administer the reconstituted dispersion if particulate matter \nis observed in the vial. \n \nThe exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml dispersion required for the patient should be calculated and \nthe appropriate amount of reconstituted Pazenir should be injected into an empty, sterile, PVC or \nnon-PVC type intravenous bag. \n \nThe use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to \nreconstitute and administer Pazenir may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Administer \nPazenir using an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use \nof a 15 µm filter removes strands and does not change the physical or chemical properties of the \nreconstituted product. \n \nUse of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may result in blockage of the filter. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n \n\nThe use of specialized di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)-free solution containers or administration \nsets is not necessary to prepare or administer Pazenir infusions. \n \nFollowing administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Pazenir is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Pazenir \n3. How to use Pazenir \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Pazenir \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.  What Pazenir is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Pazenir is \nPazenir contains, as its active substance, paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin, in the form \nof tiny particles known as nanoparticles. Paclitaxel belongs to a group of medicines called “taxanes” \nused in cancer. \n• Paclitaxel is the part of the medicine that affects the cancer, it works by stopping cancer cells \n\nfrom dividing – this means that they die. \n• Albumin is the part of the medicine that helps paclitaxel dissolve in the blood and get \n\nacross the walls of the blood vessels into the tumour. This means that other chemicals that \ncan cause side effects that can be life threatening are not needed. Such side effects occur \nfar less with Pazenir. \n\n \nWhat Pazenir is used for \nPazenir is used to treat the following types of cancer: \n \nBreast cancer \n• Breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body (this is called “metastatic” breast \n\ncancer). \n• Pazenir is used in metastatic breast cancer when at least one other therapy has been tried but has \n\nnot worked and you are unsuitable for treatments containing a group of medicines called \n“anthracyclines”. \n\n• People with metastatic breast cancer who received paclitaxel attached to the human protein \nalbumin where another therapy had failed, were more likely to experience a reduction in \ntumour size, and lived longer than people who took an alternative therapy. \n\n \nPancreatic cancer \n• Pazenir is used together with a medicine called gemcitabine if you have metastatic cancer of \n\nthe pancreas. People with metastatic pancreatic cancer (pancreatic cancer that has spread to \nother parts of the body) who received paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin with \n\n\n\n42 \n \n \n\ngemcitabine in a clinical trial lived longer than people who had only received gemcitabine. \n \nLung cancer \n• Pazenir is also used together with a medicine called carboplatin if you have the most common \n\ntype of lung cancer, called “non-small cell lung cancer”. \n• Pazenir is used in non-small cell lung cancer where surgery or radiotherapy would not \n\nbe suitable to treat the disease. \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you use Pazenir \n \nDo not use Pazenir \n• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients of Pazenir (listed \n\nin section 6); \n• if you are breast-feeding; \n• if you have a low white blood cell count (baseline neutrophil counts <1500 cells/mm3 - your \n\ndoctor will advise you on this). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before using Pazenir \n• if you have poor kidney function; \n• if you have severe liver problems; \n• if you have heart problems. \n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse if you experience any of these conditions whilst being treated with \nPazenir, your doctor may wish to stop treatment or reduce the dose: \n• if you experience any abnormal bruising, bleeding, or signs of infections such as a sore \n\nthroat or a fever; \n• if you experience numbness, tingling, pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle \n\nweakness; \n• if you experience breathing problems, like shortness of breath or dry cough. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents aged below 18 \nyears. \n \nOther medicines and Pazenir  \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes \nmedicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because Pazenir can \naffect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way Pazenir \nworks. \n \nTake care and speak to your doctor when taking Pazenir at the same time as any of the following: \n \n• medicines for treating infections (i.e. antibiotics such as erythromycin, rifampicin, etc.; ask \n\nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are unsure whether the medicine you are taking is an \nantibiotic), and including medicines for treating fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole) \n\n• medicines used to help you stabilize your mood also sometimes referred to as anti-depressants \n(e.g. fluoxetine) \n\n• medicines used to treat seizures (epilepsy) (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin) \n• medicines used to help you lower blood lipid levels (e.g. gemfibrozil) \n• medicine used for heartburn or stomach ulcers (e.g. cimetidine) \n• medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, \n\nefavirenz, nevirapine) \n\n\n\n43 \n \n \n\n• a medicine called clopidogrel used to prevent blood clots \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPaclitaxel may cause serious birth defects and should therefore not be used if you are pregnant. Your \ndoctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment with Pazenir. \n \nIf you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use effective contraception during and up to 1 \nmonth after receiving treatment with Pazenir. \n \nDo not breast-feed when taking Pazenir as it is not known if the active ingredient paclitaxel passes into \nthe mother’s milk. \n \nIf you are a male patient, you are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after \ntreatment and you should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the \npossibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Pazenir. \n \nAsk your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people may feel tired or dizzy after being given Pazenir. If this happens to you, do not drive or \nuse any tools or machines. \n \nIf you are given other medicines as part of your treatment, you should ask your doctor for advice on \ndriving and using machines. \n \nPazenir contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3.  How to use Pazenir \n \nPazenir will be given to you by a doctor or nurse into a vein from an intravenous drip. The dose you \nreceive is based on your body surface area and blood test results. The usual dose for breast cancer is \n260 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. The usual dose for advanced \npancreatic cancer is 125 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. The usual dose for \nnon-small cell lung cancer is 100 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. \n \nHow often will you receive Pazenir? \nFor treatment of metastatic breast cancer, Pazenir is usually given once every three weeks (on day 1 of \na 21 day cycle). \n \nFor treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, Pazenir is given on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-\nday treatment cycle with gemcitabine being given immediately after the Pazenir. \n \nFor treatment of non-small cell lung cancer Pazenir is given once every week (i.e. on days 1, 8 and 15 \nof a 21 day cycle), with carboplatin being given once every three weeks (i.e. only on day 1 of each \n21-day cycle), immediately after the Pazenir dose has been given. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n \n\n \nThe very common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people: \n• Loss of hair (the majority of cases of hair loss happened less than one month after starting \n\npaclitaxel.

Gloves, goggles and protective \nclothing should be used. If Pazenir dispersion contacts the skin, the skin should be washed \nimmediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Pazenir contacts mucous membranes, the \nmembranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Pazenir should only be prepared and \nadministered by personnel appropriately trained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff \nshould not handle Pazenir. \n \nGiven the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for \npossible infiltration during administration of the medicinal product. Limiting the infusion of \nPazenir to 30 minutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions. \n \nReconstitution of the product and administration \nPazenir should be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in \nthe administration of cytotoxic agents. \n \nPazenir is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use. After \nreconstitution, each ml of dispersion contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound \nnanoparticles. Reconstituted Pazenir dispersion is administered intravenously using an infusion set \nincorporating a 15 µm filter. \n \nReconstitution of 100 mg: \nUsing a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should \nslowly be injected into the 100 mg vial of Pazenir over a minimum of 1 minute. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n49 \n \n \n\n \nThe solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial. The solution should not be \ninjected directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. \n \nOnce the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to \nensure proper wetting of the solid. Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/or inverted \nfor at least 2 minutes until complete redispersion of any powder occurs. The generation of foam \nshould be avoided. If foaming or clumping occurs, the dispersion should stand for at least 15 minutes \nuntil foam subsides. \n \nThe reconstituted dispersion should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates. Some \nsettling of the reconstituted dispersion may occur. If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial should \nbe gently inverted again to ensure complete redispersion prior to use. \n \nInspect the dispersion in the vial for particulate matter. Do not administer the reconstituted \ndispersion if particulate matter is observed in the vial. \n \nThe exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml dispersion required for the patient should be calculated and \nthe appropriate amount of reconstituted Pazenir should be injected into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-\nPVC type intravenous bag. \nThe use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to \nreconstitute and administer Pazenir may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Administer \nPazenir using an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use \nof a 15 µm filter removes strands and does not change the physical or chemical properties of the \nreconstituted product. \n \nUse of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may result in blockage of the filter. \n \nThe use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to \nprepare or administer Pazenir infusions. \n \nFollowing administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nStability \nUnopened vials of Pazenir are stable until the date indicated on the package when the vial is kept in the \nouter carton in order to protect from light. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the \nstability of the product. This medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage \nconditions. \n \nStability of the reconstituted dispersion in the vial \nAfter first reconstitution, the dispersion should be filled into an infusion bag immediately. However, \nchemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C in the original \ncarton, and protected from bright light. \n \nStability of the reconstituted dispersion in the infusion bag \nAfter reconstitution, the reconstituted dispersion in the infusion bag should be used \nimmediately. However chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 24 \nhours at 2°C-8°C, protected from light followed by 4 hours at 15°C-25°C. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
