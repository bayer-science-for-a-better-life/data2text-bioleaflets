NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLeganto 1 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nLeganto 3 mg/24 h transdermal patch \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nLeganto 1 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nEach patch releases 1 mg of rotigotine per 24 hours. Each patch of 5 cm2 contains 2.25 mg of \nrotigotine.  \n \nLeganto 3 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nEach patch releases 3 mg of rotigotine per 24 hours. Each patch of 15 cm2 contains 6.75 mg of \nrotigotine.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch. \nThin, matrix-type, square-shaped with rounded edges, consisting of three layers.  \n \nLeganto 1 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nThe outside of the backing layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 1 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \nLeganto 3 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nThe outside of the backing layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 3 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLeganto is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs \nSyndrome (RLS) in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. \n \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 1 mg/24 h. Depending on the individual patient response, the \ndose may be increased in weekly increments of 1 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 3 mg/24 h. The need \nfor treatment continuation should be reconsidered every 6 months.  \n \nLeganto is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. \nThe patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of \napplication.  \n \nIf the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, \nanother patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTreatment discontinuation \n \nLeganto should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 1 mg/24 h \nwith a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Leganto (see \nsection 4.4). Following this procedure, rebound (worsening of symptoms beyond initial intensity after \ndiscontinuation of treatment) has not been observed. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution \nis advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine \nclearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be \nneeded in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including \nthose requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute \nworsening of renal function (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of rotigotine in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLeganto is for transdermal use. \n \nThe patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, \nshoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Leganto \nshould not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). \n \nUse and handling \n \nEach patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One \nhalf of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to \nthe skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky \nside of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the \nhand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. \n \nThe patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nMagnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMagnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion \n \nThe backing layer of Leganto contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Leganto should be removed if \nthe patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \n \nDopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in \npostural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with \nrotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. \nIt is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the \ngeneral risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. \n \nSyncope \n \nIn clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed \nin patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were \nexcluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms \nof syncope and pre-syncope. \n \nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence \n \nRotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of \nsleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. \nPrescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not \nacknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination \nof therapy should be carefully considered.  \n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathologic gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome \n \nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations \nincluding paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, \ndisorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. \n \nFibrotic complications \n \nCases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, \npericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived \ndopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, \ncomplete resolution does not always occur. \nAlthough these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these \ncompounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nNeuroleptics \n \nNeuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. \n \nHeat application \n \nExternal heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) \nshould not be applied to the area of the patch. \n \nApplication site reactions \n \nApplication site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is \nrecommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the \nleft side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. \nIf application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an \nincrease in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the \nrisk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. \nIf there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be \navoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. \nIf a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or \npruritus) associated with the use of Leganto is observed, Leganto should be discontinued. \n \nPeripheral oedema \n \nPeripheral oedema has been observed in clinical trials conducted in patients with RLS. \n \nAugmentation \n \nAugmentation may occur. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or \neven the afternoon), increase in severity of symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other body \nparts. In long-term clinical studies with rotigotine, the majority of augmentation episodes were seen in \nthe first and second years of treatment. Doses higher than the approved dose range for RLS should be \navoided as this may lead to higher rates of augmentation (see section 5.1). \n \nSulphite sensitivity \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including \nanaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible \npeople. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBecause rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as \nneuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish \nthe effectiveness of Leganto, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive \neffects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS \n(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol \nin combination with rotigotine. \n \nCo-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nCo-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  \n \nCo-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. \n \nCo-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and \npharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  \nInteractions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential, contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during \ntreatment with rotigotine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice \nat materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should \nnot be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies \nin rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of \nhuman data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. \n \nFertility \n \nFor information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes \nmust be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired \nalertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes \nand somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 748 Leganto- \nand 214 placebo-treated patients, 65.5% of the patients on Leganto and 33.2% of patients on placebo \nreported at least one adverse reaction. \n \nAt the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. \nThese are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Leganto are \nnausea, application site reactions, asthenic conditions and headache. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIn trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in the SmPC \nand package leaflet, 34.2% of 748 patients using Leganto, experienced application site reactions. The \nmajority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to the application \nareas and resulted in discontinuation of Leganto in 7.2% of subjects. \n \nDiscontinuation rate \n \nThe discontinuation rate was studied in 3 clinical trials ranging up to 3 years in duration. The \npercentage of subjects discontinuing was 25-38% over the first year, 10% in the second year, and 11% \nin the third year. Periodic assessment of efficacy should be performed, along with evaluation of safety, \nincluding augmentation. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients \nwith Restless Legs Syndrome and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, \nadverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience \nthe reaction), using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem/organ \nclasses acc. to \n\nMedDRA \n\nVery common \n \n\nCommon \n \n\nUncommon \n \n\nRare Not known \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hypersensitivity, \nwhich may \ninclude \nangioedema, \ntongue oedema \nand lip oedema \n\n   \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n Sleep \nattacks/sudden \nonset of sleep, \nsexual desire \ndisordersa (incl. \nhypersexuality, \nlibido \nincreased), \ninsomnia, sleep \ndisorder, \nabnormal \ndreams, \nimpulse-control \ndisordersa,d (incl. \npathological \ngambling, \nstereotypy/ \npunding, binge \neating/eating \ndisorderb, \ncompulsive \nshoppingc)  \n\nObsessive-\ncompulsive \ndisorder, \nagitationd \n\nAggressive \nbehaviour/ \naggressionb, \ndisorientationd \n\nDopamine \ndysregulation \nsyndromec, \nperception \ndisturbancese \n(incl. \nhallucination, \nhallucination \nvisual, \nhallucination \nauditory, \nillusion), \nnightmaree, \nparanoiae, \nconfusional \nstatee, psychotic \ndisordere, \ndelusione, \ndeliriume \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nHeadache Somnolence   Dizzinesse, \ndisturbances in \nconsciousness \nNECe (incl. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsyncope, \nsyncope \nvasovagal, loss \nof \nconsciousness), \ndyskinesiae, \ndizziness \nposturale, \nlethargye, \nconvulsione \n\nEye disorders     Vision blurrede, \nvisual \nimpairmente, \nphotopsiae \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n    Vertigoe \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n    Palpitationse, \natrial \nfibrillatione, \nsupraventricular \ntachycardiae \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n Hypertension Orthostatic \nhypotension \n\n Hypotensione \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n    Hiccupse \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea Vomiting, \ndyspepsia \n\n  Constipatione, \ndry mouthe, \nabdominal paine, \ndiarrhoeac \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n Pruritus   Erythemae, \nhyperhidrosise, \npruritus \ngeneralisede, skin \nirritatione, \ndermatitis \ncontacte, rash \ngeneralisede \n\nReproductive \nsystem and \nbreast disorder \n\n    Erectile \ndysfunctione \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nApplication and \ninstillation site \nreactionsa (incl. \nerythema, \npruritus, \nirritation, rash, \ndermatitis, \nvesicles, pain, \neczema, \ninflammation, \nswelling, \ndiscolouration, \npapules, \nexfoliation, \n\nIrritability, \noedema \nperipheral \n\n   \n\n\n\n9 \n\nurticaria, \nhypersensitivity), \nasthenic \nconditionsa (incl. \nfatigue, asthenia, \nmalaise) \n\nInvestigations     Weight \ndecreasede, \nhepatic enzyme \nincreasede (incl. \nAST, ALT, \nGGT), weight \nincreasede, heart \nrate increasede, \nCPK increasedd,e  \n\nInjury, \npoisoning and \nprocedural \ncomplications \n\n    Falle \n\nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\n    Rhabdomyolysisc \n\na High Level Term \nb Observed in open-label studies \nc Observed during post-marketing \nd Observed in 2011 data pool of double-blind placebo-controlled studies \ne Observed in studies performed in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence \n \nRotigotine has been associated with somnolence including excessive daytime somnolence and sudden \nsleep onset episodes. In isolated cases \u201csudden onset of sleep\u201d occurred while driving and resulted in \nmotor vehicle accidents (see also sections 4.4 and 4.7). \n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThe most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a \ndopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, \nconfusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\n \nManagement \n \nThere is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal \nof the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input \nis stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be \nmonitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  \nTreatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis \nwould not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. \n \nIf it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 \n \nRotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson\u2019s disease by activation of the D3, D2 \nand D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that \nrotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRegarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, \nrotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-\ndopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, \nbut no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy of rotigotine was evaluated in 5 placebo-controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients \nwith idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Efficacy was demonstrated in controlled trials in \npatients treated for up to 29 weeks. The effect was maintained over a 6 months period.  \n \nThe changes from baseline in the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS) and CGI-item 1 (severity of \nillness) were primary efficacy parameters. For both primary endpoints statistically significant \ndifferences have been observed for the doses 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h in comparison to \nplacebo. After 6 months of maintenance treatment in patients with moderate to severe RLS, the \nbaseline IRLS score improved from 30.7 to 20.7 for placebo and from 30.2 to 13.8 for rotigotine. The \nadjusted mean difference was -6.5 points (CI95% -8.7; -4.4, p <0.0001). CGI-I responder rates (much \nimproved, very much improved) were 43.0% and 67.5% for placebo and rotigotine respectively \n(difference 24.5% CI 95%: 14.2%; 34.8%, p<0.0001). \nIn a placebo-controlled, 7-week trial polysomnographic parameters were investigated. Rotigotine \nsignificantly reduced the periodic limb movement index (PLMI) from 50.9 to 7.7 versus 37.4 to 32.7 \nfor placebo (p<0.0001). \n \nAugmentation \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nIn two 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, clinically relevant augmentation was \nobserved in 1.5% of rotigotine-treated patients versus 0.5% of placebo treated patients. In two open-\nlabel, follow-up studies over a subsequent 12 months, the rate of clinically relevant augmentation was \n2.9%. None of these patients discontinued therapy because of augmentation. In a 5-year open-label \ntreatment study, augmentation occurred in 11.9% of patients treated with the approved dosages for \nRLS (1-3 mg/24 h), and 5.1% were considered clinically significant. In this study, the majority of \naugmentation episodes occurred in the first and second years of treatment. Furthermore, in this study a \nhigher dose of 4 mg/24 h that is unapproved in RLS was also used and led to higher rates of \naugmentation. \n \nSkin adhesion \n \nIn a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 2-way, crossover study in 52 outpatients, the skin \nadhesion of the improved room temperature patch formulation was compared to the cold storage \nformulation, using the 8 mg/24 h rotigotine patch. Skin adhesion was measured on 2 consecutive days \nof 24 hours patch application. The improved room temperature patch formulation showed better skin \nadhesion than the cold storage formulation with >90% of patches showing sufficient adhesion (i.e. \n>70% of the patch area adhering) compared to <83%. Comparable skin tolerability was reported for \nboth formulations. The majority of erythema observed was mild and none severe. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed \nthrough the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application \nand are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. \nRotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to \n24 mg/24 h. \n \nApproximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. \n \nRotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. \nDifferences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder \nversus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. \nThe apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as \ndirect and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to \ncatalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of \nthe parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. \nThe information on metabolites is incomplete. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nElimination \n \nApproximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is \nexcreted in faeces. \nThe clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall \nelimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an \ninitial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. \n \nBecause the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is \nexpected. \n \nSpecial patient groups \n \nBecause therapy with Leganto is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical \ntolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, \nor age is not necessary. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant \nincreases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Leganto was not investigated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment.  \nPlasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal \nfunction. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLimited pharmacokinetic data obtained in adolescent patients with RLS (13-17 years, n=24) following \ntreatment with multiple doses of 0.5 to 3mg/24h showed that systemic exposure to rotigotine was \nsimilar to that observed in adults. Efficacy/safety data is insufficient to establish a relation between \nexposure and response (see also paediatric information in section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine \nagonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  \nAfter a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat \nand monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. \nRetinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the \nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects \nwere more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology \nhave not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological \nevaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these \nfindings to humans is not known. \nIn a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant \ntumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are \nwell-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to \nman. \nThe effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine \nwas not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. \nRotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, \nbecause of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. \n \nRotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse \nLymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This \nmutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed \nin vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it \n\n\n\n13 \n\nran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a \ncytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity \ntest is not known. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLeganto 2 mg/24 h transdermal patch \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach patch releases 2 mg of rotigotine per 24 hours. Each patch of 10 cm2 contains 4.5 mg of \nrotigotine.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch. \nThin, matrix-type, square-shaped with rounded edges, consisting of three layers. The outside of the \nbacking layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 2 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRestless Legs Syndrome \n \nLeganto is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs \nSyndrome (RLS) in adults. \n \nParkinson\u2019s disease \n \nLeganto is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course \nof the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent \nand fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or \u2018on-off\u2019 fluctuations). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. \n \nRestless Legs Syndrome \n \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 1 mg/24 h. Depending on the individual patient response, the \ndose may be increased in weekly increments of 1 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 3 mg/24 h. The need \nfor treatment continuation should be reconsidered every 6 months.  \n \nParkinson\u2019s disease \n \nDosing in patients with early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease: \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 2 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h. \n4 mg/24 h may be an effective dose in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is reached \nwithin 3 or 4 weeks at doses of 6 mg/24 h or 8 mg/24 h, respectively. \nThe maximum dose is 8 mg/24 h. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nDosing in patients with advanced stage Parkinson\u2019s disease with fluctuations: \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 4 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. \n4 mg/24 h or 6 mg/24 h may be effective doses in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is \nreached within 3 to 7 weeks at doses of 8 mg/24 h up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. \n \nFor doses higher than 8 mg/24 h multiple patches may be used to achieve the final dose e.g. \n10 mg/24 h may be reached by combination of a 6 mg/24 h and a 4 mg/24 h patch.  \n \nLeganto is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. \nThe patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of \napplication.  \n \nIf the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, \nanother patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nRestless Legs Syndrome \n \nLeganto should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 1 mg/24 h \nwith a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Leganto (see \nsection 4.4). Following this procedure, rebound (worsening of symptoms beyond initial intensity after \ndiscontinuation of treatment) has not been observed. \n \nParkinson\u2019s disease \n \nLeganto should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 2 mg/24 h \nwith a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Leganto (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution \nis advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine \nclearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be \nneeded in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including \nthose requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute \nworsening of renal function (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of rotigotine in children and adolescents have not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology in children \nwith RLS can be made. \nThere is no relevant use of Leganto in the paediatric population in Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLeganto is for transdermal use. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nThe patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, \nshoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Leganto \nshould not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). \n \nUse and handling \n \nEach patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One \nhalf of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to \nthe skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky \nside of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the \nhand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. \n \nThe patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nMagnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIf a Parkinson\u2019s disease patient is insufficiently controlled while on treatment with rotigotine \nswitching to another dopamine agonist might provide additional benefit (see section 5.1) \n \nBoth indications: \n \nMagnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion \n \nThe backing layer of Leganto contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Leganto should be removed if \nthe patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \n \nDopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in \npostural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with \nrotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. \nIt is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the \ngeneral risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. \n \nSyncope \n \nIn clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed \nin patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were \nexcluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms \nof syncope and pre-syncope. \n \nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence \n \nRotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of \nsleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. \nPrescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not \nacknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination \nof therapy should be carefully considered.  \n \nImpulse control disorders \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathologic gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome \n \nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations \nincluding paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, \ndisorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. \n \nFibrotic complications \n \nCases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, \npericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived \ndopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, \ncomplete resolution does not always occur. \nAlthough these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these \ncompounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. \n \nNeuroleptics \n \nNeuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. \n \nHeat application \n \nExternal heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) \nshould not be applied to the area of the patch. \n \nApplication site reactions \n \nApplication site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is \nrecommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the \nleft side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. \nIf application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an \nincrease in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the \nrisk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. \nIf there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be \navoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. \nIf a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or \npruritus) associated with the use of Leganto is observed, Leganto should be discontinued. \n \nPeripheral oedema \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn clinical studies in Parkinson\u2019s patients, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at \nabout 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months. Peripheral oedema has also been \nobserved in clinical trials conducted in patients with RLS. \n \nSulphite sensitivity \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including \nanaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible \npeople. \n \nObserved in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n \nDopaminergic adverse reactions \n \nThe incidence of some dopaminergic adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, dyskinesia, and \nperipheral oedema generally is higher when given in combination with L-dopa in Parkinson\u2019s patients. \nThis should be considered when prescribing rotigotine. \n \nObserved in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome \n \nAugmentation \n \nAugmentation may occur in Restless Legs Syndrome patients. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset \nof symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in severity of symptoms, and spread of \nsymptoms to involve other body parts. In long-term clinical studies with rotigotine, the majority of \naugmentation episodes were seen in the first and second years of treatment. Doses higher than the \napproved dose range for RLS should be avoided as this may lead to higher rates of augmentation (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBecause rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as \nneuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish \nthe effectiveness of Leganto, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive \neffects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS \n(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol \nin combination with rotigotine. \n \nCo-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. \n \nCo-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  \n \nCo-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. \n \nLeganto may potentiate the dopaminergic adverse reaction of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate \npre-existing dyskinesia, as described with other dopamine agonists. \n \nCo-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and \npharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  \nInteractions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential, contraception in females \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during \ntreatment with rotigotine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice \nat materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should \nnot be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies \nin rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of \nhuman data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. \n \nFertility \n \nFor information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes \nmust be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired \nalertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes \nand somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nRestless Legs Syndrome \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 748 Leganto- \nand 214 placebo-treated patients, 65.5% of the patients on Leganto and 33.2% of patients on placebo \nreported at least one adverse reaction. \n \nAt the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. \nThese are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Leganto are \nnausea, application site reactions, asthenic conditions and headache. \n \nIn trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in the SmPC \nand package leaflet, 34.2% of 748 patients using Leganto, experienced application site reactions. The \nmajority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to the application \nareas and resulted in discontinuation of Leganto in 7.2% of subjects. \n \nDiscontinuation rate \n \nThe discontinuation rate was studied in 3 clinical trials ranging up to 3 years in duration. The \npercentage of subjects discontinuing was 25-38% over the first year, 10% in the second year, and 11% \nin the third year. Periodic assessment of efficacy should be performed, along with evaluation of safety, \nincluding augmentation. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nThe following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients \nwith Restless Legs Syndrome and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, \nadverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience \nthe reaction), using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThe most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a \ndopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, \nconfusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal \nof the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27 \n\nis stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be \nmonitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  \nTreatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis \nwould not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. \n \nIf it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 \n \nRotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson\u2019s disease by activation of the D3, D2 \nand D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that \nrotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRegarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, \nrotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-\ndopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, \nbut no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical studies in Restless Legs Syndrome \n \nThe efficacy of rotigotine was evaluated in 5 placebo-controlled trials with more than 1,400 patients \nwith idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Efficacy was demonstrated in controlled trials in \npatients treated for up to 29 weeks. The effect was maintained over a 6 months period.  \n \nThe changes from baseline in the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS) and CGI-item 1 (severity of \nillness) were primary efficacy parameters. For both primary endpoints statistically significant \ndifferences have been observed for the doses 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h in comparison to \nplacebo. After 6 months of maintenance treatment in patients with moderate to severe RLS, the \nbaseline IRLS score improved from 30.7 to 20.7 for placebo and from 30.2 to 13.8 for rotigotine. The \nadjusted mean difference was -6.5 points (CI95% -8.7; -4.4, p <0.0001). CGI-I responder rates (much \nimproved, very much improved) were 43.0% and 67.5% for placebo and rotigotine respectively \n(difference 24.5% CI 95%: 14.2%; 34.8%, p<0.0001). \nIn a placebo-controlled, 7-week trial polysomnographic parameters were investigated. Rotigotine \nsignificantly reduced the periodic limb movement index (PLMI) from 50.9 to 7.7 versus 37.4 to 32.7 \nfor placebo (p<0.0001). \n \nAugmentation \n \nIn two 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, clinically relevant augmentation was \nobserved in 1.5% of rotigotine-treated patients versus 0.5% of placebo treated patients. In two open-\n\n\n\n28 \n\nlabel, follow-up studies over a subsequent 12 months, the rate of clinically relevant augmentation was \n2.9%. None of these patients discontinued therapy because of augmentation. In a 5-year open-label \ntreatment study, augmentation occurred in 11.9% of patients treated with the approved dosages for \nRLS (1-3 mg/24 h), and 5.1% were considered clinically significant. In this study, the majority of \naugmentation episodes occurred in the first and second years of treatment. Furthermore, in this study a \nhigher dose of 4 mg/24 h that is unapproved in RLS was also used and led to higher rates of \naugmentation. \n \nClinical studies in Parkinson\u2019s disease \n \nThe effectiveness of rotigotine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's \ndisease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of four pivotal, \nparallel, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies and three studies investigating specific \naspects of Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nTwo pivotal trials (SP512 Part I and SP513 Part I) investigating the effectiveness of rotigotine in \nthe treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease were conducted in patients \nwho were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa na\u00efve or \nprevious L-dopa treatment was \u2264 6 months. The primary outcome assessment was the score for the \nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) component (Part II) plus the Motor Examination component (Part \nIII) of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).  \nEfficacy was determined by the subject\u2019s response to therapy in terms of responder and absolute \npoints improvement in the scores of ADL and Motor Examination combined (UPDRS part II+III). \n \nIn the double blind study SP512 Part I, 177 patients received rotigotine and 96 patients received \nplacebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly increments \nof 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 6 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group \nwere maintained at their optimal dose for 6 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment in 91% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose \nwas the maximal dose allowed i.e. 6 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 48% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine and in 19% of the subjects receiving placebo (Difference 29%, CI95% \n18%; 39%, p<0.0001). With rotigotine, the mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was \n-3.98 points (baseline 29.9 points) whereas in the placebo-treated arm a worsening of 1.31 points was \nobserved (baseline 30.0 points). The difference was 5.28 points and statistically significant \n(p<0.0001).  \n \nIn the double-blind study SP513 Part I, 213 patients received rotigotine, 227 received ropinirole and \n117 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h over 4 weeks. In the \nropinirole group, patients were titrated to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 24 mg/day over 13 \nweeks. Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 6 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment in 92% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose \nwas the maximal dose allowed i.e. 8 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 52% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine, 68% of the subjects receiving ropinirole and 30% of the subjects \nreceiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 21.7%, CI95% 11.1%; 32.4%, difference \nropinirole versus placebo 38.4%, CI95% 28.1%; 48.6%, difference ropinirole versus rotigotine 16.6%, \nCI95% 7.6%; 25.7%). The mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 6.83 points \n(baseline 33.2 points) in the rotigotine arm, 10.78 points in the ropinirole arm (baseline 32.2 points) \nand 2.33 points in the placebo arm (baseline 31.3 points). All differences between the active \ntreatments and placebo were statistically significant. This study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority \nof rotigotine to ropinirole.  \n \nIn a subsequent open-label study (SP824), a multicenter, multinational study, the tolerability of \novernight switching from ropinirole, pramipexole or cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal patch and \nits effect on symptoms in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease have been studied. 116 patients \nwere switched from previous oral therapy to receive up to 8 mg/24 h of rotigotine, among these were \n47 who had been treated with ropinirole up to 9 mg/day, 47 who had been treated with pramipexole up \n\n\n\n29 \n\nto 2 mg/day and 22 who had been treated with cabergoline up to 3 mg/day. Switching to rotigotine \nwas feasible, with minor dose adjustment (median 2 mg/24 h) being necessary in only 2 patients \nswitching from ropinirole, 5 patients from pramipexole and 4 patients from cabergoline. \nImprovements were seen in UPDRS Parts I - IV scores. The safety profile was unchanged from that \nobserved in previous studies. \n \nIn a randomized, open-label study (SP825) in patients with early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, 25 \npatients were randomized to rotigotine treatment and 26 to ropinirole. In both arms treatment was \ntitrated to optimal or maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h or 9 mg/day, respectively. Both treatments showed \nimprovements in early morning motor function and sleep. Motor symptoms (UPDRS Part III) \nimproved by 6.3 \u00b1 1.3 points in rotigotine-treated patients, and by 5.9 \u00b1 1.3 points in the ropinirole-\ngroup after 4 weeks of maintenance. Sleep (PDSS) improved by 4.1 \u00b1 13.8 points for rotigotine-\ntreated patients, and by 2.5 \u00b1 13.5 points for ropinirole-treated patients. The safety profile was \ncomparable, with the exception of application site reactions. \n \nIn studies SP824 and SP825 conducted since the initial comparative trial, rotigotine and ropinirole at \nequivalent doses were shown to have comparable efficacy. \n \nTwo additional pivotal trials (SP650DB and SP515) were conducted in patients who were receiving \nconcomitant levodopa therapy. The primary outcome assessment was the reduction in \u201coff\u201d time \n(hours). Efficacy was determined by the subject\u2019s response to therapy in terms of responder and \nabsolute improvement in the time spent \u201coff\u201d. \n \nIn the double blind study SP650DB, 113 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of \n8 mg/24 h, 109 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/24 h and 119 patients \nreceived placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal doses of rotigotine or placebo in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group were maintained at \ntheir optimal dose for 6 months. At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least \n30% was seen in 57% and 55% of the subjects receiving rotigotine 8 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, \nrespectively and in 34% of the subjects receiving placebo (Differences 22% and 21%, respectively, \nCI95% 10%; 35% and 8%; 33%, respectively, p<0.001 for both rotigotine groups). With rotigotine, the \nmean reductions in \u201coff\u201d time were 2.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively whereas in the placebo-treated arm \na reduction of 0.9 hours was observed. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001 and \np=0.003, respectively). \n \nIn the double-blind study SP515, 201 patients received rotigotine, 200 received pramipexole and \n100 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. In the pramipexole \ngroup, patients received 0,375 mg in the first week, 0.75 mg in the second week and were titrated \nfurther in weekly increments of 0.75 mg to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day. \nPatients in each treatment group were maintained for 4 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 30% was seen in 60% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine, 67% of the subjects receiving pramipexole and 35% of the subjects \nreceiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 25%, CI95% 13%; 36%, difference pramipexole \nversus placebo 32%, CI95% 21%; 43%, difference pramipexole versus rotigotine 7%, CI95% -2%; 17%). \nThe mean reduction in the \u201coff\u201d time was 2.5 hours in the rotigotine arm, 2.8 hours in the pramipexole \narm and 0.9 hours in the placebo arm. All differences between the active treatments and placebo were \nstatistically significant.  \n \nA further multinational double-blind study (SP889) was conducted in 287 patients with early or \nadvanced stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease who had unsatisfactory early morning motor symptom control. \n81.5% of these patients were on concomitant levodopa therapy. 190 patients received rotigotine, and \n97 placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h over 8 weeks, \nfollowed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Early morning motor function, assessed by UPDRS part \nIII, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the modified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Sleep Scale \n\n\n\n30 \n\n(PDSS-2), were co-primary outcome measures. At the end of maintenance, the mean UPDRS part III \nscore had improved by 7.0 points in rotigotine-treated patients (baseline 29.6), and by 3.9 points in the \nplacebo-group (baseline 32.0). Improvements in the mean PDSS-2 total score were 5.9 (rotigotine, \nbaseline 19.3) and 1.9 points (placebo, baseline 20.5). Treatment differences for the coprimary \nvariables were statistically significant (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001). \n \nSkin adhesion \n \nIn a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 2-way, crossover study in 52 outpatients, the skin \nadhesion of the improved room temperature patch formulation was compared to the cold storage \nformulation, using the 8 mg/24 h rotigotine patch. Skin adhesion was measured on 2 consecutive days \nof 24 hours patch application. The improved room temperature patch formulation showed better skin \nadhesion than the cold storage formulation with >90% of patches showing sufficient adhesion (i.e. \n>70% of the patch area adhering) compared to <83%. Comparable skin tolerability was reported for \nboth formulations. The majority of erythema observed was mild and none severe. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed \nthrough the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application \nand are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. \nRotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to \n24 mg/24 h. \n \nApproximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. \n \nRotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. \nDifferences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder \nversus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. \nThe apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as \ndirect and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to \ncatalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of \nthe parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. \nThe information on metabolites is incomplete. \n \nElimination \n \nApproximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is \nexcreted in faeces. \nThe clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall \nelimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an \ninitial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. \n \nBecause the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is \nexpected. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nSpecial patient groups \n \nBecause therapy with Leganto is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical \ntolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, \nor age is not necessary. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant \nincreases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Leganto was not investigated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment.  \nPlasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal \nfunction. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nLimited pharmacokinetic data obtained in adolescent patients with RLS (13-17 years, n=24) following \ntreatment with multiple doses of 0.5 to 3mg/24h showed that systemic exposure to rotigotine was \nsimilar to that observed in adults. Efficacy/safety data is insufficient to establish a relation between \nexposure and response (see also paediatric information in section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine \nagonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  \nAfter a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat \nand monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. \nRetinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the \nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects \nwere more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology \nhave not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological \nevaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these \nfindings to humans is not known. \nIn a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant \ntumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are \nwell-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to \nman. \nThe effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine \nwas not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. \nRotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, \nbecause of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. \n \nRotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse \nLymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This \nmutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed \nin vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it \nran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a \ncytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity \ntest is not known. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch. \nThin, matrix-type, square-shaped with rounded edges, consisting of three layers.  \n \nLeganto 4 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nThe outside of the backing layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 4 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \nLeganto 6 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nThe outside of the backing layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 6 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \nLeganto 8 mg/24 h transdermal patch \nThe outside of the backing layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 8 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLeganto is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course \nof the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent \nand fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or \u2018on-off\u2019 fluctuations). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nDosing in patients with early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease: \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 2 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h. \n4 mg/24 h may be an effective dose in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is reached \nwithin 3 or 4 weeks at doses of 6 mg/24 h or 8 mg/24 h, respectively. \nThe maximum dose is 8 mg/24 h. \n \nDosing in patients with advanced stage Parkinson\u2019s disease with fluctuations: \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 4 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. \n4 mg/24 h or 6 mg/24 h may be effective doses in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is \nreached within 3 to 7 weeks at doses of 8 mg/24 h up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. \n \nFor doses higher than 8 mg/24 h multiple patches may be used to achieve the final dose e.g. \n10 mg/24 h may be reached by combination of a 6 mg/24 h and a 4 mg/24 h patch.  \n \nLeganto is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. \nThe patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of \napplication.  \n \nIf the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, \nanother patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nLeganto should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 2 mg/24 h \nwith a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Leganto (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution \nis advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine \nclearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be \nneeded in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including \nthose requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute \nworsening of renal function (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Leganto in the paediatric population in Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLeganto is for transdermal use. \n \nThe patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, \nshoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Leganto \nshould not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nUse and handling \n \nEach patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One \nhalf of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to \nthe skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky \nside of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the \nhand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. \n \nThe patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nMagnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIf a Parkinson\u2019s disease patient is insufficiently controlled while on treatment with rotigotine \nswitching to another dopamine agonist might provide additional benefit (see section 5.1) \n \nMagnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion \n \nThe backing layer of Leganto contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Leganto should be removed if \nthe patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \n \nDopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in \npostural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with \nrotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. \nIt is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the \ngeneral risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. \n \nSyncope \n \nIn clinical studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that observed \nin patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease were \nexcluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked about symptoms \nof syncope and pre-syncope. \n \nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence \n \nRotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of \nsleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. \nPrescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not \nacknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination \nof therapy should be carefully considered.  \n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathologic gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations \nincluding paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, \ndisorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. \n \nFibrotic complications \n \nCases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, \npericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived \ndopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, \ncomplete resolution does not always occur. \nAlthough these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these \ncompounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. \n \nNeuroleptics \n \nNeuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. \n \nHeat application \n \nExternal heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) \nshould not be applied to the area of the patch. \n \nApplication site reactions \n \nApplication site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is \nrecommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the \nleft side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. \nIf application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an \nincrease in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the \nrisk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. \nIf there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be \navoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. \nIf a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or \npruritus) associated with the use of Leganto is observed, Leganto should be discontinued. \n \nPeripheral oedema \n \nIn clinical studies in Parkinson\u2019s patients, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at \nabout 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months. \n \nDopaminergic adverse reactions \n \nThe incidence of some dopaminergic adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, dyskinesia, and \nperipheral oedema generally is higher when given in combination with L-dopa in Parkinson\u2019s patients. \nThis should be considered when prescribing rotigotine. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nSulphite sensitivity \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including \nanaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible \npeople. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBecause rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as \nneuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish \nthe effectiveness of Leganto, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive \neffects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS \n(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol \nin combination with rotigotine. \n \nCo-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. \n \nCo-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  \n \nCo-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. \n \nLeganto may potentiate the dopaminergic adverse reaction of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate \npre-existing dyskinesia, as described with other dopamine agonists. \n \nCo-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and \npharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  \nInteractions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential, contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during \ntreatment with rotigotine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice \nat materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should \nnot be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies \nin rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of \nhuman data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. \n \nFertility \n \nFor information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes \nmust be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired \nalertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes \nand somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 1,307 Leganto- \nand 607 placebo-treated patients, 72.5% of the patients on Leganto and 58.0% of patients on placebo \nreported at least one adverse reaction. \n \nAt the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. \nThese are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Leganto \ntransdermal patch are nausea, vomiting, application site reactions, somnolence, dizziness and \nheadache. \n \nIn trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in SmPC and \npackage leaflet, 35.7% of 830 patients using the Leganto transdermal patch, experienced application \nsite reactions. The majority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to \nthe application areas and resulted in discontinuation of treatment with Leganto in only 4.3% of all \nsubjects receiving Leganto. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients \nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease and from post-marketing experience. Within the system organ classes, \nadverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency (number of patients expected to experience \nthe reaction), using the following categories: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data).

In isolated cases \u201csudden onset of sleep\u201d occurred while driving and resulted in \nmotor vehicle accidents (see also sections 4.4 and 4.7). \n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThe most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a \ndopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, \nconfusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal \nof the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input \nis stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be \nmonitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  \nTreatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis \nwould not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. \n \nIf it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 \n \nRotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson\u2019s disease by activation of the D3, D2 \nand D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that \nrotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRegarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, \nrotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-\ndopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, \nbut no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe effectiveness of rotigotine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's \ndisease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of four pivotal, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n43 \n\nparallel, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies and three studies investigating specific \naspects of Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nTwo pivotal trials (SP512 Part I and SP513 Part I) investigating the effectiveness of rotigotine in \nthe treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease were conducted in patients \nwho were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa na\u00efve or \nprevious L-dopa treatment was \u2264 6 months. The primary outcome assessment was the score for the \nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) component (Part II) plus the Motor Examination component (Part \nIII) of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).  \nEfficacy was determined by the subject\u2019s response to therapy in terms of responder and absolute \npoints improvement in the scores of ADL and Motor Examination combined (UPDRS part II+III). \n \nIn the double blind study SP512 Part I, 177 patients received rotigotine and 96 patients received \nplacebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly increments \nof 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 6 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group \nwere maintained at their optimal dose for 6 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment in 91% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose \nwas the maximal dose allowed i.e. 6 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 48% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine and in 19% of the subjects receiving placebo (Difference 29%, CI95% \n18%; 39%, p<0.0001). With rotigotine, the mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was \n-3.98 points (baseline 29.9 points) whereas in the placebo-treated arm a worsening of 1.31 points was \nobserved (baseline 30.0 points). The difference was 5.28 points and statistically significant \n(p<0.0001).  \n \nIn the double-blind study SP513 Part I, 213 patients received rotigotine, 227 received ropinirole and \n117 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h over 4 weeks. In the \nropinirole group, patients were titrated to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 24 mg/day over 13 \nweeks. Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 6 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment in 92% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose \nwas the maximal dose allowed i.e. 8 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 52% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine, 68% of the subjects receiving ropinirole and 30% of the subjects \nreceiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 21.7%, CI95% 11.1%; 32.4%, difference \nropinirole versus placebo 38.4%, CI95% 28.1%; 48.6%, difference ropinirole versus rotigotine 16.6%, \nCI95% 7.6%; 25.7%). The mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 6.83 points \n(baseline 33.2 points) in the rotigotine arm, 10.78 points in the ropinirole arm (baseline 32.2 points) \nand 2.33 points in the placebo arm (baseline 31.3 points). All differences between the active \ntreatments and placebo were statistically significant. This study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority \nof rotigotine to ropinirole.  \n \nIn a subsequent open-label study (SP824), a multicenter, multinational study, the tolerability of \novernight switching from ropinirole, pramipexole or cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal patch and \nits effect on symptoms in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease have been studied. 116 patients \nwere switched from previous oral therapy to receive up to 8 mg/24 h of rotigotine, among these were \n47 who had been treated with ropinirole up to 9 mg/day, 47 who had been treated with pramipexole up \nto 2 mg/day and 22 who had been treated with cabergoline up to 3 mg/day. Switching to rotigotine \nwas feasible, with minor dose adjustment (median 2 mg/24 h) being necessary in only 2 patients \nswitching from ropinirole, 5 patients from pramipexole and 4 patients from cabergoline. \nImprovements were seen in UPDRS Parts I - IV scores. The safety profile was unchanged from that \nobserved in previous studies. \n \nIn a randomized, open-label study (SP825) in patients with early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, 25 \npatients were randomized to rotigotine treatment and 26 to ropinirole. In both arms treatment was \ntitrated to optimal or maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h or 9 mg/day, respectively. Both treatments showed \nimprovements in early morning motor function and sleep. Motor symptoms (UPDRS Part III) \nimproved by 6.3 \u00b1 1.3 points in rotigotine-treated patients, and by 5.9 \u00b1 1.3 points in the ropinirole-\ngroup after 4 weeks of maintenance. Sleep (PDSS) improved by 4.1 \u00b1 13.8 points for rotigotine-\n\n\n\n44 \n\ntreated patients, and by 2.5 \u00b1 13.5 points for ropinirole-treated patients. The safety profile was \ncomparable, with the exception of application site reactions. \n \nIn studies SP824 and SP825 conducted since the initial comparative trial, rotigotine and ropinirole at \nequivalent doses were shown to have comparable efficacy. \n \nTwo additional pivotal trials (SP650DB and SP515) were conducted in patients who were receiving \nconcomitant levodopa therapy. The primary outcome assessment was the reduction in \u201coff\u201d time \n(hours). Efficacy was determined by the subject\u2019s response to therapy in terms of responder and \nabsolute improvement in the time spent \u201coff\u201d. \n \nIn the double blind study SP650DB, 113 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of \n8 mg/24 h, 109 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/24 h and 119 patients \nreceived placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal doses of rotigotine or placebo in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group were maintained at \ntheir optimal dose for 6 months. At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least \n30% was seen in 57% and 55% of the subjects receiving rotigotine 8 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, \nrespectively and in 34% of the subjects receiving placebo (Differences 22% and 21%, respectively, \nCI95% 10%; 35% and 8%; 33%, respectively, p<0.001 for both rotigotine groups). With rotigotine, the \nmean reductions in \u201coff\u201d time were 2.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively whereas in the placebo-treated arm \na reduction of 0.9 hours was observed. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001 and \np=0.003, respectively). \n \nIn the double-blind study SP515, 201 patients received rotigotine, 200 received pramipexole and \n100 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. In the pramipexole \ngroup, patients received 0,375 mg in the first week, 0.75 mg in the second week and were titrated \nfurther in weekly increments of 0.75 mg to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day. \nPatients in each treatment group were maintained for 4 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 30% was seen in 60% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine, 67% of the subjects receiving pramipexole and 35% of the subjects \nreceiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 25%, CI95% 13%; 36%, difference pramipexole \nversus placebo 32%, CI95% 21%; 43%, difference pramipexole versus rotigotine 7%, CI95% -2%; 17%). \nThe mean reduction in the \u201coff\u201d time was 2.5 hours in the rotigotine arm, 2.8 hours in the pramipexole \narm and 0.9 hours in the placebo arm. All differences between the active treatments and placebo were \nstatistically significant.  \n \nA further multinational double-blind study (SP889) was conducted in 287 patients with early or \nadvanced stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease who had unsatisfactory early morning motor symptom control. \n81.5% of these patients were on concomitant levodopa therapy. 190 patients received rotigotine, and \n97 placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h over 8 weeks, \nfollowed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Early morning motor function, assessed by UPDRS part \nIII, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the modified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Sleep Scale \n(PDSS-2), were co-primary outcome measures. At the end of maintenance, the mean UPDRS part III \nscore had improved by 7.0 points in rotigotine-treated patients (baseline 29.6), and by 3.9 points in the \nplacebo-group (baseline 32.0). Improvements in the mean PDSS-2 total score were 5.9 (rotigotine, \nbaseline 19.3) and 1.9 points (placebo, baseline 20.5). Treatment differences for the coprimary \nvariables were statistically significant (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001). \n \nSkin adhesion \n \nIn a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 2-way, crossover study in 52 outpatients, the skin \nadhesion of the improved room temperature patch formulation was compared to the cold storage \nformulation, using the 8 mg/24 h rotigotine patch. Skin adhesion was measured on 2 consecutive days \nof 24 hours patch application. The improved room temperature patch formulation showed better skin \nadhesion than the cold storage formulation with >90% of patches showing sufficient adhesion (i.e. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n>70% of the patch area adhering) compared to <83%. Comparable skin tolerability was reported for \nboth formulations. The majority of erythema observed was mild and none severe. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed \nthrough the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application \nand are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. \nRotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to \n24 mg/24 h. \n \nApproximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. \n \nRotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. \nDifferences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder \nversus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. \nThe apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as \ndirect and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to \ncatalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of \nthe parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. \nThe information on metabolites is incomplete. \n \nElimination \n \nApproximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is \nexcreted in faeces. \nThe clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall \nelimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an \ninitial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. \n \nBecause the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is \nexpected. \n \nSpecial patient groups \n \nBecause therapy with Leganto is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical \ntolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, \nor age is not necessary. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant \nincreases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Leganto was not investigated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment.  \nPlasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal \nfunction. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine \nagonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  \nAfter a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat \nand monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. \nRetinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the \nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects \nwere more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology \nhave not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological \nevaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these \nfindings to humans is not known. \nIn a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant \ntumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are \nwell-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to \nman. \nThe effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine \nwas not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. \nRotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, \nbecause of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. \n \nRotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse \nLymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This \nmutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed \nin vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it \nran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a \ncytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity \ntest is not known. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTransdermal patch. \nThin, matrix-type, square-shaped with rounded edges, consisting of three layers. The outside of the \nbacking layer is tan-coloured and imprinted with \u2018Leganto 2 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h or \n8 mg/24 h\u2019. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLeganto is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course \nof the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent \nand fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or \u2018on-off\u2019 fluctuations). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose recommendations made are in nominal dose. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nDosing in patients with early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease: \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 2 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h. \n4 mg/24 h may be an effective dose in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is reached \nwithin 3 or 4 weeks at doses of 6 mg/24 h or 8 mg/24 h, respectively. \nThe maximum dose is 8 mg/24 h. \n \nDosing in patients with advanced stage Parkinson\u2019s disease with fluctuations: \nA single daily dose should be initiated at 4 mg/24 h and then increased in weekly increments of \n2 mg/24 h to an effective dose up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. \n4 mg/24 h or 6 mg/24 h may be effective doses in some patients. For most patients an effective dose is \nreached within 3 to 7 weeks at doses of 8 mg/24 h up to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. \n \nLeganto treatment initiation pack contains 4 different packages (one for each strength) with 7 patches \neach, for the first four weeks of therapy.  \nDepending on the patient\u2019s response, not all of the following dose steps may be required or additional \nhigher doses may be needed after week 4, which are not covered by this package. \nOn the first day of treatment the patient starts with Leganto 2 mg/24 h. During the second week, the \npatient takes Leganto 4 mg/24 h. During the third week, he or she takes Leganto 6 mg/24 h and during \nthe fourth week Leganto 8 mg/24 h. The packages are marked with \u201cWeek 1 (2, 3 or 4)\u201d. \n \nLeganto is applied once a day. The patch should be applied at approximately the same time every day. \nThe patch remains on the skin for 24 hours and will then be replaced by a new one at a different site of \napplication.  \n \nIf the patient forgets to apply the patch at the usual time of the day or if the patch becomes detached, \nanother patch should be applied for the remainder of the day. \n \nTreatment discontinuation \n \nLeganto should be discontinued gradually. The daily dose should be reduced in steps of 2 mg/24 h \nwith a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal of Leganto (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Caution \nis advised when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, which may result in lower rotigotine \nclearance. Rotigotine has not been investigated in this patient group. A dose reduction might be \nneeded in case of worsening of the hepatic impairment.  \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAdjustment of the dose is not necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, including \nthose requiring dialysis. Unexpected accumulation of rotigotine levels may also occur at acute \nworsening of renal function (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Leganto in the paediatric population in Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nLeganto is for transdermal use. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nThe patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact healthy skin on the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, \nshoulder, or upper arm. Reapplication to the same site within 14 days should be avoided. Leganto \nshould not be placed on skin that is red, irritated or damaged (see section 4.4). \n \nUse and handling \n \nEach patch is packed in a sachet and should be applied directly after the sachet has been opened. One \nhalf of the release liner should be removed and the sticky side should be applied and pressed firmly to \nthe skin. Then, the patch is fold back and the second part of the release liner is removed. The sticky \nside of the patch should not be touched. The patch should be pressed down firmly with the palm of the \nhand for about 30 seconds, so that it sticks well. \n \nThe patch should not be cut into pieces. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nMagnetic resonance imaging or cardioversion (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIf a Parkinson\u2019s disease patient is insufficiently controlled while on treatment with rotigotine \nswitching to another dopamine agonist might provide additional benefit (see section 5.1) \n \nMagnetic resonance imaging and cardioversion \n \nThe backing layer of Leganto contains aluminium. To avoid skin burns, Leganto should be removed if \nthe patient has to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion. \n \nOrthostatic hypotension \n \nDopamine agonists are known to impair the systemic regulation of the blood pressure resulting in \npostural/orthostatic hypotension. These events have also been observed during treatment with \nrotigotine, but the incidence was similar to that observed in placebo-treated patients. \nIt is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the \ngeneral risk of orthostatic hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy. \n \nSyncope \n \nIn clinical trial studies with rotigotine, syncope has been observed at a rate that was similar to that \nobserved in patients treated with placebo. Because patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular \ndisease were excluded in these studies, patients with severe cardiovascular disease should be asked \nabout symptoms of syncope and pre-syncope. \n \nSudden onset of sleep and somnolence \n \nRotigotine has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of \nsleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness of any warning signs, has been reported. \nPrescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, as patients may not \nacknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned. A reduction of dosage or termination \nof therapy should be carefully considered.  \n \nImpulse control disorders \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and \ncarers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including \npathologic gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating \n\n\n\n52 \n\nand compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists, including rotigotine. Dose \nreduction/tapered discontinuation should be considered if such symptoms develop. \n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome \n \nSymptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal \nof dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended to taper treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour \n \nAbnormal thinking and behaviour have been reported and can consist of a variety of manifestations \nincluding paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behaviour, \ndisorientation, aggressive behaviour, agitation, and delirium. \n \nFibrotic complications \n \nCases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, \npericarditis and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived \ndopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when treatment is discontinued, \ncomplete resolution does not always occur. \nAlthough these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these \ncompounds, whether other, nonergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. \n \nNeuroleptics \n \nNeuroleptics given as antiemetic should not be given to patients taking dopamine agonists (see also \nsection 4.5). \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring \n \nOphthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur. \n \nHeat application \n \nExternal heat (excessive sunlight, heating pads and other sources of heat such as sauna, hot bath) \nshould not be applied to the area of the patch. \n \nApplication site reactions \n \nApplication site skin reactions may occur and are usually mild or moderate in intensity. It is \nrecommended that the application site should be rotated on a daily basis (e.g. from the right side to the \nleft side and from the upper body to the lower body). The same site should not be used within 14 days. \nIf application site reactions occur which last for more than a few days or are persistent, if there is an \nincrease in severity, or if the skin reaction spreads outside the application site, an assessment of the \nrisk/benefit balance for the individual patient should be conducted. \nIf there is a skin rash or irritation from the transdermal system, direct sunlight on the area should be \navoided until the skin heals, as exposure could lead to changes in the skin color. \nIf a generalised skin reaction (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or \npruritus) associated with the use of Leganto is observed, Leganto should be discontinued. \n \nPeripheral oedema \n \nIn clinical studies in Parkinson\u2019s patients, the 6 month-specific rates of peripheral oedema remained at \nabout 4% through the entire observation period up to 36 months. \n \nDopaminergic adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\nThe incidence of some dopaminergic adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, dyskinesia, and \nperipheral oedema generally is higher when given in combination with L-dopa in Parkinson\u2019s patients. \nThis should be considered when prescribing rotigotine. \n \nSulphite sensitivity \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite, a sulphite that may cause allergic-type reactions including \nanaphylactic symptoms and life threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible \npeople. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBecause rotigotine is a dopamine agonist, it is assumed that dopamine antagonists, such as \nneuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish \nthe effectiveness of Leganto, and co-administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive \neffects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS \n(central nervous system) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) or alcohol \nin combination with rotigotine. \n \nCo-administration of L-dopa and carbidopa with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and carbidopa. \n \nCo-administration of domperidone with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine.  \n \nCo-administration of omeprazole (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the \npharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers. \n \nLeganto may potentiate the dopaminergic adverse reaction of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate \npre-existing dyskinesia, as described with other dopamine agonists. \n \nCo-administration of rotigotine (3 mg/24 h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and \npharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15 mg levonorgestrel).  \nInteractions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential, contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during \ntreatment with rotigotine. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of rotigotine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not \nindicate any teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, but embryo-toxicity was observed in rats and mice \nat materno-toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Rotigotine should \nnot be used during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause rotigotine decreases prolactin secretion in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected. Studies \nin rats have shown that rotigotine and/or its metabolite(s) are excreted in breast milk. In the absence of \nhuman data, breast-feeding should be discontinued. \n \nFertility \n \nFor information on fertility studies, please see section 5.3. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRotigotine may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nPatients being treated with rotigotine and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes \nmust be informed not to drive or engage in activities (e.g. operating machines) where impaired \nalertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death until such recurrent episodes \nand somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials comprising a total of 1,307 Leganto- \nand 607 placebo-treated patients, 72.5% of the patients on Leganto and 58.0% of patients on placebo \nreported at least one adverse reaction. \n \nAt the beginning of therapy dopaminergic adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting may occur. \nThese are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued. \n \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in more than 10% of patients treated with Leganto \ntransdermal patch are nausea, vomiting, application site reactions, somnolence, dizziness and \nheadache. \n \nIn trials where the application sites were rotated as reflected in the instructions provided in SmPC and \npackage leaflet, 35.7% of 830 patients using the Leganto transdermal patch, experienced application \nsite reactions. The majority of application site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, limited to \nthe application areas and resulted in discontinuation of treatment with Leganto in only 4.3% of all \nsubjects receiving Leganto. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following table covers adverse drug reactions from the pooled studies mentioned above in patients \nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease and from post-marketing experience.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n \nThe most likely adverse reactions would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a \ndopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, involuntary movements, hallucinations, \nconfusion, convulsions and other signs of central dopaminergic stimulation. \n \nManagement \n \nThere is no known antidote for overdose of dopamine agonists. In case of suspected overdose, removal \nof the patch(es) should be considered because after removal of the patch(es) the active substance input \nis stopped and the plasma concentration of rotigotine decreases rapidly. The patient should be \nmonitored closely, including heart rate, heart rhythm and blood pressure.  \nTreatment of overdose may require general supportive measures to maintain the vital signs. Dialysis \nwould not be expected to be beneficial as rotigotine is not eliminated by dialysis. \n \nIf it is necessary to discontinue rotigotine, this should be done gradually to prevent neuroleptic \nmalignant syndrome. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-parkinson drugs, dopamine agonists; ATC code: N04BC09 \n \nRotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease and Restless Legs Syndrome.  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRotigotine is believed to elicit its beneficial effect on Parkinson\u2019s disease by activation of the D3, D2 \nand D1 receptors of the caudate-putamen in the brain. \n \nThe precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment of RLS is unknown. It is thought that \nrotigotine may exert its activity mainly via dopamine receptors. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nRegarding the functional activity at the various receptor subtypes and their distribution in the brain, \nrotigotine is a D2 and D3 receptor agonist acting also on D1, D4 and D5 receptors. With non-\ndopaminergic receptors, rotigotine showed antagonism at alpha2B and agonism at 5HT1A receptors, \nbut no activity on the 5HT2B receptor.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe effectiveness of rotigotine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's \ndisease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of four pivotal, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n58 \n\nparallel, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies and three studies investigating specific \naspects of Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nTwo pivotal trials (SP512 Part I and SP513 Part I) investigating the effectiveness of rotigotine in \nthe treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease were conducted in patients \nwho were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa na\u00efve or \nprevious L-dopa treatment was \u2264 6 months. The primary outcome assessment was the score for the \nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) component (Part II) plus the Motor Examination component (Part \nIII) of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).  \nEfficacy was determined by the subject\u2019s response to therapy in terms of responder and absolute \npoints improvement in the scores of ADL and Motor Examination combined (UPDRS part II+III). \n \nIn the double blind study SP512 Part I, 177 patients received rotigotine and 96 patients received \nplacebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly increments \nof 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 6 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group \nwere maintained at their optimal dose for 6 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment in 91% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose \nwas the maximal dose allowed i.e. 6 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 48% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine and in 19% of the subjects receiving placebo (Difference 29%, CI95% \n18%; 39%, p<0.0001). With rotigotine, the mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was \n-3.98 points (baseline 29.9 points) whereas in the placebo-treated arm a worsening of 1.31 points was \nobserved (baseline 30.0 points). The difference was 5.28 points and statistically significant \n(p<0.0001).  \n \nIn the double-blind study SP513 Part I, 213 patients received rotigotine, 227 received ropinirole and \n117 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h over 4 weeks. In the \nropinirole group, patients were titrated to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 24 mg/day over 13 \nweeks. Patients in each treatment group were maintained for 6 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment in 92% of the subjects in the rotigotine arm, the optimal dose \nwas the maximal dose allowed i.e. 8 mg/24 h. An improvement of 20% was seen in 52% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine, 68% of the subjects receiving ropinirole and 30% of the subjects \nreceiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 21.7%, CI95% 11.1%; 32.4%, difference \nropinirole versus placebo 38.4%, CI95% 28.1%; 48.6%, difference ropinirole versus rotigotine 16.6%, \nCI95% 7.6%; 25.7%). The mean improvement in the UPDRS score (Parts II + III) was 6.83 points \n(baseline 33.2 points) in the rotigotine arm, 10.78 points in the ropinirole arm (baseline 32.2 points) \nand 2.33 points in the placebo arm (baseline 31.3 points). All differences between the active \ntreatments and placebo were statistically significant. This study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority \nof rotigotine to ropinirole.  \n \nIn a subsequent open-label study (SP824), a multicenter, multinational study, the tolerability of \novernight switching from ropinirole, pramipexole or cabergoline to rotigotine transdermal patch and \nits effect on symptoms in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease have been studied. 116 patients \nwere switched from previous oral therapy to receive up to 8 mg/24 h of rotigotine, among these were \n47 who had been treated with ropinirole up to 9 mg/day, 47 who had been treated with pramipexole up \nto 2 mg/day and 22 who had been treated with cabergoline up to 3 mg/day. Switching to rotigotine \nwas feasible, with minor dose adjustment (median 2 mg/24 h) being necessary in only 2 patients \nswitching from ropinirole, 5 patients from pramipexole and 4 patients from cabergoline. \nImprovements were seen in UPDRS Parts I - IV scores. The safety profile was unchanged from that \nobserved in previous studies. \n \nIn a randomized, open-label study (SP825) in patients with early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, 25 \npatients were randomized to rotigotine treatment and 26 to ropinirole. In both arms treatment was \ntitrated to optimal or maximum dose of 8 mg/24 h or 9 mg/day, respectively. Both treatments showed \nimprovements in early morning motor function and sleep. Motor symptoms (UPDRS Part III) \nimproved by 6.3 \u00b1 1.3 points in rotigotine-treated patients, and by 5.9 \u00b1 1.3 points in the ropinirole-\ngroup after 4 weeks of maintenance. Sleep (PDSS) improved by 4.1 \u00b1 13.8 points for rotigotine-\n\n\n\n59 \n\ntreated patients, and by 2.5 \u00b1 13.5 points for ropinirole-treated patients. The safety profile was \ncomparable, with the exception of application site reactions. \n \nIn studies SP824 and SP825 conducted since the initial comparative trial, rotigotine and ropinirole at \nequivalent doses were shown to have comparable efficacy. \n \nTwo additional pivotal trials (SP650DB and SP515) were conducted in patients who were receiving \nconcomitant levodopa therapy. The primary outcome assessment was the reduction in \u201coff\u201d time \n(hours). Efficacy was determined by the subject\u2019s response to therapy in terms of responder and \nabsolute improvement in the time spent \u201coff\u201d. \n \nIn the double blind study SP650DB, 113 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of \n8 mg/24 h, 109 patients received rotigotine up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/24 h and 119 patients \nreceived placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal doses of rotigotine or placebo in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h. Patients in each treatment group were maintained at \ntheir optimal dose for 6 months. At the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least \n30% was seen in 57% and 55% of the subjects receiving rotigotine 8 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, \nrespectively and in 34% of the subjects receiving placebo (Differences 22% and 21%, respectively, \nCI95% 10%; 35% and 8%; 33%, respectively, p<0.001 for both rotigotine groups). With rotigotine, the \nmean reductions in \u201coff\u201d time were 2.7 and 2.1 hours, respectively whereas in the placebo-treated arm \na reduction of 0.9 hours was observed. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.001 and \np=0.003, respectively). \n \nIn the double-blind study SP515, 201 patients received rotigotine, 200 received pramipexole and \n100 patients received placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 4 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h. In the pramipexole \ngroup, patients received 0,375 mg in the first week, 0.75 mg in the second week and were titrated \nfurther in weekly increments of 0.75 mg to their optimal dose up to a maximum of 4.5 mg/day. \nPatients in each treatment group were maintained for 4 months. \nAt the end of the maintenance treatment an improvement of at least 30% was seen in 60% of the \nsubjects receiving rotigotine, 67% of the subjects receiving pramipexole and 35% of the subjects \nreceiving placebo (Difference rotigotine versus placebo 25%, CI95% 13%; 36%, difference pramipexole \nversus placebo 32%, CI95% 21%; 43%, difference pramipexole versus rotigotine 7%, CI95% -2%; 17%). \nThe mean reduction in the \u201coff\u201d time was 2.5 hours in the rotigotine arm, 2.8 hours in the pramipexole \narm and 0.9 hours in the placebo arm. All differences between the active treatments and placebo were \nstatistically significant.  \n \nA further multinational double-blind study (SP889) was conducted in 287 patients with early or \nadvanced stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease who had unsatisfactory early morning motor symptom control. \n81.5% of these patients were on concomitant levodopa therapy. 190 patients received rotigotine, and \n97 placebo. The patients were titrated to their optimal dose of rotigotine or placebo in weekly \nincrements of 2 mg/24 h starting at 2 mg/24 h to a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 h over 8 weeks, \nfollowed by a maintenance period of 4 weeks. Early morning motor function, assessed by UPDRS part \nIII, and nocturnal sleep disturbances, measured by the modified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Sleep Scale \n(PDSS-2), were co-primary outcome measures. At the end of maintenance, the mean UPDRS part III \nscore had improved by 7.0 points in rotigotine-treated patients (baseline 29.6), and by 3.9 points in the \nplacebo-group (baseline 32.0). Improvements in the mean PDSS-2 total score were 5.9 (rotigotine, \nbaseline 19.3) and 1.9 points (placebo, baseline 20.5). Treatment differences for the coprimary \nvariables were statistically significant (p=0.0002 and p<0.0001). \n \nSkin adhesion \n \nIn a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 2-way, crossover study in 52 outpatients, the skin \nadhesion of the improved room temperature patch formulation was compared to the cold storage \nformulation, using the 8 mg/24 h rotigotine patch. Skin adhesion was measured on 2 consecutive days \nof 24 hours patch application. The improved room temperature patch formulation showed better skin \nadhesion than the cold storage formulation with >90% of patches showing sufficient adhesion (i.e. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n>70% of the patch area adhering) compared to <83%. Comparable skin tolerability was reported for \nboth formulations. The majority of erythema observed was mild and none severe. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing application, rotigotine is continuously released from the transdermal patch and absorbed \nthrough the skin. Steady-state concentrations are reached after one to two days of patch application \nand are maintained at a stable level by once daily application in which the patch is worn for 24 hours. \nRotigotine plasma concentrations increase dose-proportionally over a dose range of 1 mg/24 h to \n24 mg/24 h. \n \nApproximately 45% of the active substance within the patch is released to the skin in 24 hours. The \nabsolute bioavailability after transdermal application is approximately 37%. \n \nRotating the site of patch application may result in day-to-day differences in plasma levels. \nDifferences in bioavailability of rotigotine ranged from 2% (upper arm versus flank) to 46% (shoulder \nversus thigh). However, there is no indication of a relevant impact on the clinical outcome. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro binding of rotigotine to plasma proteins is approximately 92%. \nThe apparent volume of distribution in humans is approximately 84 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRotigotine is metabolised to a great extent. Rotigotine is metabolised by N-dealkylation as well as \ndirect and secondary conjugation. In vitro results indicate that different CYP isoforms are able to \ncatalyse the N-dealkylation of rotigotine. Main metabolites are sulfates and glucuronide conjugates of \nthe parent compound as well as N-desalkyl-metabolites, which are biologically inactive. \nThe information on metabolites is incomplete. \n \nElimination \n \nApproximately 71% of the rotigotine dose is excreted in urine and a smaller part of about 23% is \nexcreted in faeces. \nThe clearance of rotigotine after transdermal administration is approximately 10 l/min and its overall \nelimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile shows a biphasic elimination with an \ninitial half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. \n \nBecause the patch is administered transdermally, no effect of food and gastrointestinal conditions is \nexpected. \n \nSpecial patient groups \n \nBecause therapy with Leganto is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated according to clinical \ntolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the dose based on gender, weight, \nor age is not necessary. \n \nHepatic and renal impairment \n \nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or mild to severe renal impairment, no relevant \nincreases of rotigotine plasma levels were observed. Leganto was not investigated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment.  \nPlasma levels of conjugates of rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites increase with impaired renal \nfunction. However, a contribution of these metabolites to clinical effects is unlikely. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeated dose and long-term toxicity studies, the major effects were associated with the dopamine \nagonist related pharmacodynamic effects and the consequent decrease of prolactin secretion.  \nAfter a single dose of rotigotine, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat \nand monkey was evident, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period. \nRetinal degeneration was observed by transmission microscopy at a dose equivalent to 2.8 times the \nmaximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis in a 3-month study in albino rats. The effects \nwere more pronounced in female rats. Additional studies to further evaluate the specific pathology \nhave not been performed. Retinal degeneration was not observed during the routine histopathological \nevaluation of the eyes in any of the toxicology studies in any species used. The relevance of these \nfindings to humans is not known. \nIn a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell tumours and hyperplasia. Malignant \ntumours were noted predominantly in the uterus of mid- and high-dose females. These changes are \nwell-known effects of dopamine agonists in rats after life-long therapy and assessed as not relevant to \nman. \nThe effects of rotigotine on reproduction have been investigated in rats, rabbits and mice. Rotigotine \nwas not teratogenic in all three species, but was embryotoxic in rats and mice at materno-toxic doses. \nRotigotine did not influence male fertility in rats, but clearly reduced female fertility in rats and mice, \nbecause of the effects on prolactin levels which are particularly significant in rodents. \n \nRotigotine did not induce gene mutations in the Ames test, but did show effects in the in vitro Mouse \nLymphoma Assay with metabolic activation and weaker effects without metabolic activation. This \nmutagenic effect could be attributed to a clastogenic effect of rotigotine. This effect was not confirmed \nin vivo in the Mouse Micronucleus Test in the rat Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) test. Since it \nran more or less parallel with a decreased relative total growth of the cells, it may be related to a \ncytotoxic effect of the compound. Therefore, the relevance of the one positive in vitro mutagenicity \ntest is not known. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Leganto is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Leganto \n3. How to use Leganto \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Leganto \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Leganto is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Leganto is \nLeganto contains the active substance rotigotine.  \n \nIt belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018dopamine agonists\u2019. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain \nwhich is important for movement. \n \nWhat Leganto is used for  \nLeganto is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of: \n\u2022 Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) \u2013 this can be associated with discomfort in your legs or arms, \n\nurges to move around, sleep disturbance and feeling tired or sleepy during the day. These \nsymptoms are either reduced or their duration is shortened with Leganto treatment. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Leganto \n \nDo not use Leganto if: \n\u2022 you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\u2022 you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside \n\nof the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy)  \n\u2022 you need \u2018cardioversion\u2019 (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat). \u2013 \n \nYou must take your Leganto patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or \ncardioversion to avoid skin burns because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on \nafterwards. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you, do not use Leganto. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor \nor pharmacist first. \n \n\n\n\n126 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Leganto. This is because: \n \n\u2022 your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Leganto, especially at the start of the \n\ntreatment. Leganto may affect your blood pressure. \n\u2022 your eyes need checking regularly while using Leganto. If you notice any problems with your \n\neyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. \n\u2022 if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver \n\nproblems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. \n\u2022 you may get skin problems caused by the patch \u2013 see \u2018Skin problems caused by the patch\u2019 in \n\nsection 4. \n\u2022 you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly \u2013 see \u2018Driving and using machines\u2019 in \n\nsection 2. \n\u2022 your symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome may start earlier than usual, be more intense and \n\ninvolve other limbs. If you experience such symptoms either before or after beginning treatment \nwith Leganto, contact your doctor as your treatment may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Leganto or \nwhen your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. \n \nChanges in behaviour and abnormal thinking \nLeganto can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to \ntell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. \nThis is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes \nin your behaviour. \n \nSee \u2018Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking\u2019 in section 4 for more information. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or \neffective in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Leganto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \n \nDo not take the following medicines while using Leganto, \u2013 because they may decrease its effect:  \n\u2022 \u2018anti-psychotic\u2019 medicines \u2013 used to treat certain mental illnesses \n\u2022  metoclopramide \u2013 used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Leganto if you are taking: \n\u2022 sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or \n\ndepression. \n\u2022 medicines that lower blood pressure. Leganto may decrease blood pressure when you stand up \u2013 \n\nthis effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure. \n \nYour doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Leganto. \n \nLeganto with food, drink and alcohol \nBecause rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way \nthis medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to \ndrink alcohol while using Leganto. \n \n\n\n\n127 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Leganto if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the \nunborn baby are not known.  \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Leganto. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast \nmilk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLeganto may make you feel very sleepy, and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not \ndrive. In isolated cases, people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. \n \nAlso do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy \u2013 or do anything else which may put others \nor yourself at risk of serious injury. \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) \nSodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and \nbronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). \n \n \n3. How to use Leganto \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nWhich strength patches to use \nLeganto is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours.The \nstrengths are 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h for the treatment of Restless Leg Syndrome. \n \n\u2022 Your starting dose will be one, 1 mg/24 h patch each day.  \n\u2022 From the second week, your daily dose may be increased by 1 mg each week until you get to the \n\nright maintenance dose for you. This is when you and your doctor agree that the symptoms are \nbeing controlled well enough and the side effects of the medicines are acceptable. \n\n\u2022 Please follow the instructions of the prescriber carefully. \n\u2022 The maximum dose is 3 mg per day. \n \nIf you have to stop taking this medicine, see \u2018If you stop using Leganto\u2019 in section 3. \n \nHow to use the Leganto patches  \nLeganto is a patch that is put on the skin. \n\u2022 Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. \n\u2022 Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  \n\u2022 Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one. \n\u2022 Change the patches at about the same time every day. \n\u2022 Do not cut the Leganto patches into pieces. \n \n\n\n\n128 \n\nWhere to stick the patch \n \nPut the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, \nhealthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on \nthe pictures opposite:  \n\u2022 Shoulder or upper arm. \n\u2022 Belly. \n\u2022 Flank (your side, between the ribs \n\nand hips). \n\u2022 Thigh or hip. \n\n \n \nTo avoid skin irritation  \n\u2022 Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For \n\nexample, put it on the right side of your body one day, then \non the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper \nbody one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  \n\n\u2022 Do not stick Leganto on the same area of skin twice \nwithin 14 days. \n\n\u2022 Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin \u2013 or on \nskin that is red or irritated. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see \u2018Skin problems caused by \nthe patch\u2019 in section 4 for more information.  \n \nTo prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off \n\u2022 Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. \n\u2022 Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. \n\nAlso do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  \n\u2022 If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days \n\nbefore sticking the patch there.  \n\u2022 If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. \n \nIf the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day \u2013 then replace the patch at the usual \ntime. \n \n\u2022 Do not let the area of the patch get hot \u2013 for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, \n\nheating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you \nthink that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\u2022 Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or \nexercising. \n\n\u2022 If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is \nbecause it may change the colour of the skin. \n\n \nHow to use the patch \n\u2022 Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  \n\u2022 Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you \n\nhave removed any old patch. \n\u2022 Stick the Leganto patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the \n\nrelease liner. \n \n\n\n\n129 \n\n1. \nTo open the sachet, hold the sachet \nin both hands. \n\n \n2.  \nPeel apart the foil. \n\n \n3. \nOpen the sachet. \n\n \n4. \nTake the patch out of the sachet. \n\n \n5.  \nThe sticky side of the patch is \ncovered by a transparent release \nliner.  \n\u2022 Hold the patch in both hands \n\nwith the release liner facing \nyou.  \n\n6. \n\u2022 Bend the patch in half.  \nThis makes the S-shaped break in \nthe liner open up. \n\n \n7. \n\u2022 Peel off one side of the \n\nrelease liner. \n\u2022 Do not touch the sticky side \n\nof the patch with your \nfingers. \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n8. \n\u2022 Hold the other half of the \n\nrigid release liner. \n\u2022 Then put the sticky half of \n\nthe patch onto your skin. \n\u2022 Press the sticky side of the \n\npatch firmly into place. \n \n\n9. \nFold back the other half of the \npatch and remove the other side of \nthe release liner. \n\n \n10. \n\u2022 Press the patch down firmly \n\nwith the palm of your hand.  \n\u2022 Keep it pressed for about \n\n30 seconds.  \nThis makes sure the patch is \ntouching the skin and the edges \nstick down well. \n\n \n\n \n\n11. \nWash your hands with soap and \nwater straight after handling the \npatch. \n\n \n\n \nHow to take off a used patch \n\u2022 Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. \n\u2022 Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays \n\non your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. \n\u2022 Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids \u2013 such as nail polish remover. These may irritate \n\nyour skin. \n \nIf you use more Leganto than you should \nUsing higher doses of Leganto than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling \nsick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real \n(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.  \nIn such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do \n \nIf you forget to change the patch at your usual time \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. \n\nTake off the old patch and use a new one.  \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as \n\nsoon as you remember.  \n \nIn both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Leganto \nDo not stop using Leganto without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical \ncondition called \u2018neuroleptic malignant syndrome\u2019 which could be life-threatening. The signs include: \nloss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate \n(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \nIf your doctor says you should stop Leganto,the daily dose should be lowered gradually: \n\u2022 Restless Legs Syndrome \u2013 lowered by 1 mg every other day. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you notice any side effects. \n \nSide effects more likely at the start of treatment  \nYou may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or \nmoderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are \nworried about them. \n \nSkin problems caused by the patch \n\u2022 You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been \u2013 these reactions are \n\nusually mild or moderate.  \n\u2022 The reactions normally go away after a few hours \u2013 once you remove the patch. \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. \n\nAlso do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. \n\u2022 Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused \n\nby the patch.  \n\u2022 To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, \n\nand only use the same area again after 14 days. \n \n\nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Leganto or \nwhen your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. \n \nChanges in behaviour and abnormal thinking \nTell your doctor if you get any changes in behaviour, thinking or both, that are listed below. \nThey will discuss ways of managing or reducing symptoms.  \n \nYou may find it helpful to also tell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine \nand ask them to read this leaflet.

What you need to know before you use Leganto \n3. How to use Leganto \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Leganto \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Leganto is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Leganto is \nLeganto contains the active substance rotigotine.  \n \nIt belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018dopamine agonists\u2019. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain \nwhich is important for movement.  \n \nWhat Leganto is used for  \nLeganto is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of: \n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 Leganto can be used on its own or with another medicine called \n\nlevodopa. \n\u2022 Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) \u2013 this can be associated with discomfort in your legs or arms, \n\nurge to move around, sleep disturbance and feeling tired or sleepy during the day. These \nsymptoms are either reduced or their duration is shortened with Leganto treatment.  \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Leganto \n \nDo not use Leganto if: \n\u2022 you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\u2022 you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside \n\nof the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy)  \n\u2022 you need \u2018cardioversion\u2019 (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat).  \n\n \nYou must take your Leganto patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or \ncardioversion to avoid skin burns because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on \nafterwards. \n \n\n\n\n137 \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, do not use Leganto. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse first. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Leganto. This is because: \n\u2022 your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Leganto, especially at the start of the \n\ntreatment. Leganto may affect your blood pressure. \n\u2022 your eyes need checking regularly while using Leganto. If you notice any problems with your \n\neyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. \n\u2022 if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver \n\nproblems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. \n\u2022 you may get skin problems caused by the patch \u2013 see \u2018Skin problems caused by the patch\u2019 in \n\nsection 4. \n\u2022 you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly \u2013 see \u2018Driving and using machines\u2019 in \n\nsection 2. \n\u2022 your symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome may start earlier than usual, be more intense and \n\ninvolve other limbs. If you experience such symptoms either before or after beginning treatment \nwith Leganto, contact your doctor as your treatment may need to be adjusted. \n\n \nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Leganto or \nwhen your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. \n \nChanges in behaviour and abnormal thinking \nLeganto can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to \ntell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. \nThis is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes \nin your behaviour. \n \nThese include:  \n\u2022 unusual urges or cravings which you cannot resist and that could harm yourself or others \u2013 the \n\nsymptoms are mainly seen in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 abnormal thinking or behaviour \u2013 most of the symptoms occur more frequently in patients with \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease. \n \nSee \u2018Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking\u2019 in section 4 for more information. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or \neffective in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Leganto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \n \nIf you are treated with Leganto and levodopa at the same time, some side effects may get more \nserious. This includes seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), movements you \ncannot control related to Parkinson\u2019s disease (\u2018dyskinesia\u2019), and swelling of legs and feet. \n \nDo not take the following medicines while using Leganto \u2013 because they may decrease its effect  \n\u2022 \u2018anti-psychotic\u2019 medicines \u2013 used to treat certain mental illnesses \n\u2022 metoclopramide \u2013 used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Leganto if you are taking: \n\u2022 sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or \n\ndepression. \n\n\n\n138 \n\n\u2022 medicines that lower blood pressure. Leganto may decrease blood pressure when you stand up \u2013 \nthis effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure. \n\n \nYour doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Leganto. \n \nLeganto with food, drink and alcohol \nBecause rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way \nthis medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to \ndrink alcohol while using Leganto. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Leganto if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the \nunborn baby are not known.  \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Leganto.This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast \nmilk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLeganto may make you feel very sleepy and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not \ndrive. In isolated cases, people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. \n \nAlso do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy \u2013 or do anything else which may put others \nor yourself at risk of serious injury. \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) \nSodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and \nbronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). \n \n \n3. How to use Leganto \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nWhich strength patches to use \nThe dose of Leganto will depend on your illness \u2013 see below. \n \nLeganto is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The \nstrengths are 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h, 3 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h. The patches of 1 \nmg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h are used for the treatment of Restless Leg Syndrome, while the patches of  \n4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h are used for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The patches of \n2 mg/24 h are used for the treatment of Parkinson\u00b4s disease and Restless Leg Syndrome. \n\u2022 You may have to use more than one patch to reach your dose, as prescribed by your doctor. \n\u2022 For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h (doses prescribed by your doctor above the available \n\nstrengths), multiple patches must be applied to achieve the final dose. For example the daily \ndose of 10 mg may be reached by applying one patch of 6 mg/24 h and one patch of 4 mg/24 h.  \n\n\u2022 The patches should not be cut into pieces.  \n \nTreatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease \nPatients not taking levodopa \u2013 early stage of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 Your starting daily dose will be one 2 mg/24 h patch each day.  \n\u2022 From the second week your daily dose may be increased by 2 mg each week \u2013 until you get to \n\nthe right maintenance dose for you.  \n\n\n\n139 \n\n\u2022 For most patients, the right dose is between 6 mg and 8 mg each day. This is normally reached \nwithin 3 to 4 weeks. \n\n\u2022 The maximum dose is 8 mg each day. \n \n\nPatients taking levodopa \u2013 advanced stage of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 Your starting daily dose will be one 4 mg/24 h patch each day.  \n\u2022 From the second week your daily dose will be increased by 2 mg each week \u2013 until you get to \n\nthe right maintenance dose for you.  \n\u2022 For most patients, the right dose is between 8 mg and 16 mg each day. This is normally reached \n\nwithin 3 to 7 weeks. \n\u2022 The maximum dose is 16 mg each day. \n\n \nTreatment of Restless Legs Syndrome \n\u2022 Your starting dose will be one 1 mg/24 h patch each day.  \n\u2022 From the second week, your daily dose may be increased by 1 mg each week \u2013 until you get to \n\nthe right maintenance dose for you. This is when you and your doctor agree that the symptoms \nare being controlled well enough and the side effects of the medicines are acceptable. \n\n\u2022 The maximum dose is 3 mg per day. \n \nIf you have to stop taking this medicine, see \u2018If you stop using Leganto\u2019 in section 3. \n \nHow to use the Leganto patches: \nLeganto is a patch that is put on the skin. \n\u2022 Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. \n\u2022 Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  \n\u2022 Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  \n\u2022 Change the patches at about the same time every day. \n\u2022 Do not cut the Leganto patches into pieces. \n \nWhere to stick the patch \nPut the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, \nhealthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on \nthe pictures opposite:  \n\u2022 Shoulder or upper arm. \n\u2022 Belly. \n\u2022 Flank (your side, between the ribs \n\nand hips). \n\u2022 Thigh or hip. \n\n  \n \nTo avoid skin irritation  \n\u2022 Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For \n\nexample, put it on the right side of your body one day, then \non the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper \nbody one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  \n\n\u2022 Do not stick Leganto on the same area of skin twice \nwithin 14 days. \n\n\u2022 Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin \u2013 or on \nskin that is red or irritated. \n\n \n\n \nIf you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see \u2018Skin problems caused by \nthe patch\u2019 in section 4 for more information. \n \nTo prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off \n\u2022 Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. \n\n\n\n140 \n\n\u2022 Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. \nAlso do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  \n\n\u2022 If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days \nbefore sticking the patch there. \n\n\u2022 If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. \n \nIf the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day \u2013 then replace the patch at the usual \ntime. \n \n\u2022 Do not let the area of the patch get hot \u2013 for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, \n\nheating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you \nthink that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\u2022 Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or \nexercising. \n\n\u2022 If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is \nbecause it may change the colour of the skin. \n\n \nHow to use the patch \n\u2022 Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  \n\u2022 Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you \n\nhave removed any old patch. \n\u2022 Stick the Leganto patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the \n\nrelease liner. \n \n1. \nTo open the sachet, hold the \nsachet in both hands.  \n\n \n2.  \nPeel apart the foil. \n\n \n3. \nOpen the sachet. \n\n \n4. \nTake the patch out of the sachet. \n\n \n\n\n\n141 \n\n5.  \nThe sticky side of the patch is \ncovered by a transparent release \nliner.  \n\u2022 Hold the patch in both hands \n\nwith the release liner facing \nyou.  \n\n6. \n\u2022 Bend the patch in half.  \nThis makes the S-shaped break in \nthe liner open up. \n\n \n7. \n\u2022 Peel off one side of the \n\nrelease liner.  \n\u2022 Do not touch the sticky \n\nside of the patch with your \nfingers. \n\n \n8. \n\u2022 Hold the other half of the \n\nrigid release liner.  \n\u2022 Then put the sticky half of \n\nthe patch onto your skin.  \n\u2022 Press the sticky side of the \n\npatch firmly into place. \n \n\n9. \nFold back the other half of the \npatch and remove the other side \nof the release liner. \n\n \n10. \n\u2022 Press the patch down \n\nfirmly with the palm of \nyour hand.  \n\n\u2022 Keep it pressed for about \n30 seconds.  \n\nThis makes sure the patch is \ntouching the skin and the edges \nstick down well. \n\n \n\n11. \nWash your hands with soap and \nwater straight after handling the \npatch. \n\n \n\n \nHow to take off a used patch \n\u2022 Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. \n\u2022 Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays \n\non your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. \n\n\n\n142 \n\n\u2022 Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids \u2013 such as nail polish remover. These may irritate \nyour skin. \n\n \nIf you use more Leganto than you should \nUsing higher doses of Leganto than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling \nsick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real \n(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.  \nIn such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. \n \nIf you forget to change the patch at your usual time \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. \n\nTake off the old patch and use a new one.  \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as \n\nsoon as you remember.  \n \nIn both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Leganto \nDo not stop using Leganto without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical \ncondition called \u2018neuroleptic malignant syndrome\u2019 which could be life-threatening. The signs include: \nloss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate \n(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  \n \nIf your doctor says you should stop Leganto, the daily dose should be lowered gradually: \n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 lowered by 2 mg every other day. \n\u2022 Restless Legs Syndrome \u2013 lowered by 1 mg every other day. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you notice any side effects. \n \nSide effects more likely at the start of treatment  \nYou may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or \nmoderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are \nworried about them. \n \nSkin problems caused by the patch \n\u2022 You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been \u2013 these reactions are \n\nusually mild or moderate. \n\u2022 The reactions normally go away after a few hours \u2013 once you remove the patch. \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. \n\nAlso do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. \n\u2022 Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused \n\nby the patch.  \n\u2022 To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, \n\nand only use the same area again after 14 days. \n \nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Leganto or \nwhen your dose is increased.

Leganto may decrease blood pressure when you stand up \u2013 \n\nthis effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure. \n \nYour doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Leganto. \n \n\n\n\n151 \n\nLeganto with food, drink and alcohol \nBecause rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way \nthis medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to \ndrink alcohol while using Leganto. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Leganto if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the \nunborn baby are not known.  \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Leganto. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast \nmilk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLeganto may make you feel very sleepy, and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not \ndrive. In isolated cases people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. \n \nAlso do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy \u2013 or do anything else which may put others \nor yourself at risk of serious injury. \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) \nSodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and \nbronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). \n \n \n3. How to use Leganto \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nWhich strength patches to use \nThe dose of Leganto will depend on your illness \u2013 see below. \n \nLeganto is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The \nstrengths are 2 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease.  \n \n\u2022 You may have to use more than one patch to reach your dose, as prescribed by your doctor. \n\u2022 For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h (doses prescribed by your doctor above the available \n\nstrengths), multiple patches must be applied to achieve the final dose. For example a daily dose \nof 10 mg/24 h may be reached by applying one patch of 6 mg/24 h and one patch of 4 mg/24 h. \n\n\u2022 The patches should not be cut into pieces.  \n \nTreatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease \nPatients not taking levodopa \u2013 early stage of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 Your starting daily dose will be one 2 mg/24 h patch each day.  \n\u2022 From the second week your daily dose may be increased by 2 mg each week \u2013 until you get to \n\nthe right maintenance dose for you.  \n\u2022 For most patients, the right dose is between 6 mg and 8 mg each day. This is normally reached \n\nwithin 3 to 4 weeks. \n\u2022 The maximum dose is 8 mg each day. \n\n \nPatients taking levodopa \u2013 advanced stage of Parkinson\u2019s disease \n\u2022 Your starting daily dose will be one 4 mg/24 h patch each day.  \n\u2022 From the second week your daily dose will be increased by 2 mg each week \u2013 until you get to \n\nthe right maintenance dose for you.  \n\n\n\n152 \n\n\u2022 For most patients, the right dose is between 8 mg and 16 mg each day. This is normally reached \nwithin 3 to 7 weeks. \n\n\u2022 The maximum dose is 16 mg each day. \n \nIf you have to stop taking this medicine, see \u2018If you stop using Leganto\u2019 in section 3. \n \nHow to use the Leganto patches: \nLeganto is a patch that is put on the skin. \n\u2022 Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. \n\u2022 Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day.  \n\u2022 Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  \n\u2022 Change the patches at about the same time every day. \n\u2022 Do not cut the Leganto patches into pieces. \n \nWhere to stick the patch \nPut the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, \nhealthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on \nthe pictures opposite:  \n\u2022 Shoulder or upper arm. \n\u2022 Belly. \n\u2022 Flank (your side, between the ribs \n\nand hips). \n\u2022 Thigh or hip. \n\n \n \n\n \nTo avoid skin irritation  \n\u2022 Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For \n\nexample, put it on the right side of your body one day, then \non the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper \nbody one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  \n\n\u2022 Do not stick Leganto on the same area of skin twice \nwithin 14 days. \n\n\u2022 Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin \u2013 or on \nskin that is red or irritated. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see Skin problems caused by the \npatch\u2019 in section 4 for more information. \n \nTo prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off \n\u2022 Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. \n\u2022 Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. \n\nAlso do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  \n\u2022 If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days \n\nbefore sticking the patch there. \n\u2022 If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. \n \nIf the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day \u2013 then replace the patch at the usual \ntime. \n \n\u2022 Do not let the area of the patch get hot \u2013 for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, \n\nheating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you \nthink that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\u2022 Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or \nexercising. \n\n\u2022 If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is \nbecause it may change the colour of the skin. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \nHow to use the patch \n\u2022 Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  \n\u2022 Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you \n\nhave removed any old patch. \n\u2022 Stick the Leganto patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the \n\nrelease liner. \n \n1. \nTo open the sachet, hold the \nsachet in both hands.  \n\n \n2.  \nPeel apart the foil. \n\n \n3. \nOpen the sachet. \n\n \n4. \nTake the patch out of the \nsachet. \n\n \n5.  \nThe sticky side of the patch is \ncovered by a transparent \nrelease liner.  \n\u2022 Hold the patch in both \n\nhands with the release \nliner facing you.  \n\n6. \n\u2022 Bend the patch in half.  \nThis makes the S-shaped \nbreak in the liner open up. \n\n \n\n\n\n154 \n\n7. \n\u2022 Peel off one side of the \n\nrelease liner.  \n\u2022 Do not touch the sticky \n\nside of the patch with \nyour fingers. \n\n \n8. \n\u2022 Hold the other half of \n\nthe rigid release liner.  \n\u2022 Then put the sticky half \n\nof the patch onto your \nskin.  \n\n\u2022 Press the sticky side of \nthe patch firmly into \nplace. \n\n \n\n9. \nFold back the other half of the \npatch and remove the other \nside of the release liner. \n\n \n10. \n\u2022 Press the patch down \n\nfirmly with the palm of \nyour hand.  \n\n\u2022 Keep it pressed for \nabout 30 seconds.  \n\nThis makes sure the patch is \ntouching the skin and the \nedges stick down well. \n\n \n\n11. \nWash your hands with soap \nand water straight after \nhandling the patch. \n\n \n\n \nHow to take off a used patch \n\u2022 Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. \n\u2022 Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays \n\non your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. \n\u2022 Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids such as nail polish remover. These may irritate \n\nyour skin. \n \nIf you use more Leganto than you should \nUsing higher doses of Leganto than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling \nsick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real \n(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions. In \nsuch cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. \n \nIf you forget to change the patch at your usual time \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. \n\nTake off the old patch and use a new one.  \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as \n\nsoon as you remember. \n \n\n\n\n155 \n\nIn both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Leganto \nDo not stop using Leganto without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical \ncondition called \u2018neuroleptic malignant syndrome\u2019 which could be life-threatening. The signs include: \nloss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate \n(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  \n \nIf your doctor says you should stop Leganto, the daily dose should be lowered gradually: \n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 lowered by 2 mg every other day. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you notice any side effects. \n \nSide effects more likely at the start of treatment \nYou may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or \nmoderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are \nworried about them. \n \nSkin problems caused by the patch \n\u2022 You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been \u2013 these reactions are \n\nusually mild or moderate. \n\u2022 The reactions normally go away after a few hours \u2013 once you remove the patch. \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. \n\nAlso do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. \n\u2022 Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused \n\nby the patch.  \n\u2022 To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, \n\nand only use the same area again after 14 days. \n \nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Leganto or \nwhen your dose is increased.

What Leganto is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Leganto is \nLeganto contains the active substance rotigotine.  \n \nIt belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018dopamine agonists\u2019. Dopamine is a messenger in the brain \nwhich is important for movement. \n \nWhat Leganto is used for \nLeganto is used in adults to treat the signs and symptoms of:  \n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 Leganto can be used on its own or with another medicine called \n\nlevodopa. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Leganto \n \nDo not use Leganto if: \n\u2022 you are allergic to rotigotine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n\u2022 you need to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (diagnostic pictures of the inside \n\nof the body, created using magnetic rather than x-ray energy)  \n\u2022 you need \u2018cardioversion\u2019 (specific treatment for abnormal heart beat).  \n\n \nYou must take your Leganto patch off just before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or \ncardioversion to avoid skin burns because the patch contains aluminium. You can put a new patch on \nafterwards. \n \n\n\n\n162 \n\nIf any of the above apply to you, do not use Leganto. If you are not sure about this, talk to your doctor \nor pharmacist first. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Leganto. This is because \n\u2022 your blood pressure needs checking regularly while using Leganto, especially at the start of the \n\ntreatment. Leganto may affect your blood pressure. \n\u2022 your eyes need checking regularly while using Leganto. If you notice any problems with your \n\neyesight between checks, talk to your doctor straight away. \n\u2022 if you have serious liver problems, your doctor may need to change the dose. If your liver \n\nproblems get worse during treatment, talk to your doctor straight away. \n\u2022 you may get skin problems caused by the patch \u2013 see \u2018Skin problems caused by the patch\u2019 in \n\nsection 4. \n\u2022 you may feel very sleepy or fall asleep suddenly \u2013 see \u2018Driving and using machines\u2019 in \n\nsection 2. \n \nIf you experience these symptoms after beginning treatment with Leganto, contact your doctor. \n \nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness. This can happen especially when you start using Leganto or \nwhen your dose is increased. Tell your doctor if you lose consciousness or feel dizzy. \n \nChanges in behaviour and abnormal thinking \nLeganto can cause side effects that change your behaviour (how you act). You may find it helpful to \ntell a member of your family or carer that you are using this medicine and ask them to read this leaflet. \nThis is so that your family or carer can tell you, or your doctor, if they are worried about any changes \nin your behaviour. \n \nThese include:  \n\u2022 unusual urges or cravings which you cannot resist and that could harm yourself or others \n\u2022 abnormal thinking or behaviour. \n \nSee \u2018Changes to your behaviour and abnormal thinking\u2019 in section 4 for more information. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children below 18 years of age because it is not known if it is safe or \neffective in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Leganto \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \n \nIf you are treated with Leganto and levodopa at the same time, some side effects may get more \nserious. This includes seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), movements you \ncannot control related to Parkinson\u2019s disease (\u2018dyskinesia\u2019), and swelling of legs and feet. \n \nDo not take the following medicines while using Leganto \u2013 because they may decrease its effect:  \n\u2022 \u2018anti-psychotic\u2019 medicines \u2013 used to treat certain mental illnesses \n\u2022  metoclopramide \u2013 used to treat nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting.  \n \nTalk to your doctor before using Leganto if you are taking: \n\u2022 sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or medicines used to treat mental illness or \n\ndepression. \n\u2022 medicines that lower blood pressure. Leganto may decrease blood pressure when you stand up \u2013 \n\nthis effect may be worsened by the medicines used to lower blood pressure.  \n \n\n\n\n163 \n\nYour doctor will let you know if it is safe to keep taking these medicines while using Leganto. \n \nLeganto with food, drink and alcohol \nBecause rotigotine enters your bloodstream through your skin, food or drink does not affect the way \nthis medicine is absorbed by the body. You should discuss with your doctor if it is safe for you to \ndrink alcohol while using Leganto. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDo not use Leganto if you are pregnant. This is because the effects of rotigotine on pregnancy and the \nunborn baby are not known.  \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Leganto. This is because rotigotine may pass into your breast \nmilk and affect your baby. It is also likely to lower the amount of milk you produce. \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nLeganto may make you feel very sleepy and you may fall asleep very suddenly. If this happens, do not \ndrive. In isolated cases people have fallen asleep while driving and this has caused accidents. \n \nAlso do not use tools or machines if you feel very sleepy \u2013 or do anything else which may put others \nor yourself at risk of serious injury. \n \nLeganto contains sodium metabisulphite (E223) \nSodium metabisulphite (E223) may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and \nbronchospasm (breathing distress caused by narrowing of the airways). \n \n \n3. How to use Leganto \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nWhich strength patches to use \nThe dose of Lengato will depend on your illness \u2013 see below. \n  \nLeganto is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours. The \nstrengths are 2 mg/24 h, 4 mg/24 h, 6 mg/24 h and 8 mg/24 h for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. \nYou may have to use more than one patch to reach your dose, as prescribed by your doctor. \n \nThe Leganto treatment initiation pack contains 4 different packages (one for each strength) with \n7 patches in each package. These packages are usually needed for the first four weeks of therapy, but \ndepending on your response to Leganto, you may not need to use all of the dose packages included or \nyou may need additional higher doses after week 4, which are not covered by this package.  \n \nOn the first day of treatment, start with Leganto 2 mg (package marked \u201cWeek 1\u201d), and use one \nLeganto 2 mg transdermal patch daily. You should take Leganto 2 mg for 7 days \n(e.g. if you start on a Sunday, switch to the next dose on the following Sunday.).  \nAt the beginning of the second week, you should take Leganto 4 mg (package marked with \n\u201cWeek 2\u201d). \nAt the beginning of the third week, you should take Leganto 6 mg (package marked with \u201cWeek 3\u201d). \nAt the beginning of the fourth week, you should take Leganto 8 mg (package marked with \u201cWeek 4\u201d). \n \nThe right dose for you will depend on your needs. \n \n\n\n\n164 \n\n4 mg of Leganto every day may be an effective dose for some patients. For most patients with early \nstage Parkinson\u2019s disease, the right dose is reached within 3 or 4 weeks, at doses of 6 mg per day or \n8 mg per day respectively. The maximum dose is 8 mg per day. For most patients with advanced-stage \nParkinson\u2019s disease the right dose is reached within 3 to 7 weeks, at doses of 8 mg per day up to a \nmaximum dose of 16 mg per day. For doses higher than 8 mg/24 h (doses prescribed by your doctor \nabove the available strengths), multiple patches must be applied to achieve the final dose. For \nexample, a daily dose of 14 mg may be reached by applying one patch of 6 mg/24 h and one patch of 8 \nmg/24 h and likewise, a daily dose of 16 mg can be reached by applying two patches of 8 mg/24 h. \n \nIf you have to stop taking this medicine, see \u2018If you stop using Leganto\u2019 in section 3. \n \nHow to use the Leganto patches: \nLeganto is a patch that is put on the skin. \n\u2022 Make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. \n\u2022 Stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day. \n\u2022 Leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one.  \n\u2022 Change the patch at about the same time every day. \n\u2022 Do not cut the Leganto patches into pieces. \n \nWhere to stick the patch \nPut the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, \nhealthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on \nthe pictures opposite:  \n\u2022 Shoulder or upper arm. \n\u2022 Belly. \n\u2022 Flank (your side, between the ribs \n\nand hips). \n\u2022 Thigh or hip. \n\n  \n \nTo avoid skin irritation  \n\u2022 Stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. For \n\nexample, put it on the right side of your body one day, then \non the left side of your body the next day. Or on your upper \nbody one day, then on your lower body the day after that.  \n\n\u2022 Do not stick Leganto on the same area of skin twice \nwithin 14 days. \n\n\u2022 Do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin \u2013 or on \nskin that is red or irritated. \n\n \n\n \n\nIf you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see \u2018Skin problems caused by \nthe patch\u2019 in section 4 for more information. \n \nTo prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off \n\u2022 Do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. \n\u2022 Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. \n\nAlso do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing.  \n\u2022 If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days \n\nbefore sticking the patch there. \n\u2022 If the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. \n \nIf the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day \u2013 then replace the patch at the usual \ntime. \n \n\n\n\n165 \n\n\u2022 Do not let the area of the patch get hot \u2013 for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, \nheating pads or hot-water bottles. This is because the medicine may be released faster. If you \nthink that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\u2022 Always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or \nexercising. \n\n\u2022 If the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. This is \nbecause it may change the colour of the skin. \n\n \nHow to use the patch \n\u2022 Each patch is packed in a separate sachet.  \n\u2022 Before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you \n\nhave removed any old patch. \n\u2022 Stick the Leganto patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the \n\nrelease liner. \n \n1. \nTo open the sachet, hold the \nsachet in both hands.  \n\n \n2.  \nPeel apart the foil. \n\n \n3. \nOpen the sachet. \n\n \n4. \nTake the patch out of the sachet. \n\n \n5.  \nThe sticky side of the patch is \ncovered by a transparent release \nliner.  \n\u2022 Hold the patch in both \n\nhands with the release liner \nfacing you.  \n\n\n\n166 \n\n6. \n\u2022 Bend the patch in half.  \nThis makes the S-shaped break \nin the liner open up. \n\n \n7. \n\u2022 Peel off one side of the \n\nrelease liner.  \n\u2022 Do not touch the sticky \n\nside of the patch with \nyour fingers. \n\n \n8. \n\u2022 Hold the other half of the \n\nrigid release liner.  \n\u2022 Then put the sticky half \n\nof the patch onto your \nskin.  \n\n\u2022 Press the sticky side of \nthe patch firmly into \nplace. \n\n \n\n9. \nFold back the other half of the \npatch and remove the other side \nof the release liner. \n\n \n10. \n\u2022 Press the patch down \n\nfirmly with the palm of \nyour hand.  \n\n\u2022 Keep it pressed for about \n30 seconds.  \n\nThis makes sure the patch is \ntouching the skin and the edges \nstick down well. \n\n \n\n11. \nWash your hands with soap and \nwater straight after handling the \npatch. \n\n \n\n \n \nHow to take off a used patch \n\u2022 Slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. \n\u2022 Gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. This will remove any stickiness that stays \n\non your skin. You can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. \n\u2022 Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids \u2013 such as nail polish remover. These may irritate \n\nyour skin. \n \n\n\n\n167 \n\nIf you use more Leganto than you should \nUsing higher doses of Leganto than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling \nsick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real \n(hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions.  \nIn such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. They will tell you what to do. \n \nIf you have used a different patch (e.g. Leganto 4 mg/24 h instead of Leganto 2 mg/24 h) than your \ndoctor told you to, contact your doctor or hospital for advice immediately, and follow their advice on \nchanges of patches. \nIf you have any unpleasant reactions, contact your doctor. \n \nIf you forget to change the patch at your usual time \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. \n\nTake off the old patch and use a new one.  \n\u2022 If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as \n\nsoon as you remember.  \n \nIn both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. Do not use a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Leganto \nDo not stop using Leganto without talking to your doctor. A sudden stop could lead to a medical \ncondition called \u2018neuroleptic malignant syndrome\u2019 which could be life-threatening. The signs include: \nloss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate \n(tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma).  \n \nIf your doctor says you should stop Leganto, the daily dose of Leganto should be lowered gradually: \n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 lowered by 2 mg every other day. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you notice any side effects. \n \nSide effects more likely at the start of treatment \nYou may feel sick (nausea) and vomit at the start of treatment. These effects are usually mild or \nmoderate and only last for a short time. Talk to your doctor if they last for a long time or if you are \nworried about them. \n \nSkin problems caused by the patch \n\u2022 You may get redness and itching on the skin where the patch has been \u2013 these reactions are \n\nusually mild or moderate. \n\u2022 The reactions normally go away after a few hours \u2013 once you remove the patch. \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you have a skin reaction that lasts longer than a few days or is severe. \n\nAlso do this if it spreads outside the area of skin that was covered by the patch. \n\u2022 Avoid sunlight and solarium exposure on areas of skin showing any kind of skin reaction caused \n\nby the patch.  \n\u2022 To help avoid the skin reactions, you should put the patch on a different area of skin every day, \n\nand only use the same area again after 14 days. \n \nLoss of consciousness can occur \nLeganto can cause loss of consciousness.

"always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. which strength patches to use leganto is available in different strength patches which release the medicine over 24 hours.the strengths are 1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h and 3 mg/24 h for the treatment of restless leg syndrome. your starting dose will be one, 1 mg/24 h patch each day. from the second week, your daily dose may be increased by 1 mg each week until you get to the right maintenance dose for you. this is when you and your doctor agree that the symptoms are being controlled well enough and the side effects of the medicines are acceptable. please follow the instructions of the prescriber carefully. the maximum dose is 3 mg per day. if you have to stop taking this medicine, see 'if you stop using leganto' in section 3. how to use the leganto patches leganto is a patch that is put on the skin. make sure that you take the old patch off before putting on a new one. stick the new patch on a different area of the skin each day. leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours, then take it off and put on a new one. change the patches at about the same time every day. do not cut the leganto patches into pieces. where to stick the patch put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, healthy skin on the following areas as shown in grey on the pictures opposite: shoulder or upper arm. belly. flank (your side, between the ribs and hips). thigh or hip. to avoid skin irritation stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day. for example, put it on the right side of your body one day, then on the left side of your body the next day. or on your upper body one day, then on your lower body the day after that. do not stick leganto on the same area of skin twice within 14 days. do not stick the patch on broken or damaged skin or on skin that is red or irritated. if you still get problems with your skin because of the patch, please see 'skin problems caused by the patch' in section 4 for more information. to prevent the patch becoming loose or falling off do not put the patch in an area where it can be rubbed by tight clothing. do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products where you will put the patch. also do not use them on or near a patch you are already wearing. if you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least 3 days before sticking the patch there. if the edges of the patch lift, the patch may be taped down with adhesive medical tape. if the patch falls off, put on a new patch for the rest of the day then replace the patch at the usual time. do not let the area of the patch get hot for example too much sunlight, saunas, hot baths, heating pads or hot-water bottles. this is because the medicine may be released faster. if you think that too much heat has been applied, contact your doctor or pharmacist. always check that the patch has not fallen off after activities such as bathing, showering or exercising. if the patch has irritated your skin, keep that area protected from direct sunlight. this is because it may change the colour of the skin. how to use the patch each patch is packed in a separate sachet. before opening the sachet decide where you are going to stick this new patch and check you have removed any old patch. stick the leganto patch onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the release liner. 1. to open the sachet, hold the sachet in both hands. 2. peel apart the foil. 3. open the sachet. 4. take the patch out of the sachet. 5. the sticky side of the patch is covered by a transparent release liner. hold the patch in both hands with the release liner facing you. 6. bend the patch in half. this makes the s-shaped break in the liner open up. 7. peel off one side of the release liner. do not touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers. 8. hold the other half of the rigid release liner. then put the sticky half of the patch onto your skin. press the sticky side of the patch firmly into place. 9. fold back the other half of the patch and remove the other side of the release liner. 10. press the patch down firmly with the palm of your hand. keep it pressed for about 30 seconds. this makes sure the patch is touching the skin and the edges stick down well. 11. wash your hands with soap and water straight after handling the patch. how to take off a used patch slowly and carefully peel off the used patch. gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap. this will remove any stickiness that stays on your skin. you can also use a little baby oil to remove any stickiness that will not wash off. do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids such as nail polish remover. these may irritate your skin. if you use more leganto than you should using higher doses of leganto than your doctor has prescribed may cause side effects such as feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting, low blood pressure, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), feeling confused, very sleepy, having involuntary movements and convulsions. in such cases, contact your doctor or hospital straight away. they will tell you what to do if you forget to change the patch at your usual time if you have forgotten to change the patch at your usual time, change it as soon as you remember. take off the old patch and use a new one. if you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as soon as you remember. in both cases, use a new patch at the usual time on the following day. do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop using leganto do not stop using leganto without talking to your doctor. a sudden stop could lead to a medical condition called 'neuroleptic malignant syndrome' which could be life-threatening. the signs include: loss of muscle movement (akinesia), rigid muscles, fever, unstable blood pressure, increased heart rate (tachycardia), confusion, low level of consciousness (such as a coma). if your doctor says you should stop leganto,the daily dose should be lowered gradually: restless legs syndrome lowered by 1 mg every other day. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "leganto", "Type":
