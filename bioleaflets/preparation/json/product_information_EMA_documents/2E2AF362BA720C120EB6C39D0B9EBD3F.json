CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMalignant pleural mesothelioma \n \nPemetrexed Hospira in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve \npatients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer \n \nPemetrexed Hospira in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell \nhistology (see section 5.1).  \n \nPemetrexed Hospira is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or \nmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients \nwhose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nPemetrexed Hospira is indicated as monotherapy for the second-line treatment of patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPemetrexed Hospira must only be administered under the supervision of a physician qualified in the \nuse of anti-cancer chemotherapy. \n \nPosology \n \nPemetrexed Hospira in combination with cisplatin \nThe recommended dose of Pemetrexed Hospira is 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered \nas an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. The recommended \ndose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion \nof the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle. Patients must receive adequate \nanti-emetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin (see also \ncisplatin Summary of Product Characteristics for specific dosing advice).  \n \nPemetrexed Hospira as single agent \nIn patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of \nPemetrexed Hospira is 500 mg/m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on \nthe first day of each 21-day cycle.  \n \nPre-medication regimen \nTo reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior \nto, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration. The corticosteroid should be equivalent \nto 4 mg of dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (see section 4.4).  \n \nTo reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must also receive vitamin supplementation (see \nsection 4.4). Patients must take oral folic acid or a multivitamin containing folic acid (350 to \n1,000 micrograms) on a daily basis. At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven \ndays preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of \ntherapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive an intramuscular \ninjection of vitamin B12 (1,000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and \nonce every three cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as \npemetrexed.  \n \nMonitoring \nPatients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, \nincluding a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy \nadministration, blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before \nthe start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: absolute neutrophil \ncount (ANC) should be ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3.  \n \nCreatinine clearance should be ≥ 45 ml/min.  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \nThe total bilirubin should be ≤ 1.5-times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST or SGOT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3-times \nupper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT ≤ 5-times upper limit of normal is \nacceptable if liver has tumour involvement.  \n \nDose adjustments \nDose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or \nmaximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed \nto allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery, patients should be re-treated using the guidelines \nin Tables 1, 2, and 3, which are applicable for Pemetrexed Hospira used as a single agent or in \ncombination with cisplatin.  \n \nTable 1. Dose modification table for Pemetrexed Hospira (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin - Haematologic toxicities\nNadir ANC < 500/mm3 and nadir platelets ≥ \n50,000/mm3 \n\n75% of previous dose (both Pemetrexed \nHospira and cisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000/mm3 regardless of nadir ANC  75% of previous dose (both Pemetrexed \nHospira and cisplatin) \n\nNadir platelets < 50,000/mm3 with bleedinga, \nregardless of nadir ANC  \n\n50% of previous dose (both Pemetrexed \nHospira and cisplatin) \n\na These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \ndefinition of ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding. \n \nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), Pemetrexed \nHospira should be withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient's pre-therapy value. \nTreatment should be resumed according to the guidelines in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2.

Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is \nobserved.  \n \nTable 3. Dose modification table for Pemetrexed Hospira (as single agent or in combination) and \n\ncisplatin - Neurotoxicity\nCTC a Grade Dose of Pemetrexed Hospira (mg/m2) Dose for cisplatin (mg/m2) \n0-1  100% of previous dose 100% of previous dose  \n2  100% of previous dose 50% of previous dose  \na National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) \n \nTreatment with Pemetrexed Hospira should be discontinued if a patient experiences any haematologic \nor non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 \nneurotoxicity is observed.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nIn clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased \nrisk of adverse reactions compared to patients younger than 65 years old. No dose reductions other \nthan those recommended for all patients are necessary.  \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of pemetrexed in the paediatric population in malignant pleural mesothelioma \nand non-small cell lung cancer.  \n \nPatients with renal impairment (Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or glomerular filtration rate \nmeasured Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method) \n  \nPemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients with \ncreatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for \nall patients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance \nbelow 45 ml/min; therefore, the use of pemetrexed is not recommended (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed \npharmacokinetics were identified. However, patients with hepatic impairment, such as bilirubin \n> 1.5-times the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransferase > 3.0-times the upper limit of normal \n(hepatic metastases absent) or > 5.0-times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present), have \nnot been specifically studied. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nPemetrexed Hospira is for intravenous use. Pemetrexed Hospira should be administered as an \nintravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle. \n \nFor precautions to be taken before handling or administering Pemetrexed Hospira and for instructions \non reconstitution and dilution of Pemetrexed Hospira before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6).  \n \nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and \nanaemia (or pancytopenia) (see section 4.8). Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. \nPatients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be \ngiven to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count \nreturns to ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, \nplatelet count, and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2).  \n \nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities, such as \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia, were reported when \npre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore, all patients treated with \npemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce \ntreatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment with \ndexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nAn insufficient number of patients have been studied with creatinine clearance of below 45 ml/min. \nTherefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance of <45 ml/min is not \nrecommended (see section 4.2).  \n \nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min) should \navoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic \nacid (>1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration \n(see section 4.5).  \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy, NSAIDs with \nlong elimination half-lives should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least \n2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5).  \n \nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in \nassociation with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had \nunderlying risk factors for the development of renal events, including dehydration or pre-existing \nhypertension or diabetes. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular necrosis were also reported \nin post marketing setting with pemetrexed alone or with other chemotherapeutic agents. Most of these \nevents resolved after pemetrexed withdrawal. Patients should be regularly monitored for acute tubular \nnecrosis, decreased renal function and signs and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \n(e.g. hypernatraemia).  \n \nThe effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully defined. \nA phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable third space fluid demonstrated \nno difference in pemetrexed dose normalised plasma concentrations or clearance compared to patients \nwithout third space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of third space fluid collection prior to pemetrexed \ntreatment should be considered, but may not be necessary.  \n \nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe \ndehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and \nappropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment.  \n \nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been \nuncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination \nwith another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had \npre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.8).  \n \nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated \nvaccines is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).  \n \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men \nare advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.  \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed \n(see section 4.6).  \n \nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, \nduring, or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these patients, \nand caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years \npreviously.  \n \nExcipients \n \nPemetrexed Hospira 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium- free’.  \n \nPemetrexed Hospira 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nThis medicinal product contains 54 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 2.7% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \nPemetrexed Hospira 1,000 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nThis medicinal product contains 108 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 5.4% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by \nglomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic medicinal products (e.g., \naminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, ciclosporin) could potentially result in delayed \nclearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine \nclearance should be closely monitored.  \n \nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid, penicillin) \ncould potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made when these \nmedicinal products are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely \nmonitored.  \n \nIn patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min), high doses of non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid at \nhigher doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the \noccurrence of pemetrexed adverse reactions. Therefore, caution should be made when administering \nhigher doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal \nfunction (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml/min).  \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/min), the \nconcomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid at \nhigher doses should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed \nadministration (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives such as \npiroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed in patients with mild to \nmoderate renal insufficiency should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at \nleast 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4). If concomitant administration of \nNSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression \nand gastrointestinal toxicity.  \n \nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition \nof the metabolic clearance of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and \nCYP1A2.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nInteractions common to all cytotoxics \n \nDue to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is \nfrequent. The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the \npossibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anti-cancer chemotherapy require increased \nfrequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with \noral anticoagulants.  \n \nConcomitant use contraindicated: Yellow fever vaccine: risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see \nsection 4.3).  \n \nConcomitant use not recommended: Live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, for which \nconcomitant use is contraindicated): risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in \nsubjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine \nwhere it exists (poliomyelitis) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. \nPemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a \nchild during the treatment, and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are \nrecommended.  \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women; but pemetrexed, like other anti-\nmetabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Animal \nstudies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pemetrexed should not be used during \npregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the \nrisk for the foetus (see section 4.4).  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk, and adverse reactions on the \nbreast-feeding child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed \ntherapy (see section 4.3).  \n \nFertility \n \nOwing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to \nseek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, it \nhas been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore, patients should be cautioned against \ndriving or operating machines if this event occurs. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most commonly reported undesirable effects related to pemetrexed, whether used as monotherapy \nor in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, neutropenia, leucopenia, \nthrombocytopenia; and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nconstipation, pharyngitis, mucositis, and stomatitis. Other undesirable effects include renal toxicities, \nincreased aminotransferases, alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy.  \nRarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n  \nThe table 4 lists the adverse drug events regardless of causality associated with pemetrexed used either \nas a monotherapy treatment or in combination with cisplatin from the pivotal registration studies \n(JMCH, JMEI, JMBD, JMEN and PARAMOUNT) and from the post marketing period. \n \nADRs are listed by MedDRA body system organ class. The following convention has been used for \nclassification of frequency: very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: < 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nTable 4.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nReported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, sensory \npolyneuropathy, and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as \nmanifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without \nfever, diarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen. In the event of suspected overdose, patients should be \nmonitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary. The use of calcium \nfolinate/folinic acid in the management of pemetrexed overdose should be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, folic acid analogues. ATC code: L01BA04.  \n \nPemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial \nfolate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.  \n \nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multi-targeted antifolate by inhibiting \nthymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide \nformyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of \nthymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate \ncarrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly \nand efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The \npolyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. \nPolyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a \nlesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life \nresulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing pemetrexed in all subsets of the paediatric population for the \ngranted indications (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nMesothelioma \nEMPHACIS, a multi-centre, randomised, single-blind Phase 3 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin \nversus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\ntreated with pemetrexed and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival \nadvantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone.  \n \nDuring the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to patients' \ntherapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all \npatients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug (randomised and treated). A \nsubgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation \nduring the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented). The results of these analyses of \nefficacy are summarised in the table below.  \n \nTable 5.

The separation \nbetween the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the pemetrexed \n/cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.  \n \nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pemetrexed alone. \nPemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single agent in 64 chemonaive patients with \nmalignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1%.  \n \nNSCLC, second-line treatment \nA multi-centre, randomised, open-label Phase-3 study of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of \n8.3 months for patients treated with pemetrexed (Intent-To-Treat [ITT] population N = 283) and \n7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT N = 288). Prior chemotherapy did not include \npemetrexed. An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival \nwas in favour of pemetrexed versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies \n(N = 399, 9.3 versus 8.0 months, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047) \nand was in favour of docetaxel for squamous cell carcinoma histology (N =172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nadjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018). There were no clinically relevant differences \nobserved for the safety profile of pemetrexed within the histology subgroups.  \n \nLimited clinical data from a separate randomised, Phase-3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data \n(overall survival, progression-free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously \npre-treated with docetaxel (N = 41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment \n(N = 540).  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \nTable 6.

All \npatients included in this study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1.  \n \nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy \nendpoints were also assessed on the Protocol Qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy analyses using \nPQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority \nof AC versus GC.  \n \nProgression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: \nmedian PFS was 4.8 months for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus \ncisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.04; 95% CI= 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was 30.6% \n(95% CI= 27.3- 33.9) for pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI= 25.0-31.4) for \ngemcitabine plus cisplatin. PFS data were partially confirmed by an independent review \n(400/1725 patients were randomly selected for review).  \n \nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically relevant \ndifferences in survival according to histology, see table below.  \n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nTable 7.

First-line doublet therapy containing pemetrexed was not included. All \npatients included in this study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance \n\nPC \nGC \n\nPC \nGC \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\ntreatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation \nafter completion of first-line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of \nmaintenance treatment with pemetrexed and 3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) \ncompleted ≥ 6 cycles and a total of 103 patients (23.4%) completed ≥ 10 cycles of treatment with \npemetrexed.  \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (N = 581, independently reviewed population; median of \n4.0 months and 2.0 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, p < 0.00001). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. The \nmedian OS for the overall population (N = 663) was 13.4 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n10.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.79 (95% CI= 0.65-0.95, p = 0.01192).  \n \nConsistent with other pemetrexed studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was \nobserved in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n(N = 430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the pemetrexed arm \nand 1.8 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.37-0.60, p = 0.00001). The \nmedian OS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (N = 481) was \n15.5 months for the pemetrexed arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.70 (95% \nCI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002). Including the induction phase, the median OS for patients with NSCLC \nother than predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n13.6 months for the placebo arm, hazard ratio = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002).  \n \nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for \npemetrexed over placebo.  \n \nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of pemetrexed within the \nhistology subgroups.  \n \nJMEN: Kaplan-Meier plots of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival pemetrexed \nversus placebo in patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology \n \n\n \n \nPARAMOUNT \nA multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase-3 study (PARAMOUNT), \ncompared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed plus BSC \n(N = 359) with that of placebo plus BSC (N = 180) in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or \nmetastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology who did not progress \nafter 4 cycles of first-line doublet therapy of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin. Of the \n939 patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomised to \nmaintenance treatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of the randomised patients, 44.9% had a \ncomplete/partial response and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to pemetrexed plus cisplatin \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\ninduction. Patients randomised to maintenance treatment were required to have an ECOG performance \nstatus 0 or 1. The median time from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction therapy to the start \nof maintenance treatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. \nRandomised patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety \nwere measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first-line (induction) therapy. \nPatients received a median of 4 cycles of maintenance treatment with pemetrexed and 4 cycles of \nplacebo. A total of 169 patients (47.1%) completed ≥ 6 cycles maintenance treatment with pemetrexed, \nrepresenting at least 10 total cycles of pemetrexed.  \n \nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the \npemetrexed arm over the placebo arm (N = 472, independently reviewed population; median of \n3.9 months and 2.6 months, respectively) (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.51-0.81, p = 0.0002). The \nindependent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. For \nrandomised patients, as measured from the start of pemetrexed plus cisplatin first-line induction \ntreatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the pemetrexed arm and \n5.6 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.47-0.74).  \n \nFollowing pemetrexed plus cisplatin induction (4 cycles), treatment with pemetrexed was statistically \nsuperior to placebo for OS (median 13.9 months versus 11.0 months, hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% \nCI=0.64-0.96, p=0.0195). At the time of this final survival analysis, 28.7% of patients were alive or \nlost to follow up on the pemetrexed arm versus 21.7% on the placebo arm. The relative treatment \neffect of pemetrexed was internally consistent across subgroups (including disease stage, induction \nresponse, ECOG PS, smoking status, gender, histology and age) and similar to that observed in the \nunadjusted OS and PFS analyses. The 1 year and 2 year survival rates for patients on pemetrexed were \n58% and 32% respectively, compared to 45% and 21% for patients on placebo. From the start of \npemetrexed plus cisplatin first-line induction treatment, the median OS of patients was 16.9 months for \nthe pemetrexed arm and 14.0 months for the placebo arm (hazard ratio= 0.78, 95% CI= 0.64-0.96). \nThe percentage of patients that received post-study treatment was 64.3% for pemetrexed and 71.7% \nfor placebo.  \n \nPARAMOUNT: Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival (PFS) and Overall Survival \n(OS) for continuation pemetrexed maintenance versus placebo in patients with NSCLC other \nthan predominantly squamous cell histology (measured from randomisation) \n \n\n \n \nThe pemetrexed maintenance safety profiles from the two studies JMEN and PARAMOUNT were \nsimilar. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been \nevaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2 to \n838 mg/m2 infused over a 10 minute period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of \n9 l/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81% bound to plasma proteins. \nBinding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes \nlimited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the \nadministered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hours following \nadministration. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is actively secreted by OAT3 (organic anion \ntransporter).  \n \nPemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 ml/min and the elimination half-life from plasma is \n3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 ml/min). Between-patient \nvariability in clearance is moderate at 19.3%. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and \nmaximum plasma concentration increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics of \npemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles.  \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered \ncisplatin. Oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation do not affect the \npharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal \nweight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures, and cleft palate. \n \nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by reduced \nfertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by intravenous bolus injection \nfor 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium) have been \nobserved. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. Female fertility was not \ninvestigated.  \n \nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster \novary cells, or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus \ntest in the mouse.  \n \nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol (E421) \nHydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment)  \nSodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nPemetrexed is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer's \ninjection and Ringer's injection. In the absence of other compatibility studies this medicinal product \nmust not be mixed with other medicinal products. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vial \n3 years \n \nReconstituted and infusion solutions  \nChemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of Pemetrexed Hospira \npowder for concentrate for solution for infusion has been demonstrated for up to 24 hours after \nreconstitution of the original vial when stored below 25°C.  \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and \nwould normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nPemetrexed Hospira 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nType I glass vial with rubber stopper containing 100 mg of pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium \nhemipentahydrate). \nPack of 1 vial. \n \nPemetrexed Hospira 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nType I glass vial with rubber stopper containing 500 mg of pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium \nhemipentahydrate). \nPack of 1 vial. \n \nPemetrexed Hospira 1,000 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \nType I glass vial with rubber stopper containing 1,000 mg of pemetrexed (as pemetrexed disodium \nhemipentahydrate). \nPack of 1 vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for intravenous \n\ninfusion administration.  \n \n2. Calculate the dose and the number of Pemetrexed Hospira vials needed. Each vial contains an \n\nexcess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount.  \n \n3. Reconstitute 100 mg vials with 4.2 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, \n\nwithout preservative. Reconstitute 500 mg vials with 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) \nsolution for injection, without preservative. Reconstitute 1,000 mg vials with 40 ml of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, without preservative. The resulting solution contains \n25 mg/ml pemetrexed. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting \nsolution is clear and ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely \naffecting product quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further \ndilution is required.  \n\n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml with \n\nsodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection, without preservative, and administered as an \nintravenous infusion over 10 minutes.  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl chloride- \n\nand polyolefin-lined administration sets and infusion bags.  \n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \n\nprior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer.  \n \n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material must \nbe disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \n \nPreparation and administration precautions  \n \nAs with other potentially toxic anti-cancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed \nsolution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If \npemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not \na vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. \nExtravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants. \n \n \n7.

Use aseptic techniques during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for intravenous \n\ninfusion administration.  \n \n2. Calculate the dose and the number of Pemetrexed Hospira vials needed. Each vial contains an \n\nexcess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount.  \n \n3. Reconstitute each 100 mg vial with 4.2 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection, \n\nwithout preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n \n\nReconstitute each 500 mg vial with 20 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection, \nwithout preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n\n \nReconstitute each 1,000 mg vial with 40 ml of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for \ninjection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing 25 mg/ml pemetrexed. \n\n \nGently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and \nranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product \nquality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. Further dilution is required.  \n\n \n4. The appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution must be further diluted to 100 ml with \n\n9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection, without preservative, and administered as an \nintravenous infusion over 10 minutes.  \n\n \n5. Pemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed above are compatible with polyvinyl chloride- \n\nand polyolefin- lined administration sets and infusion bags. Pemetrexed is incompatible \nwith diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer’s Injection and Ringer’s Injection. \n\n \n6. Parenteral medicinal products must be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \n\nprior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer.  \n \n7. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material must \n\nbe disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \n \nPreparation and administration precautions \n \nAs with other potentially toxic anti-cancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and \npreparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed \nsolution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If \npemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not \na vesicant. There is not a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few \nreported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. \nExtravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants. \n \n\n\n\tSummary Of Product Characteristics\n\tA.
