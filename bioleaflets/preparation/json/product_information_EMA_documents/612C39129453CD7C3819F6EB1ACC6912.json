PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nVipidia 6.25 mg film-coated tablets \nLight pink, oval (approximately 9.1 mm long by 5.1 mm wide), biconvex, film-coated tablets with \n“TAK” and “ALG-6.25” printed in grey ink on one side. \n \nVipidia 12.5 mg film-coated tablets \nYellow, oval (approximately 9.1 mm long by 5.1 mm wide), biconvex, film-coated tablets with \n“TAK” and “ALG-12.5” printed in grey ink on one side. \n \nVipidia 25 mg film-coated tablets \nLight red, oval (approximately 9.1 mm long by 5.1 mm wide), biconvex, film-coated tablets with \n“TAK” and “ALG-25” printed in grey ink on one side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVipidia is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve \nglycaemic control in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal products including insulin, \nwhen these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFor the different dose regimens, Vipidia is available in strengths of 25 mg, 12.5 mg and 6.25 mg \nfilm-coated tablets. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nAdults (≥ 18 years old) \nThe recommended dose of alogliptin is one tablet of 25 mg once daily as add-on therapy to metformin, \na thiazolidinedione, a sulphonylurea, or insulin or as triple therapy with metformin and a \nthiazolidinedione or insulin. \n \nWhen alogliptin is used in combination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, the dose of \nmetformin and/or the thiazolidinedione should be maintained, and Vipidia administered \nconcomitantly. \n \nWhen alogliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, a lower dose of the \nsulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n \nCaution should be exercised when alogliptin is used in combination with metformin and a \nthiazolidinedione as an increased risk of hypoglycaemia has been observed with this triple therapy (see \nsection 4.4). In case of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of the thiazolidinedione or metformin may be \nconsidered. \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly (≥ 65 years old) \nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on age. However, dosing of alogliptin should be conservative \nin patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. \n \nRenal impairment \nFor patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 to ≤ 80 mL/min), no dose \nadjustment of alogliptin is necessary (see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥ 30 to ≤ 50 mL/min), one-half of the \nrecommended dose of alogliptin should be administered (12.5 mg once daily; see section 5.2). \n \nFor patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease requiring \ndialysis, one-quarter of the recommended dose of alogliptin should be administered (6.25 mg once \ndaily). Alogliptin may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis. Experience in patients \nrequiring renal dialysis is limited. Alogliptin has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal \ndialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nAppropriate assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of treatment and \nperiodically thereafter (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nscores of 5 to 9). Alogliptin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh score > 9) and is, therefore, not recommended for use in such patients (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Vipidia in children and adolescents < 18 years old have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nVipidia should be taken once daily with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with \nwater. \n \nIf a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose should not be \ntaken on the same day. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or history of a \nserious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and \nangioedema, to any dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \n \nVipidia should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis. Vipidia is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients. \n \nUse with other antihyperglycaemic medicinal products and hypoglycaemia \n \nDue to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia in combination with a sulphonylurea, insulin or \ncombination therapy with thiazolidinedione plus metformin, a lower dose of these medicinal products \nmay be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when these medicinal products are used in \ncombination with alogliptin (see section 4.2). \n \nCombinations not studied \n \nAlogliptin has not been studied in combination with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) \ninhibitors or glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues nor formally as triple therapy with metformin \nand a sulphonylurea. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAs there is a need for dose adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or \nend-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, appropriate assessment of renal function is recommended \nprior to initiation of alogliptin therapy and periodically thereafter (see section 4.2).  \n \nExperience in patients requiring renal dialysis is limited. Alogliptin has not been studied in patients \nundergoing peritoneal dialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nAlogliptin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 9) and \nis, therefore, not recommended for use in such patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n \nCardiac failure \n \nExperience of alogliptin use in clinical studies in patients with congestive heart failure of New York \nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III and IV is limited and caution is warranted in these \npatients. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema and exfoliative skin \nconditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have been observed for \nDPP-4 inhibitors and have been spontaneously reported for alogliptin in the post-marketing setting. In \nclinical studies of alogliptin, anaphylactic reactions were reported with a low incidence.  \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nAcute pancreatitis \n \nUse of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In a pooled \nanalysis of the data from 13 studies, the overall rates of pancreatitis reports in patients treated with \n25 mg alogliptin, 12.5 mg alogliptin, active control or placebo were 2, 1, 1 or 0 events per \n1,000 patient years, respectively. In the cardiovascular outcomes study the rates of pancreatitis reports \nin patients treated with alogliptin or placebo were 3 or 2 events per 1,000 patient years, respectively. \nThere have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis in the post-marketing \nsetting. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, \nsevere abdominal pain, which may radiate to the back. If pancreatitis is suspected, Vipidia should be \ndiscontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Vipidia should not be restarted. Caution should be \nexercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. \n \nHepatic effects \n \nPostmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure have been received. A causal \nrelationship has not been established. Patients should be observed closely for possible liver \nabnormalities. Obtain liver function tests promptly in patients with symptoms suggestive of liver \ninjury. If an abnormality is found and an alternative etiology is not established, consider \ndiscontinuation of alogliptin treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on alogliptin \n \nAlogliptin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and metabolism by the cytochrome (CYP) \nP450 enzyme system is negligible (see section 5.2). Interactions with CYP inhibitors are thus not \nexpected and have not been shown. \n \nResults from clinical interaction studies also demonstrate that there are no clinically relevant effects of \ngemfibrozil (a CYP2C8/9 inhibitor), fluconazole (a CYP2C9 inhibitor), ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 \ninhibitor), cyclosporine (a p-glycoprotein inhibitor), voglibose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), \ndigoxin, metformin, cimetidine, pioglitazone or atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. \n \nEffects of alogliptin on other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro studies suggest that alogliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP 450 isoforms at concentrations \nachieved with the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin (see section 5.2). Interaction with substrates \nof CYP 450 isoforms are thus not expected and have not been shown. In studies in vitro, alogliptin \nwas found to be neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of key transporters associated with disposition of \nthe active substance in the kidney: organic anion transporter-1, organic anion transporter-3 or organic \ncationic transporter-2 (OCT2). Furthermore, clinical data do not suggest interaction with \np-glycoprotein inhibitors or substrates.  \n \nIn clinical studies, alogliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, \n(R)-warfarin, pioglitazone, glyburide, tolbutamide, (S)-warfarin, dextromethorphan, atorvastatin, \nmidazolam, an oral contraceptive (norethindrone and ethinyl oestradiol), digoxin, fexofenadine, \nmetformin, or cimetidine, thus providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity to cause interaction with \nsubstrates of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, p-glycoprotein, and OCT2. \n \nIn healthy subjects, alogliptin had no effect on prothrombin time or International Normalised Ratio \n(INR) when administered concomitantly with warfarin. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nCombination with other anti-diabetic medicinal products \n \nResults from studies with metformin, pioglitazone (thiazolidinedione), voglibose (alpha-glucosidase \ninhibitor) and glyburide (sulphonylurea) have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic \ninteractions. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of alogliptin in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct \nor indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary \nmeasure, it is preferable to avoid the use of alogliptin during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether alogliptin is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of \nalogliptin in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue alogliptin therapy should be \nmade taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of alogliptin \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThe effect of alogliptin on fertility in humans has not been studied. No adverse effects on fertility were \nobserved in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVipidia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However patients \nshould be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia especially when combined with a sulphonylurea, \ninsulin or combination therapy with thiazolidinedione plus metformin. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe information provided is based on a total of 9,405 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including \n3,750 patients treated with 25 mg alogliptin and 2,476 patients treated with 12.5 mg alogliptin, who \nparticipated in one phase 2 or 12 phase 3 double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical studies. \nIn addition, a cardiovascular outcomes study with 5,380 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a \nrecent acute coronary syndrome event was conducted with 2,701 randomised to alogliptin and \n2,679 randomised to placebo. These studies evaluated the effects of alogliptin on glycaemic control \nand its safety as monotherapy, as initial combination therapy with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, \nand as add-on therapy to metformin, or a sulphonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione (with or without \nmetformin or a sulphonylurea), or insulin (with or without metformin). \n \nIn a pooled analysis of the data from 13 studies, the overall incidences of adverse events, serious \nadverse events and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of therapy were comparable in patients \ntreated with 25 mg alogliptin, 12.5 mg alogliptin, active control or placebo. The most common adverse \nreaction in patients treated with 25 mg alogliptin was headache. \n \nThe safety of alogliptin between the elderly (≥ 65 years old) and non-elderly (< 65 years old) was \nsimilar. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very \ncommon (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \nIn the pooled pivotal phase 3 controlled clinical studies of alogliptin as monotherapy and as add-on \ncombination therapy involving 5,659 patients, the observed adverse reactions are listed below \n(Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n \nSystem organ class Frequency of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reaction  \nInfections and infestations  \nupper respiratory tract infections common \nnasopharyngitis common \nImmune system disorders  \nhypersensitivity not known \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders  \nhypoglycaemia common \nNervous system disorders  \nheadache common \nGastrointestinal disorders  \nabdominal pain common \ngastroesophageal reflux disease common \ndiarrhoea common \nacute pancreatitis not known \nHepatobiliary disorders  \nhepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure not known \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders   \npruritus common \nrash common \nexfoliative skin conditions including \nStevens-Johnson syndrome \nerythema multiforme \n\n \nnot known \nnot known \n\nangioedema not known \nurticaria not known \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest doses of alogliptin administered in clinical studies were single doses of 800 mg to healthy \nsubjects and doses of 400 mg once daily for 14 days to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(equivalent to 32 times and 16 times the recommended daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin, respectively).  \n \nManagement \n \nIn the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive measures should be employed as dictated by the \npatient’s clinical status.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nMinimal quantities of alogliptin are removed by haemodialysis (approximately 7% of the substance \nwas removed during a 3-hour haemodialysis session). Therefore, haemodialysis is of little clinical \nbenefit in overdose. It is not known if alogliptin is removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes; dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. \n \nATC code: A10BH04. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nAlogliptin is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of DPP-4, >10,000-fold more selective for DPP-4 \nthan other related enzymes including DPP-8 and DPP-9. DPP-4 is the principal enzyme involved in \nthe rapid degradation of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP \n(glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), which are released by the intestine and levels are \nincreased in response to a meal. GLP-1 and GIP increases insulin biosynthesis and secretion from \npancreatic beta cells, while GLP-1 also inhibits glucagon secretion and hepatic glucose production. \nAlogliptin therefore improves glycaemic control via a glucose-dependent mechanism, whereby insulin \nrelease is enhanced and glucagon levels are suppressed when glucose levels are high.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nAlogliptin has been studied as monotherapy, as initial combination therapy with metformin or a \nthiazolidinedione, and as add-on therapy to metformin, or a sulphonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione \n(with or without metformin or a sulphonylurea), or insulin (with or without metformin).  \n \nAdministration of 25 mg alogliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus produced peak inhibition \nof DPP-4 within 1 to 2 hours and exceeded 93% both after a single 25 mg dose and after 14 days of \nonce-daily dosing. Inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 81% at 24 hours after 14 days of dosing. \nWhen the 4-hour postprandial glucose concentrations were averaged across breakfast, lunch and \ndinner, 14 days of treatment with 25 mg alogliptin resulted in a mean placebo-corrected reduction \nfrom baseline of -35.2 mg/dL. \n \nBoth 25 mg alogliptin alone and in combination with 30 mg pioglitazone demonstrated significant \ndecreases in postprandial glucose and postprandial glucagon whilst significantly increasing \npostprandial active GLP-1 levels at Week 16 compared to placebo (p<0.05). In addition, 25 mg \nalogliptin alone and in combination with 30 mg pioglitazone produced statistically significant \n(p<0.001) reductions in total triglycerides at Week 16 as measured by postprandial incremental \nAUC(0-8) change from baseline compared to placebo. \n \nA total of 14,779 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 6,448 patients treated with 25 mg \nalogliptin and 2,476 patients treated with 12.5 mg alogliptin, participated in one phase 2 or 13 phase 3 \n(including the cardiovascular outcomes study) double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical \nstudies conducted to evaluate the effects of alogliptin on glycaemic control and its safety. In these \nstudies, 2,257 alogliptin-treated patients were ≥ 65 years old and 386 alogliptin-treated patients were \n≥ 75 years old. The studies included 5,744 patients with mild renal impairment, 1,290 patients with \nmoderate renal impairment and 82 patients with severe renal impairment / end-stage renal disease \ntreated with alogliptin.  \n \nOverall, treatment with the recommended daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin improved glycaemic control \nwhen given as monotherapy and as initial or add-on combination therapy. This was determined by \nclinically relevant and statistically significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and \nfasting plasma glucose compared to control from baseline to study endpoint. Reductions in HbA1c \n\n\n\n9 \n\nwere similar across different subgroups including renal impairment, age, gender and body mass index, \nwhile differences between races (e.g. White and non-White) were small. Clinically meaningful \nreductions in HbA1c compared to control were also observed with 25 mg alogliptin regardless of \nbaseline background treatment. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in \nHbA1c. Generally, the effects of alogliptin on body weight and lipids were neutral. \n \nAlogliptin as monotherapy \nTreatment with 25 mg alogliptin once daily resulted in statistically significant improvements from \nbaseline in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose compared to placebo-control at Week 26 (Table 2). \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to metformin \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean \ndose = 1,847 mg) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c and \nfasting plasma glucose at Week 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2). Significantly \nmore patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin (44.4%) achieved target HbA1c levels of ≤ 7.0% compared to \nthose receiving placebo (18.3%) at Week 26 (p<0.001).  \n \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean \ndose = 1,835 mg) resulted in improvements from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 and Week 104. At \nWeek 52, the HbA1c reduction by 25 mg alogliptin plus metformin (-0.76%, Table 3) was similar to \nthat produced by glipizide (mean dose = 5.2 mg) plus metformin hydrochloride therapy (mean \ndose = 1,824 mg, -0.73%). At Week 104, the HbA1c reduction by 25 mg alogliptin plus metformin \n(-0.72%, Table 3) was greater than that produced by glipizide plus metformin (-0.59%). Mean change \nfrom baseline in fasting plasma glucose at Week 52 for 25 mg alogliptin and metformin was \nsignificantly greater than that for glipizide and metformin (p<0.001). By Week 104, mean change \nfrom baseline in fasting plasma glucose for 25 mg alogliptin and metformin was -3.2 mg/dL compared \nwith 5.4 mg/dL for glipizide and metformin. More patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin and metformin \n(48.5%) achieved target HbA1c levels of ≤ 7.0% compared to those receiving glipizide and metformin \n(42.8%) (p=0.004). \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to a sulphonylurea \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to glyburide therapy (mean dose = 12.2 mg) resulted in \nstatistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26 when compared to the \naddition of placebo (Table 2). Mean change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose at Week 26 for \n25 mg alogliptin showed a reduction of 8.4 mg/dL compared to an increase of 2.2 mg/dL with placebo. \nSignificantly more patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin (34.8%) achieved target HbA1c levels of \n≤ 7.0% compared to those receiving placebo (18.2%) at Week 26 (p=0.002).  \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedione \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to pioglitazone therapy (mean dose = 35.0 mg, with or \nwithout metformin or a sulphonylurea) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline \nin HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose at Week 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2). \nClinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo were also observed with 25 mg \nalogliptin regardless of whether patients were receiving concomitant metformin or sulphonylurea \ntherapy. Significantly more patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin (49.2%) achieved target HbA1c levels \nof ≤ 7.0% compared to those receiving placebo (34.0%) at Week 26 (p=0.004).  \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedione with metformin \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to 30 mg pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride \ntherapy (mean dose = 1,867.9 mg) resulted in improvements from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 that \nwere both non-inferior and statistically superior to those produced by 45 mg pioglitazone and \nmetformin hydrochloride therapy (mean dose = 1,847.6 mg, Table 3). The significant reductions in \nHbA1c observed with 25 mg alogliptin plus 30 mg pioglitazone and metformin were consistent over \nthe entire 52-week treatment period compared to 45 mg pioglitazone and metformin (p<0.001 at all \ntime points). In addition, mean change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose at Week 52 for 25 mg \nalogliptin plus 30 mg pioglitazone and metformin was significantly greater than that for 45 mg \npioglitazone and metformin (p<0.001). Significantly more patients receiving 25 mg alogliptin plus \n\n\n\n10 \n\n30 mg pioglitazone and metformin (33.2%) achieved target HbA1c levels of ≤ 7.0% compared to those \nreceiving 45 mg pioglitazone and metformin (21.3%) at Week 52 (p<0.001).  \n \nAlogliptin as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin) \nThe addition of 25 mg alogliptin once daily to insulin therapy (mean dose = 56.5 IU, with or without \nmetformin) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c and fasting \nplasma glucose at Week 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2). Clinically meaningful \nreductions in HbA1c compared to placebo were also observed with 25 mg alogliptin regardless of \nwhether patients were receiving concomitant metformin therapy. More patients receiving 25 mg \nalogliptin (7.8%) achieved target HbA1c levels of ≤ 7.0% compared to those receiving placebo (0.8%) \nat Week 26.  \n \n\nTable 2: Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline with alogliptin 25 mg at Week 26  \nby placebo-controlled study (FAS, LOCF) \n\nStudy Mean baseline \nHbA1c (%) (SD) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c \n\n(%)† (SE) \n\nPlacebo-corrected \nchange from baseline \n\nin HbA1c (%)† \n(2-sided 95% CI) \n\nMonotherapy placebo-controlled study \nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily \n(n=128) \n\n7.91 \n(0.788) \n\n-0.59 \n(0.066) \n\n-0.57* \n(-0.80, -0.35) \n\nAdd-on combination therapy placebo-controlled studies \nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with \nmetformin \n(n=203) \n\n7.93 \n(0.799) \n\n-0.59 \n(0.054) \n\n-0.48* \n(-0.67, -0.30) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with a \nsulphonylurea \n(n=197) \n\n8.09 \n(0.898) \n\n-0.52 \n(0.058) \n\n-0.53* \n(-0.73, -0.33) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with a \nthiazolidinedione ± \nmetformin or a \nsulphonylurea \n(n=195) \n\n8.01 \n(0.837) \n\n-0.80 \n(0.056) \n\n-0.61* \n(-0.80, -0.41) \n\nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with \ninsulin + metformin \n(n=126) \n\n9.27 \n(1.127) \n\n-0.71 \n(0.078) \n\n-0.59* \n(-0.80, -0.37) \n\nFAS = full analysis set \nLOCF = last observation carried forward \n† Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycaemic therapy status and baseline values \n* p<0.001 compared to placebo or placebo+combination treatment \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 3: Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline with alogliptin 25 mg \nby active-controlled study (PPS, LOCF) \n\nStudy Mean baseline \nHbA1c (%) (SD) \n\nMean change from \nbaseline in HbA1c \n\n(%)† (SE) \n\nTreatment-corrected \nchange from baseline \n\nin HbA1c (%)† \n(1-sided CI) \n\nAdd-on combination therapy studies \nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with \nmetformin vs a \nsulphonylurea + \nmetformin \n \nChange at Week 52 \n(n=382) \n \nChange at \nWeek 104 (n=382) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7.61 \n(0.526) \n\n \n7.61 \n\n(0.526) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.76 \n(0.027) \n\n \n-0.72 \n\n(0.037) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.03 \n(-infinity, 0.059) \n\n \n-0.13* \n\n(-infinity, -0.006) \nAlogliptin 25 mg \nonce daily with a \nthiazolidinedione + \nmetformin vs a \ntitrating \nthiazolidinedione + \nmetformin \n \nChange at Week 26 \n(n=303) \n \nChange at Week 52 \n(n=303) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8.25 \n(0.820) \n\n \n8.25 \n\n(0.820) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.89 \n(0.042) \n\n \n-0.70 \n\n(0.048) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-0.47* \n(-infinity, -0.35) \n\n \n-0.42* \n\n(-infinity, -0.28) \n\nPPS = per protocol set \nLOCF = last observation carried forward \n* Non inferiority and superiority statistically demonstrated \n† Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycaemic therapy status and baseline values \n \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nThe efficacy and safety of the recommended doses of alogliptin were investigated separately in a \nsubgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease \nin a placebo-controlled study (59 patients on alogliptin and 56 patients on placebo for 6 months) and \nfound to be consistent with the profile obtained in patients with normal renal function. \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old) \nThe efficacy of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ≥ 65 years old across a pooled \nanalysis of five 26-week placebo-controlled studies was consistent with that in patients < 65 years old. \n \nIn addition, treatment with 25 mg alogliptin once daily resulted in improvements from baseline in \nHbA1c at Week 52 that were similar to those produced by glipizide (mean dose = 5.4 mg). \nImportantly, despite alogliptin and glipizide having similar HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose \nchanges from baseline, episodes of hypoglycaemia were notably less frequent in patients receiving \n25 mg alogliptin (5.4%) compared to those receiving glipizide (26.0%). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nClinical safety \n \nCardiovascular Safety \nIn a pooled analysis of the data from 13 studies, the overall incidences of cardiovascular death, non \nfatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke were comparable in patients treated with 25 mg \nalogliptin, active control or placebo. \n \nIn addition, a prospective randomised cardiovascular outcomes safety study was conducted with \n5,380 patients with high underlying cardiovascular risk to examine the effect of alogliptin compared \nwith placebo (when added to standard of care) on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) \nincluding time to the first occurrence of any event in the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal \nmyocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke in patients with a recent (15 to 90 days) acute coronary \nevent. At baseline, patients had a mean age of 61 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.2 years, and \nmean HbA1c of 8.0%. \n \nThe study demonstrated that alogliptin did not increase the risk of having a MACE compared to \nplacebo [Hazard Ratio: 0.96; 1-sided 99% Confidence Interval: 0-1.16]. In the alogliptin group, 11.3% \nof patients experienced a MACE compared to 11.8% of patients in the placebo group.  \n \n\nTable 4.

In the alogliptin group, 12.7% (344 subjects) experienced an \nevent within the secondary MACE composite endpoint, compared with 13.4% (359 subjects) in the \nplacebo group [Hazard Ratio = 0.95; 1-sided 99% Confidence Interval: 0-1.14]. \n \nHypoglycaemia \nIn a pooled analysis of the data from 12 studies, the overall incidence of any episode of \nhypoglycaemia was lower in patients treated with 25 mg alogliptin than in patients treated with \n12.5 mg alogliptin, active control or placebo (3.6%, 4.6%, 12.9% and 6.2%, respectively). The \nmajority of these episodes were mild to moderate in intensity. The overall incidence of episodes of \nsevere hypoglycaemia was comparable in patients treated with 25 mg alogliptin or 12.5 mg alogliptin, \nand lower than the incidence in patients treated with active control or placebo (0.1%, 0.1%, 0.4% and \n0.4%, respectively). In the prospective randomised controlled cardiovascular outcomes study, \ninvestigator reported events of hypoglycemia were similar in patients receiving placebo (6.5%) and \npatients receiving alogliptin (6.7%) in addition to standard of care. \n \nIn a clinical study of alogliptin as mono-therapy, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar to that of \nplacebo, and lower than placebo in another study as add-on to a sulphonylurea.  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nHigher rates of hypoglycaemia were observed with triple therapy with thiazolidinedione and \nmetformin and in combination with insulin, as observed with other DPP-4 inhibitors.  \n \nPatients (≥ 65 years old) with type 2 diabetes mellitus are considered more susceptible to episodes of \nhypoglycaemia than patients < 65 years old. In a pooled analysis of the data from 12 studies, the \noverall incidence of any episode of hypoglycaemia was similar in patients ≥ 65 years old treated with \n25 mg alogliptin (3.8%) to that in patients < 65 years old (3.6%). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVipidia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of alogliptin has been shown to be similar in healthy subjects and in patients \nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of alogliptin is approximately 100%.  \n \nAdministration with a high-fat meal resulted in no change in total and peak exposure to alogliptin. \nVipidia may, therefore, be administered with or without food.  \n \nAfter administration of single, oral doses of up to 800 mg in healthy subjects, alogliptin was rapidly \nabsorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1 to 2 hours (median Tmax) after dosing. \n \nNo clinically relevant accumulation after multiple dosing was observed in either healthy subjects or in \npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  \n \nTotal and peak exposure to alogliptin increased proportionately across single doses of 6.25 mg up to \n100 mg alogliptin (covering the therapeutic dose range). The inter-subject coefficient of variation for \nalogliptin AUC was small (17%).  \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing a single intravenous dose of 12.5 mg alogliptin to healthy subjects, the volume of \ndistribution during the terminal phase was 417 L indicating that the active substance is well distributed \ninto tissues.  \n \nAlogliptin is 20-30% bound to plasma proteins. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAlogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism, 60-70% of the dose is excreted as unchanged \nactive substance in the urine.  \n \nTwo minor metabolites were detected following administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, \nN-demethylated alogliptin, M-I (< 1% of the parent compound), and N-acetylated alogliptin, M-II \n(< 6% of the parent compound). M-I is an active metabolite and is a highly selective inhibitor of \nDPP-4 similar to alogliptin; M-II does not display any inhibitory activity towards DPP-4 or other \nDPP-related enzymes. In vitro data indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 contribute to the limited \nmetabolism of alogliptin.  \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn vitro studies indicate that alogliptin does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 and does not \ninhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at concentrations \nachieved with the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin. Studies in vitro have shown alogliptin to be \na mild inducer of CYP3A4, but alogliptin has not been shown to induce CYP3A4 in studies in vivo.  \n \nIn studies in vitro, alogliptin was not an inhibitor of the following renal transporters; OAT1, OAT3 \nand OCT2. \n \nAlogliptin exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (> 99%) and undergoes little or no chiral \nconversion in vivo to the (S)-enantiomer. The (S)-enantiomer is not detectable at therapeutic doses.  \n \nElimination \n \nAlogliptin was eliminated with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of approximately 21 hours.  \n \nFollowing administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, 76% of total radioactivity was eliminated \nin the urine and 13% was recovered in the faeces.  \n \nThe average renal clearance of alogliptin (170 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (approx. 120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion.  \n \nTime-dependency \n \nTotal exposure (AUC(0-inf)) to alogliptin following administration of a single dose was similar to \nexposure during one dose interval (AUC(0-24)) after 6 days of once daily dosing. This indicates no \ntime-dependency in the kinetics of alogliptin after multiple dosing. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nA single-dose of 50 mg alogliptin was administered to 4 groups of patients with varying degrees of \nrenal impairment (CrCl using the Cockcroft-Gault formula): mild (CrCl = > 50 to ≤ 80 mL/min), \nmoderate (CrCl = ≥ 30 to ≤ 50 mL/min), severe (CrCl = < 30 mL/min) and end-stage renal disease on \nhaemodialysis.  \n \nAn approximate 1.7-fold increase in AUC for alogliptin was observed in patients with mild renal \nimpairment. However, as the distribution of AUC values for alogliptin in these patients was within the \nsame range as control subjects, no dose adjustment for patients with mild renal impairment is \nnecessary (see section 4.2).  \n \nIn patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis, an \nincrease in systemic exposure to alogliptin of approximately 2- and 4-fold was observed, respectively. \n(Patients with end-stage renal disease underwent haemodialysis immediately after alogliptin dosing. \nBased on mean dialysate concentrations, approximately 7% of the active substance was removed \nduring a 3-hour haemodialysis session.) Therefore, in order to maintain systemic exposures to \nalogliptin that are similar to those observed in patients with normal renal function, lower doses of \nalogliptin should be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal \ndisease requiring dialysis (see section 4.2).  \n \nHepatic impairment \nTotal exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10% lower and peak exposure was approximately \n8% lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy control subjects. The \nmagnitude of these reductions was not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, no dose \nadjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores \nof 5 to 9). Alogliptin has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nscore > 9, see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nAge, gender, race, body weight \nAge (65-81 years old), gender, race (white, black and Asian) and body weight did not have any \nclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. No dose adjustment is necessary (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of alogliptin in children and adolescents < 18 years old has not been \nestablished. No data are available (see section 4.2).  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and toxicology. \n \nThe no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs \nup to 26 and 39 weeks in duration, respectively, produced exposure margins that were approximately \n147- and 227-fold, respectively, the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin. \n \nAlogliptin was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. \n \nAlogliptin was not carcinogenic in 2-year carcinogenicity studies conducted in rats and mice. Minimal \nto mild simple transitional cell hyperplasia was seen in the urinary bladder of male rats at the lowest \ndose used (27 times the human exposure) without establishment of a clear NOEL (no observed effect \nlevel). \n \nNo adverse effects of alogliptin were observed upon fertility, reproductive performance, or early \nembryonic development in rats up to a systemic exposure far above the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose. Although fertility was not affected, a slight, statistical increase in the number of \nabnormal sperm was observed in males at an exposure far above the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose.  \n \nPlacental transfer of alogliptin occurs in rats. \n \nAlogliptin was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits with a systemic exposure at the NOAELs far above the \nhuman exposure at the recommended dose. Higher doses of alogliptin were not teratogenic but \nresulted in maternal toxicity, and were associated with delayed and/or lack of ossification of bones and \ndecreased foetal body weights. \n \nIn a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, exposures far above the human exposure at the \nrecommended dose did not harm the developing embryo or affect offspring growth and development. \nHigher doses of alogliptin decreased offspring body weight and exerted some developmental effects \nconsidered secondary to the low body weight.  \n \nStudies in lactating rats indicate that alogliptin is excreted in milk. \n \nNo alogliptin-related effects were observed in juvenile rats following repeat-dose administration for \n4 and 8 weeks. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Vipidia \n3. How to take Vipidia \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Vipidia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vipidia is and what it is used for \n \nVipidia contains the active substance alogliptin which belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 \ninhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) which are “oral anti-diabetics”. It is used to lower blood \nsugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent \ndiabetes mellitus or NIDDM. \n \nVipidia works to increase the levels of insulin in the body after a meal and decrease the amount of \nsugar in the body. It must be taken together with other anti-diabetic medicines, which your doctor will \nhave prescribed for you, such as sulphonylureas (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide, glibenclamide), \nmetformin and/or thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone) and metformin and/or insulin.  \n \nVipidia is taken when your blood sugar cannot be adequately controlled by diet, exercise and one or \nmore of these other oral anti-diabetic medicines. It is important that you continue to take your other \nanti-diabetic medicine, and continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise that your nurse or doctor \nhas given you. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vipidia \n \nDo not take Vipidia: \n- if you are allergic to alogliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you have had a serious allergic reaction to any other similar medicines that you take to control \n\nyour blood sugar. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include; rash, raised red patches \non your skin (hives), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in \nbreathing or swallowing. Additional symptoms may include general itching and feeling of heat \nespecially affecting the scalp, mouth, throat, palms of hands and soles of feet (Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome). \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vipidia: \n- if you have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce insulin) \n- if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body is \n\nunable to breakdown glucose because there is not enough insulin). Symptoms include excessive \nthirst, frequent urination, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting and rapid weight loss \n\n- if you are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as sulphonylurea (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide, \nglibenclamide) or insulin. Your doctor may want to reduce your dose of sulphonylurea or \ninsulin when you take any of them together with Vipidia in order to avoid too low blood sugar \n(hypoglycaemia) \n\n- if you have kidney disease, you can still take this medicine but your doctor may reduce the dose \n- if you have liver disease \n- if you suffer from heart failure \n- if you are taking insulin or an anti-diabetic medicine, your doctor may want to reduce your dose \n\nof the other anti-diabetic medicine or insulin when you take either of them together with Vipidia \nin order to avoid low blood sugar \n\n- if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas \n \nChildren and adolescents  \nVipidia is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data in \nthese patients. \n \nOther medicines and Vipidia \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nThere is no experience of using Vipidia in pregnant women or during breast-feeding. Vipidia should \nnot be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Your doctor will help you to decide whether to \ncontinue breast-feeding or to continue using Vipidia. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVipidia is not known to affect your ability to drive and use machines. Taking Vipidia in combination \nwith other anti-diabetic medicines called sulphonylureas, insulin or combination therapy with \nthiazolidinedione plus metformin can cause too low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may \naffect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Vipidia \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe Vipidia together with one or more other medicines to control your blood \nsugar levels. Your doctor will tell you if you need to change the amount of other medicines you take. \n \nThe recommended dose of Vipidia is 25 mg once a day. \n \nPatients with kidney disease \nIf you have kidney disease your doctor may prescribe you a reduced dose. This may be 12.5 mg or \n6.25 mg once a day, depending on the severity of your kidney disease.  \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPatients with liver disease \nIf you have mildly or moderately reduced liver function, the recommended dose of Vipidia is 25 mg \nonce a day. This medicine is not recommended for patients with severely reduced liver function due to \nthe lack of data in these patients. \n \nSwallow your tablet(s) whole with water. You can take this medicine with or without food. \n \nIf you take more Vipidia than you should \nIf you take more tablets than you should, or if someone else or a child takes your medicine, contact or \ngo to your nearest emergency centre straight away. Take this leaflet or some tablets with you so that \nyour doctor knows exactly what you have taken.  \n \nIf you forget to take Vipidia \nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it. Do not take a double dose to make up \nfor a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Vipidia \nDo not stop taking Vipidia without consulting your doctor first. Your blood sugar levels may increase \nwhen you stop taking Vipidia. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nSTOP taking Vipidia and contact a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following serious \nside effects: \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): \n- An allergic reaction. The symptoms may include: a rash, hives, swallowing or breathing \n\nproblems, swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue and feeling faint.  \n- A severe allergic reaction: skin lesions or spots on your skin that can progress to a sore \n\nsurrounded by pale or red rings, blistering and/or peeling of the skin possibly with symptoms \nsuch as itching, fever, overall ill feeling, achy joints, vision problems, burning, painful or itchy \neyes and mouth sores (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Erythema multiforme). \n\n- Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your \nback, as well as nausea and vomiting, as it could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas \n(pancreatitis). \n\n \nYou should also discuss with your doctor if you experience the following side effects: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- Symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur when Vipidia is taken in \n\ncombination with insulin or sulphonylureas (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide, glibenclamide). \nSymptoms may include: trembling, sweating, anxiety, blurred vision, tingling lips, paleness, \nmood change or feeling confused.
