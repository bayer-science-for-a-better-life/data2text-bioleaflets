NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 5 mg film-coated tablets \nPrasugrel Mylan 10 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 5 mg: \nEach tablet contains prasugrel besilate equivalent to 5 mg prasugrel. \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 10 mg: \nEach tablet contains prasugrel besilate equivalent to 10 mg prasugrel. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach tablet contains 0.016 mg of sunset yellow FCF aluminium lake (E110). \n \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet). \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 5 mg: \nYellow film-coated, capsule shaped, biconvex tablet, of dimensions 8.15 mm × 4.15 mm, debossed \nwith ‘PH3’ on one side and ‘M’ on the other side. \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 10 mg: \nBeige film-coated, capsule shaped, biconvex tablet, of dimensions 11.15 mm × 5.15 mm, debossed \nwith ‘PH4’ on one side and ‘M’ on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nPrasugrel Mylan, co administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of \natherothrombotic events in adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (i.e. unstable angina, non-ST \nsegment elevation myocardial infarction [UA/NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial \ninfarction [STEMI]) undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). \n \nFor further information please refer to section 5.1. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nPrasugrel Mylan should be initiated with a single 60 mg loading dose and then continued at 10 mg \nonce a day. In UA/NSTEMI patients, where coronary angiography is performed within 48 hours after \nadmission, the loading dose should only be given at the time of PCI (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \nPatients taking Prasugrel Mylan should also take ASA daily (75 mg to 325 mg). \n \nIn patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are managed with PCI, premature \ndiscontinuation of any antiplatelet agent, including Prasugrel Mylan, could result in an increased risk \n\n\n\n3/43 \n\nof thrombosis, myocardial infarction or death due to the patient’s underlying disease. A treatment of \nup to 12 months is recommended unless the discontinuation of Prasugrel Mylan is clinically indicated \n(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nPatients ≥75 years old \nThe use of Prasugrel Mylan in patients ≥75 years of age is generally not recommended. If, after a \ncareful individual benefit/risk evaluation by the prescribing physician (see section 4.4), treatment is \ndeemed necessary in the patients age group ≥75 years, then following a 60 mg loading dose a reduced \nmaintenance dose of 5 mg should be prescribed. Patients ≥75 years of age have greater sensitivity to \nbleeding and higher exposure to the active metabolite of prasugrel (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPatients weighing <60 kg \nPrasugrel Mylan should be given as a single 60 mg loading dose and then continued at a 5 mg once \ndaily dose. The 10 mg maintenance dose is not recommended. This is due to an increase in exposure to \nthe active metabolite of prasugrel, and an increased risk of bleeding in patients with body weight \n<60 kg when given a 10 mg once daily dose compared with patients ≥60 kg (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment, including patients with end stage \nrenal disease (see section 5.2). There is limited therapeutic experience in patients with renal \nimpairment (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh \nclass A and B) (see section 5.2). There is limited therapeutic experience in patients with mild and \nmoderate hepatic dysfunction (see section 4.4). Prasugrel Mylan is contraindicated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Prasugrel Mylan in children below age 18 has not been established. Limited \ndata are available in children with sickle cell anaemia (see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPrasugrel Mylan is for oral use. It may be administered with or without food. Administration of the \n60 mg prasugrel loading dose in the fasted state may provide most rapid onset of action (see \nsection 5.2). The tablets should not be crushed or broken. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nActive pathological bleeding. \nHistory of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBleeding risk \nIn the phase 3 clinical trial (TRITON) key exclusion criteria included an increased risk of bleeding; \nanaemia; thrombocytopaenia; a history of pathological intracranial findings. Patients with acute \ncoronary syndromes undergoing PCI treated with prasugrel and ASA showed an increased risk of \nmajor and minor bleeding according to the TIMI classification system. Therefore, the use of prasugrel \nin patients at increased risk of bleeding should only be considered when the benefits in terms of \nprevention of ischaemic events are deemed to outweigh the risk of serious bleedings. This concern \napplies especially to patients: \n• ≥75 years of age (see below). \n\n\n\n4/43 \n\n• with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent \ngastrointestinal bleeding, or active peptic ulcer disease) \n\n• with body weight <60 kg (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). In these patients the 10 mg maintenance \ndose is not recommended. A 5 mg maintenance dose should be used. \n\n• with concomitant administration of medicinal products that may increase the risk of bleeding, \nincluding oral anticoagulants, clopidogrel, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and \nfibrinolytics. \n\n \nFor patients with active bleeding for whom reversal of the pharmacological effects of prasugrel is \nrequired, platelet transfusion may be appropriate. \n \nThe use of Prasugrel Mylan in patients ≥75 years of age is generally not recommended and should \nonly be undertaken with caution after a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation by the prescribing \nphysician indicates that benefits in terms of prevention of ischaemic events outweigh the risk of \nserious bleedings. In the phase 3 clinical trial these patients were at greater risk of bleeding, including \nfatal bleeding, compared to patients <75 years of age. If prescribed, a lower maintenance dose of 5 mg \nshould be used; the 10 mg maintenance dose is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nTherapeutic experience with prasugrel is limited in patients with renal impairment (including ESRD) \nand in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. These patients may have an increased bleeding risk. \nTherefore, prasugrel should be used with caution in these patients. \n \nPatients should be told that it might take longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take prasugrel \n(in combination with ASA), and that they should report any unusual bleeding (site or duration) to their \nphysician. \n \nBleeding risk associated with timing of loading dose in NSTEMI \nIn a clinical trial of NSTEMI patients (the ACCOAST study), where patients were scheduled to \nundergo coronary angiography within 2 to 48 hours after randomization, a prasugrel loading dose \ngiven on average 4 hours prior to coronary angiography increased the risk of major and minor peri-\nprocedural bleeding compared with a prasugrel loading dose at the time of PCI. Therefore, in \nUA/NSTEMI patients, where coronary angiography is performed within 48 hours after admission, the \nloading dose should be given at the time of PCI. (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nSurgery \nPatients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking prasugrel before any \nsurgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. If a patient is to undergo elective \nsurgery, and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, Prasugrel Mylan should be discontinued at least \n7 days prior to surgery. Increased frequency (3-fold) and severity of bleeding may occur in patients \nundergoing CABG surgery within 7 days of discontinuation of prasugrel (see section 4.8). The benefits \nand risks of prasugrel should be carefully considered in patients in whom the coronary anatomy has \nnot been defined and urgent CABG is a possibility. \n \nHypersensitivity including angioedema \nHypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have been reported in patients receiving prasugrel, \nincluding in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to clopidogrel. Monitoring for signs of \nhypersensitivity in patients with a known allergy to thienopyridines is advised (see section 4.8). \n \nThrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP) \nTTP has been reported with the use of prasugrel. TTP is a serious condition and requires prompt \ntreatment. \n \nMorphine and other opioids \nReduced prasugrel efficacy has been seen in patients co-administered prasugrel and morphine (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 5 mg contains sodium \n\n\n\n5/43 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \nPrasugrel Mylan 10 mg contains sunset yellow FCF aluminium lake (E110) and sodium \nSunset yellow FCF aluminium lake is an azo colouring agent, which may cause allergic reactions. \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nWarfarin \nConcomitant administration of Prasugrel Mylan with coumarin derivatives other than warfarin has not \nbeen studied. Because of the potential for increased risk of bleeding, warfarin (or other coumarin \nderivatives) and prasugrel should be co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \nConcomitant administration with chronic NSAIDs has not been studied. Because of the potential for \nincreased risk of bleeding, chronic NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors) and Prasugrel Mylan should \nbe co-administered with caution (see section 4.4). \n \nPrasugrel Mylan can be concomitantly administered with medicinal products metabolised by \ncytochrome P450 enzymes (including statins), or medicinal products that are inducers or inhibitors of \ncytochrome P450 enzymes. Prasugrel Mylan can also be concomitantly administered with ASA, \nheparin, digoxin, and medicinal products that elevate gastric pH, including proton pump inhibitors and \nH2 blockers. Although not studied in specific interaction studies, prasugrel has been co-administered in \nthe phase 3 clinical trial with low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (no \ninformation available regarding the type of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used) without evidence of clinically \nsignificant adverse interactions. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on Prasugrel Mylan \n \nAcetylsalicylic acid \nPrasugrel Mylan is to be administered concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Although a \npharmacodynamic interaction with ASA leading to an increased risk of bleeding is possible, the \ndemonstration of the efficacy and safety of prasugrel comes from patients concomitantly treated with \nASA. \n \nHeparin \nA single intravenous bolus dose of unfractionated heparin (100 U/kg) did not significantly alter the \nprasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Likewise, prasugrel did not significantly alter the \neffect of heparin on measures of coagulation. Therefore, both medicinal products can be administered \nconcomitantly. An increased risk of bleeding is possible when Prasugrel Mylan is co-administered \nwith heparin. \n \nStatins \nAtorvastatin (80 mg daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel and its inhibition of platelet \naggregation. Therefore, statins that are substrates of CYP3A are not anticipated to have an effect on \nthe pharmacokinetics of prasugrel or its inhibition of platelet aggregation. \n \nMedicinal products that elevate gastric pH \nDaily co administration of ranitidine (an H2 blocker) or lansoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) did not \nchange the prasugrel active metabolite’s AUC and Tmax, but decreased the Cmax by 14% and 29%, \nrespectively. In the phase 3 clinical trial, prasugrel was administered without regard to co \nadministration of a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker. Administration of the 60 mg prasugrel \nloading dose without concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors may provide most rapid onset of \naction. \n\n\n\n6/43 \n\n \nInhibitors of CYP3A \nKetoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, did not affect \nprasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation or the prasugrel active metabolite’s AUC and \nTmax, but decreased the Cmax by 34% to 46%. Therefore, CYP3A inhibitors such as azol antifungals, \nHIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, verapamil, diltiazem, indinavir, ciprofloxacin, \nand grapefruit juice are not anticipated to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the \nactive metabolite. \n \nInducers of cytochromes P450 \nRifampicin (600 mg daily), a potent inducer of CYP3A and CYP2B6, and an inducer of CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, and CYP2C8, did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel. Therefore, \nknown CYP3A inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, and other inducers of cytochromes P450 \nare not anticipated to have significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite. \n \nMorphine and other opioids \nA delayed and decreased exposure to oral P2Y12 inhibitors, including prasugrel and its active \nmetabolite, has been observed in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with morphine. This \ninteraction may be related to reduced gastrointestinal motility and apply to other opioids. The clinical \nrelevance is unknown, but data indicate the potential for reduced prasugrel efficacy in patients co-\nadministered prasugrel and morphine. In patients with acute coronary syndrome, in whom morphine \ncannot be withheld and fast P2Y12 inhibition is deemed crucial, the use of a parenteral P2Y12 \ninhibitor may be considered. \n \nEffects of Prasugrel Mylan on other medicinal products \n \nDigoxin \nPrasugrel has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 \nPrasugrel did not inhibit CYP2C9, as it did not affect the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin. Because of \nthe potential for increased risk of bleeding, warfarin and Prasugrel Mylan should be co-administered \nwith caution (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 \nPrasugrel is a weak inhibitor of CYP2B6. In healthy subjects, prasugrel decreased exposure to \nhydroxybupropion, a CYP2B6-mediated metabolite of bupropion, by 23%. This effect is likely to be of \nclinical concern only when prasugrel is co administered with medicinal products for which CYP2B6 is \nthe only metabolic pathway and have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclophosphamide, \nefavirenz). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nNo clinical study has been conducted in pregnant or breast-feeding women. \n \nPregnancy \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). Because animal reproduction \nstudies are not always predictive of a human response, Prasugrel Mylan should be used during \npregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether prasugrel is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of prasugrel in breast milk. The use of prasugrel during breastfeeding is not recommended. \n \n\n\n\n7/43 \n\nFertility \nPrasugrel had no effect on fertility of male and female rats at oral doses up to an exposure 240 times \nthe recommended daily human maintenance dose (based on mg/m²). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPrasugrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nSafety in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI was evaluated in one clopidogrel \ncontrolled study (TRITON) in which 6741 patients were treated with prasugrel (60 mg loading dose \nand 10 mg once daily maintenance dose) for a median of 14.5 months (5802 patients were treated for \nover 6 months; 4136 patients were treated for more than 1 year). The rate of study drug \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events was 7.2% for prasugrel and 6.3% for clopidogrel. Of these, \nbleeding was the most common adverse reaction for both drugs leading to study drug discontinuation \n(2.5% for prasugrel and 1.4% for clopidogrel). \n \nBleeding \nNon-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) related bleeding \nIn TRITON, the frequency of patients experiencing a non-CABG related bleeding event is shown in \nTable 1. The incidence of Non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding, including life-threatening and \nfatal, as well as TIMI minor bleeding, was statistically significantly higher in subjects treated with \nprasugrel compared to clopidogrel in the UA/NSTEMI and All ACS populations. No significant \ndifference was seen in the STEMI population. The most common site of spontaneous bleeding was the \ngastrointestinal tract (1.7% rate with prasugrel and 1.3% rate with clopidogrel); the most frequent site \nof provoked bleeding was the arterial puncture site (1.3% rate with prasugrel and 1.2% with \nclopidogrel). \n \nTable 1: Incidence of Non-CABG related bleedinga (% Patients) \n \n\nEvent \n\nAll ACS UA/NSTEMI STEMI \nPrasugrelb + \n\nASA \n(N=6741) \n\nClopidogrelb + \nASA (N=6716)\n\nPrasugrelb + \nASA \n\n(N=5001) \nClopidogrelb + \nASA (N=4980)\n\nPrasugrelb + \nASA \n\n(N=1740) \nClopidogrelb + \nASA (N=1736)\n\nTIMI major \nbleedingc 2.2 1.7 2.2 1.6 2.2 2.0 \n\nLife-\nthreateningd 1.3 0.8 1.3 0.8 1.2 1.0 \n\nFatal 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.4 0.1\nSymptomatic \nICHe 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 \n\nRequiring \ninotropes 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.2 \n\nRequiring \nsurgical \nintervention \n\n0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.2 \n\nRequiring \ntransfusion \n(≥4 units) \n\n0.7 0.5 0.6 0.3 0.8 0.8 \n\nTIMI minor \nbleedingf 2.4 1.9 2.3 1.6 2.7 2.6 \n\n \n\n\n\n8/43 \n\na Centrally adjudicated events defined by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study \nGroup criteria. \n\nb Other standard therapies were used as appropriate. \nc Any intracranial haemorrhage or any clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in \n\nhaemoglobin ≥5 g/dL. \nd Life-threatening bleeding is a subset of TIMI major bleeding and includes the types indented below. \n\nPatients may be counted in more than one row. \ne ICH = intracranial haemorrhage. \nf Clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in haemoglobin of ≥3 g/dL but <5 g/dL. \n \nPatients ≥75 years old \nNon-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding rates: \n \nAge Prasugrel 10 mg Clopidogrel 75 mg \n≥75 years (N=1785)* 9.0% (1.0% fatal) 6.9% (0.1% fatal) \n<75 years (N=11672)* 3.8% (0.2% fatal) 2.9% (0.1% fatal) \n<75 years (N=7180)** 2.0% (0.1% fatal)a 1.3% (0.1% fatal) \n Prasugrel 5 mg Clopidogrel 75 mg \n≥75 years (N=2060)** 2.6% (0.3% fatal) 3.0% (0.5% fatal) \n\n \n* TRITON study in ACS patients undergoing PCI \n** TRILOGY-ACS study in patients not undergoing PCI (see 5.1): \na 10 mg prasugrel; 5 mg prasugrel if <60 kg \n \nPatients <60 kg \nNon-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding rates: \n \nWeight Prasugrel 10 mg Clopidogrel 75 mg \n<60 kg (N=664)* 10.1% (0% fatal) 6.5% (0.3% fatal) \n≥60 kg (N=12672)* 4.2% (0.3% fatal) 3.3% (0.1% fatal) \n≥60 kg (N=7845)** 2.2% (0.2% fatal)a 1.6% (0.2% fatal) \n Prasugrel 5 mg Clopidogrel 75 mg \n<60kg (N=1391)** 1.4% (0.1% fatal) 2.2% (0.3% fatal) \n\n \n* TRITON study in ACS patients undergoing PCI \n** TRILOGY-ACS study in patients not undergoing PCI (see 5.1): \na 10 mg prasugrel; 5 mg prasugrel if ≥75 years of age \n \nPatients ≥60 kg and age <75 years \nIn patients ≥60 kg and age <75 years, non-CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding rates were \n3.6% for prasugrel and 2.8% for clopidogrel; rates for fatal bleeding were 0.2% for prasugrel and 0.1% \nfor clopidogrel. \n \nCABG-related bleeding \nIn the phase 3 clinical trial, 437 patients underwent CABG during the course of the study. Of those \npatients, the rate of CABG-related TIMI major or minor bleeding was 14.1% for the prasugrel group \nand 4.5% in the clopidogrel group. The higher risk for bleeding events in subjects treated with \nprasugrel persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. For patients who received \ntheir thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI major or minor bleeding \nwere 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the prasugrel group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the \nclopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior \nto CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of \n89 patients) in the clopidogrel group. Beyond 7 days after drug discontinuation, the observed rates of \nCABG-related bleeding were similar between treatment groups (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n9/43 \n\nBleeding risk associated with timing of loading dose in NSTEMI \nIn a clinical study of NSTEMI patients (the ACCOAST study), where patients were scheduled to \nundergo coronary angiography within 2 to 48 hours after randomization, patients given a 30 mg \nloading dose on average 4 hours prior to coronary angiography followed by a 30 mg loading dose at \nthe time of PCI had an increased risk of non-CABG peri-procedural bleeding and no additional benefit \ncompared to patients receiving a 60 mg loading dose at the time of PCI (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \nNon-CABG- related TIMI bleeding rates through 7 days for patients were as follows: \n \n\nAdverse reaction Prasugrel prior to coronary angiographya (N=2037) % \nPrasugrel at time of PCIa \n\n(N=1996) % \nTIMI Major bleedingb 1.3 0.5 \nLife-threateningc 0.8 0.2 \nFatal 0.1 0.0 \nSymptomatic ICHd 0.0 0.0 \nRequiring inotropes 0.3 0.2 \nRequiring surgical intervention 0.4 0.1 \nRequiring transfusion (≥4 units) 0.3 0.1 \nTIMI Minor bleedinge 1.7 0.6 \n\n \na Other standard therapies were used as appropriate.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose of Prasugrel Mylan may lead to prolonged bleeding time and subsequent bleeding \ncomplications. No data are available on the reversal of the pharmacological effect of prasugrel; \nhowever, if prompt correction of prolonged bleeding time is required, platelet transfusion and/or other \nblood products may be considered. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, \nATC code: B01AC22. \n \nMechanism of action / Pharmacodynamic effects \nPrasugrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its \nactive metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Since platelets participate in the \ninitiation and/or evolution of thrombotic complications of atherosclerotic disease, inhibition of platelet \nfunction can result in the reduction of the rate of cardiovascular events such as death, myocardial \ninfarction, or stroke. \n\n\n\n11/43 \n\n \nFollowing a 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation occurs at \n15 minutes with 5 µM ADP and 30 minutes with 20 µM ADP. The maximum inhibition by prasugrel \nof ADP-induced platelet aggregation is 83% with 5 µM ADP and 79% with 20 µM ADP, in both cases \nwith 89% of healthy subjects and patients with stable atherosclerosis achieving at least 50% inhibition \nof platelet aggregation by 1 hour. Prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation exhibits low \nbetween-subject (9%) and within-subject (12%) variability with both 5 µM and 20 µM ADP. Mean \nsteady-state inhibition of platelet aggregation was 74% and 69% respectively for 5 µM ADP and \n20 µM ADP, and was achieved following 3 to 5 days of administration of the 10 mg prasugrel \nmaintenance dose preceded by a 60 mg loading dose. More than 98% of subjects had ≥20% inhibition \nof platelet aggregation during maintenance dosing. \n \nPlatelet aggregation gradually returned to baseline values after treatment in 7 to 9 days after \nadministration of a single 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel and in 5 days following discontinuation of \nmaintenance dosing at steady-state. \n \nSwitching data \nFollowing administration of 75 mg clopidogrel once daily for 10 days, 40 healthy subjects were \nswitched to prasugrel 10 mg once daily with or without a loading dose of 60 mg. Similar or higher \ninhibition of platelet aggregation was observed with prasugrel. Switching directly to prasugrel 60 mg \nloading dose resulted in the most rapid onset of higher platelet inhibition. Following administration of \na 900 mg loading dose of clopidogrel (with ASA), 56 subjects with ACS were treated for 14 days with \neither prasugrel 10 mg once daily or clopidogrel 150 mg once daily, and then switched to either \nclopidogrel 150 mg or prasugrel 10 mg for another 14 days. Higher inhibition of platelet aggregation \nwas observed in patients switched to prasugrel 10 mg compared with those treated with clopidogrel \n150 mg. In a study of 276 ACS patients managed with PCI, switching from an initial loading dose of \n600 mg clopidogrel or placebo administered upon presentation to the hospital prior to coronary \nangiography to a 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel administered at the time of percutaneous coronary \nintervention, resulted in a similar increased inhibition of platelet aggregation for the 72 hour duration \nof the study. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) \nThe phase 3 TRITON study compared prasugrel with clopidogrel, both co-administered with ASA and \nother standard therapy. TRITON was a 13,608 patient, multicentre international, randomised, double \nblind, parallel group study. Patients had ACS with moderate to high risk UA, NSTEMI, or STEMI and \nwere managed with PCI. \n \nPatients with UA/NSTEMI within 72 hours of symptoms or STEMI between 12 hours to 14 days of \nsymptoms were randomised after knowledge of coronary anatomy. Patients with STEMI within \n12 hours of symptoms and planned for primary PCI could be randomised without knowledge of \ncoronary anatomy. For all patients, the loading dose could be administered anytime between \nrandomisation and 1 hour after the patient left the catheterisation lab. \n \nPatients randomised to receive prasugrel (60 mg loading dose followed by 10 mg once daily) or \nclopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) were treated for a median of \n14.5 months (maximum of 15 months with a minimum of 6 months follow-up). Patients also received \nASA (75 mg to 325 mg once daily). Use of any thienopyridine within 5 days before enrolment was an \nexclusion criterion. Other therapies, such as heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, were administered at \nthe discretion of the physician. Approximately 40% of patients (in each of the treatment groups) \nreceived GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in support of PCI (no information available regarding the type of \nGP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used). Approximately 98% of patients (in each of the treatment groups) received \nantithrombins (heparin, low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, or other agent) directly in support \nof PCI. \n \n\n\n\n12/43 \n\nThe trial’s primary outcome measure was the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, \nnon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal stroke. Analysis of the composite endpoint in the All \nACS population (combined UA/NSTEMI and STEMI cohorts) was contingent on showing statistical \nsuperiority of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in the UA/NSTEMI cohort (p<0.05). \n \nAll ACS population \nPrasugrel showed superior efficacy compared to clopidogrel in reducing the primary composite \noutcome events as well as the pre-specified secondary outcome events, including stent thrombosis (see \nTable 3). The benefit of prasugrel was apparent within the first 3 days and it persisted to the end of \nstudy. The superior efficacy was accompanied by an increase in major bleeding (see sections 4.4 and \n4.8). The patient population was 92% Caucasian, 26% female, and 39% ≥65 years of age. The benefits \nassociated with prasugrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular \ntherapies, including heparin/low molecular weight heparin, bivalirudin, intravenous GP IIb/IIIa \ninhibitors, lipid-lowering medicinal products, beta-blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors. The efficacy of prasugrel was independent of the ASA dose (75 mg to 325 mg once daily). \nThe use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet medicinal products and chronic NSAIDs was not \nallowed in TRITON. In the All ACS population, prasugrel was associated with a lower incidence of \nCV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke compared to clopidogrel, regardless of baseline \ncharacteristics such as age, sex, body weight, geographical region, use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and \nstent type. The benefit was primarily due to a significant decrease in non-fatal MI (see Table 3). \nSubjects with diabetes had significant reductions in the primary and all secondary composite \nendpoints. \n \nThe observed benefit of prasugrel in patients ≥75 years was less than that observed in patients \n<75 years. Patients ≥75 years were at increased risk of bleeding, including fatal (see sections 4.2, 4.4, \nand 4.8). Patients ≥75 years in whom the benefit with prasugrel was more evident included those with \ndiabetes, STEMI, higher risk of stent thrombosis, or recurrent events. \n \nPatients with a history of TIA or a history of ischaemic stroke more than 3 months prior to prasugrel \ntherapy had no reduction in the primary composite endpoint. \n \nTable 3: Patients with outcome events in TRITON primary analysis \n \n\nOutcome Events Prasugrel + ASA \nClopidogrel + \n\nASA \nHazard Ratio \n\n(HR) (95% CI) p-value \n\nAll ACS (N=6813) % (N=6795) % \n\n0.812 (0.732, \n0.902) <0.001 \n\nPrimary \nComposite \nOutcome Events \nCardiovascular \n(CV) death, non \nfatal MI, or non \nfatal stroke \n\n9.4 11.5 \n\nPrimary Individual Outcome Events \n\nCV death 2.0 2.2 0.886 (0.701, 1.118) 0.307 \n\nNon fatal MI 7.0 9.1 0.757 (0.672, 0.853) <0.001 \n\nNon fatal stroke 0.9 0.9 1.016 (0.712, 1.451) 0.930 \n\n\n\n13/43 \n\nUA/NSTEMI \nPrimary \nComposite \nOutcome Events \n\n(N=5044) % (N=5030) %   \n\nCV death, nonfatal \nMI, or nonfatal \nstroke \n\n9.3 11.2 0.820 (0.726, 0.927) 0.002 \n\nCV death 1.8 1.8 0.979 (0.732,1.309) 0.885 \n\nNon-fatal MI 7.1 9.2 0.761 (0.663,0.873) <0.001 \n\nNon-fatal stroke 0.8 0.8 0.979 (0.633,1.513) 0.922 \n\nSTEMI Primary \nComposite \nOutcome Events \n\n(N=1769) % (N=1765) %   \n\nCV death, nonfatal \nMI, or nonfatal \nstroke \n\n9.8 12.2 0.793 (0.649, 0.968) 0.019 \n\nCV death 2.4 3.3 0.738 (0.497,1.094) 0.129 \n\nNon-fatal MI 6.7 8.8 0.746 (0.588,0.948) 0.016 \n\nNon-fatal stroke 1.2 1.1 1.097 (0.590,2.040) 0.770 \n\n \nIn the All ACS population, analysis of each of the secondary endpoints showed a significant benefit \n(p<0.001) for prasugrel versus clopidogrel. These included definite or probable stent thrombosis at \nstudy end (0.9% vs 1.8%; HR 0.498; CI 0.364, 0.683); CV death, nonfatal MI, or urgent target vessel \nrevascularisation through 30 days (5.9% vs 7.4%; HR 0.784; CI 0.688,0.894); all cause death, nonfatal \nMI, or nonfatal stroke through study end (10.2% vs 12.1%; HR 0.831; CI 0.751, 0.919); CV death, \nnon-fatal MI, nonfatal stroke or rehospitalisation for cardiac ischaemic event through study end \n(11.7% vs 13.8%; HR 0.838; CI 0.762, 0.921). Analysis of all cause death did not show any significant \ndifference between prasugrel and clopidogrel in the All ACS population (2.76% vs 2.90%), in the \nUA/NSTEMI population (2.58% vs 2.41%), and in the STEMI population (3.28% vs 4.31%). \n \nPrasugrel was associated with a 50% reduction in stent thrombosis through the 15 month follow-up \nperiod. The reduction in stent thrombosis with prasugrel was observed both early and beyond 30 days \nfor both bare metal and drug eluting stents. \n \nIn an analysis of patients who survived an ischaemic event, prasugrel was associated with a reduction \nin the incidence of subsequent primary endpoint events (7.8% for prasugrel vs 11.9% for clopidogrel). \nAlthough bleeding was increased with prasugrel, an analysis of the composite endpoint of death from \nany cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and non-CABG-related TIMI major \nhaemorrhage favoured prasugrel compared to clopidogrel (Hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95; \np=0.004). In TRITON, for every 1000 patients treated with prasugrel, there were 22 fewer patients \nwith myocardial infarction, and 5 more with non–CABG-related TIMI major haemorrhages, compared \nwith patients treated with clopidogrel. \n \nResults of a pharmacodynamic/pharmacogenomic study in 720 Asian ACS PCI patients demonstrated \nthat higher levels of platelet inhibition are achieved with prasugrel compared to clopidogrel, and that \nprasugrel 60 mg loading dose/10 mg maintenance dose is an appropriate dose regimen in Asian \nsubjects who weigh at least 60 kg and are less than 75 years of age (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n14/43 \n\nIn a 30 month study (TRILOGY–ACS) in 9326 patients with UA/NSTEMI ACS medically managed \nwithout revascularisation (non-licensed indication), prasugrel did not significantly reduce the \nfrequency of the composite endpoint of CV death, MI or stroke compared to clopidogrel. Rates of \nTIMI major bleeding (including life threatening, fatal and ICH) were similar in prasugrel and \nclopidogrel treated patients. Patients ≥75 years old or those below 60 kg (N=3022) were randomized to \n5 mg prasugrel. As in the <75 years old and ≥60 kg patients treated with 10 mg prasugrel, there was no \ndifference between 5 mg prasugrel and 75 mg clopidogrel in CV outcomes. Rates of major bleeding \nwere similar in patients treated with 5 mg prasugrel and those treated with 75 mg clopidogrel. \nPrasugrel 5 mg provided greater antiplatelet effect than clopidogrel 75 mg. Prasugrel should be used \nwith caution in patients ≥75 years old and in patients weighing <60 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nIn a 30-day study (ACCOAST) in 4033 patients with NSTEMI with elevated troponin who were \nscheduled for coronary angiography followed by PCI within 2 to 48 hours after randomization, \nsubjects who received prasugrel 30 mg loading dose on average 4 hours prior to coronary angiography \nfollowed by a 30 mg loading dose at the time of PCI (n=2037) had an increased risk of non-CABG \nperi-procedural bleeding and no additional benefit compared to patients receiving a 60 mg loading \ndose at the time of PCI (n=1996). Specifically, prasugrel did not significantly reduce the frequency of \nthe composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, urgent \nrevascularization (UR), or glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor bailout through 7 days from \nrandomization in subjects receiving prasugrel prior to coronary angiography compared to patients \nreceiving the full loading dose of prasugrel at the time of PCI, and the rate of the key safety objective \nfor all TIMI major bleeding (CABG and non-CABG events) through 7 days from randomization in all \ntreated subjects was significantly higher in subjects receiving prasugrel prior to coronary angiography \nversus patients receiving the full loading dose of prasugrel at the time of PCI. Therefore, in \nUA/NSTEMI patients, where coronary angiography is performed within 48 hours after admission, the \nloading dose should be given at the time of PCI. (See sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8) \n \nPaediatric population \nStudy TADO teste the use of prasugrel (n=171) vs placebo (n=170) in patients, ages 2 to less than \n18 years of age, with sickle cell anaemia for reduction of vaso occlusive crisis in a phase III study. The \nstudy failed to meet any of the primary or secondary endpoints. Overall, no new safety findings were \nidentified for prasugrel as monotherapy in this patient population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPrasugrel is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised in vivo to an active metabolite and inactive \nmetabolites. The active metabolite’s exposure (AUC) has moderate to low between-subject (27%) and \nwithin-subject (19%) variability. Prasugrel’s pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects, patients \nwith stable atherosclerosis, and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. \n \nAbsorption \nThe absorption and metabolism of prasugrel are rapid, with peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of the \nactive metabolite occurring in approximately 30 minutes. The active metabolite’s exposure (AUC) \nincreases proportionally over the therapeutic dose range. In a study of healthy subjects, AUC of the \nactive metabolite was unaffected by a high fat, high calorie meal, but Cmax was decreased by 49% and \nthe time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was increased from 0.5 to 1.5 hours. Prasugrel was administered without \nregard to food in TRITON. Therefore, prasugrel can be administered without regard to food; however, \nthe administration of prasugrel loading dose in the fasted state may provide most rapid onset of action \n(see section 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nActive metabolite binding to human serum albumin (4% buffered solution) was 98%. \n \nBiotransformation \nPrasugrel is not detected in plasma following oral administration. It is rapidly hydrolysed in \ntheintestine to a thiolactone, which is then converted to the active metabolite by a single step of \ncytochrome P450 metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 \n\n\n\n15/43 \n\nand CYP2C19. The active metabolite is further metabolised to two inactive compounds by \nS-methylation or conjugation with cysteine. \n \nIn healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients with ACS receiving prasugrel, \nthere was no relevant effect of genetic variation in CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 on the \npharmacokinetics of prasugrel or its inhibition of platelet aggregation. \n \nElimination \nApproximately 68% of the prasugrel dose is excreted in the urine and 27% in the faeces, as inactive \nmetabolites. The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 7.4 hours (range 2 to 15 hours). \n \nPharmacokinetic in special populations \n \nElderly \nIn a study of healthy subjects between the ages of 20 and 80 years, age had no significant effect on \npharmacokinetics of prasugrel or its inhibition of platelet aggregation. In the large phase 3 clinical \ntrial, the mean estimated exposure (AUC) of the active metabolite was 19% higher in very elderly \npatients (≥75 years of age) compared to subjects <75 years of age. Prasugrel should be used with \ncaution in patients ≥75 years of age due to the potential risk of bleeding in this population (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In a study in subjects with stable atherosclerosis, the mean AUC of the active \nmetabolite in patients ≥75 years old taking 5 mg prasugrel was approximately half that in patients \n<65 years old taking 10 mg prasugrel, and the antiplatelet effect of 5 mg was reduced but was non-\ninferior compared to 10 mg. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate impaired hepatic function (Child \nPugh Class A and B). Pharmacokinetics of prasugrel and its inhibition of platelet aggregation were \nsimilar in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. \nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prasugrel in patients with severe hepatic impairment have \nnot been studied. Prasugrel must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment, including patients with end \nstage renal disease (ESRD). Pharmacokinetics of prasugrel and its inhibition of platelet aggregation \nare similar in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30<50 ml/min/1.73 m²) and healthy \nsubjects. Prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation was also similar in patients with ESRD \nwho required haemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, although Cmax and AUC of the active \nmetabolite decreased 51% and 42%, respectively, in ESRD patients. \n \nBody weight \nThe mean exposure (AUC) of the active metabolite of prasugrel is approximately 30 to 40% higher in \nhealthy subjects and patients with a body weight of <60 kg compared to those weighing ≥60 kg. \nPrasugrel should be used with caution in patients with a body weight of <60 kg due to the potential \nrisk of bleeding in this population (see section 4.4). In a study in subjects with stable atherosclerosis, \nthe mean AUC of the active metabolite in patients <60 kg taking 5 mg prasugrel was 38% lower than \nin patients ≥60 kg taking 10 mg prasugrel, and the antiplatelet effect of 5 mg was similar to 10 mg. \n \nEthnicity \nIn clinical pharmacology studies, after adjusting for body weight, the AUC of the active metabolite \nwas approximately 19% higher in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean subjects compared to that of \nCaucasians, predominantly related to higher exposure in Asian subjects <60 kg. There is no difference \nin exposure among Chinese, Japanese, and Korean subjects. Exposure in subjects of African and \nHispanic descent is comparable to that of Caucasians. No dose adjustment is recommended based on \nethnicity alone. \n \n\n\n\n16/43 \n\nGender \nIn healthy subjects and patients, the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel are similar in men and women. \n \nPaediatric population: \nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prasugrel have not been evaluated in a paediatric \npopulation (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, or toxicity to reproduction. \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nEmbryo-foetal developmental toxicology studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of \nmalformations due to prasugrel. At a very high dose (>240 times the recommended daily human \nmaintenance dose on a mg/m² basis) that caused effects on maternal body weight and/or food \nconsumption, there was a slight decrease in offspring body weight (relative to controls). In pre- and \npost-natal rat studies, maternal treatment had no effect on the behavioural or reproductive development \nof the offspring at doses up to an exposure 240 times the recommended daily human maintenance dose \n(based on mg/m²). \n \nNo compound-related tumours were observed in a 2-year rat study with prasugrel exposures ranging to \ngreater than 75 times the recommended therapeutic exposures in humans (based on plasma exposures \nto the active and major circulating human metabolites). There was an increased incidence of tumours \n(hepatocellular adenomas) in mice exposed for 2 years to high doses (>75 times human exposure), but \nthis was considered secondary to prasugrel-induced enzyme-induction. The rodent-specific association \nof liver tumours and drug-induced enzyme induction is well documented in the literature. The increase \nin liver tumours with prasugrel administration in mice is not considered a relevant human risk. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n– This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n– If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Prasugrel Mylan is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Prasugrel Mylan is and what it is used for \n \nPrasugrel Mylan, which contains the active substance prasugrel, belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled antiplatelet agents. Platelets are very small cell particles that circulate in the blood. When a \nblood vessel is damaged, for example if it is cut, platelets clump together to help form a blood clot \n(thrombus). Therefore, platelets are essential to help stop bleeding. If clots form within a hardened \nblood vessel such as an artery they can be very dangerous as they can cut off the blood supply, causing \na heart attack (myocardial infarction), stroke or death. Clots in arteries supplying blood to the heart \nmay also reduce the blood supply, causing unstable angina (a severe chest pain). \n \nPrasugrel Mylan inhibits the clumping of platelets and so reduces the chance of a blood clot forming. \n \nYou have been prescribed Prasugrel Mylan because you have already had a heart attack or unstable \nangina and you have been treated with a procedure to open blocked arteries in the heart. You may also \nhave had one or more stents placed to keep open a blocked or narrowed artery supplying blood to the \nheart. Prasugrel Mylan reduces the chances of you having a further heart attack or stroke or of dying \nfrom one of these atherothrombotic events. Your doctor will also give you acetylsalicylic acid (e.g. \naspirin), another antiplatelet agent. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Prasugrel Mylan \n \nDo not take Prasugrel Mylan if you \n– are allergic to prasugrel or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). An \n\nallergic reaction may be recognised as a rash, itching, a swollen face, swollen lips or shortness \nof breath.
