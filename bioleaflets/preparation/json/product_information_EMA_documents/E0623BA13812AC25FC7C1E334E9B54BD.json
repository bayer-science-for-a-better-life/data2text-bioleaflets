CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nIsturisa is indicated for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in adults. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in endocrinology or internal \n\nmedicine and with access to the appropriate facilities for monitoring of biochemical responses since \n\nthe dose must be adjusted to meet the patient’s therapeutic needs, based on the normalisation of \n\ncortisol levels. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg osilodrostat twice daily. For patients of Asian ancestry, a \n\nreduced starting dose of 1 mg twice daily is recommended (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe dose can be gradually titrated (initially by dose increments of 1 or 2 mg) based on individual \n\nresponse and tolerability, with the aim to achieve normal cortisol levels. It is recommended that \n\ncortisol levels (e.g. 24-hour urinary free cortisol, serum/plasma cortisol) be monitored every 1-2 weeks \n\nuntil adequate clinical response is maintained. Thereafter, less frequent monitoring may be considered \n\nas clinically indicated, unless there are reasons for additional monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nIncreases in dose should not occur more frequently than once every 1-2 weeks and should be guided \n\nby the results of cortisol assessments and by the individual clinical response. \n\n \n\nThe dose of osilodrostat should be decreased or treatment temporarily interrupted if cortisol levels are \n\nbelow the lower limit of normal, or if there is a rapid decrease in cortisol levels to the lower part of the \n\nnormal range, or if the patient has signs or symptoms suggestive of hypocortisolism (see section 4.4). \n\nIsturisa may be resumed after resolution of symptoms at a lower dose, provided that cortisol levels are \n\nabove the lower limit of normal in the absence of glucocorticoid substitution. Management of other \n\nsuspected adverse reactions at any time during treatment may also require a temporary dose reduction \n\nor temporary interruption of treatment. \n\n \n\nThe usual maintenance dose in clinical studies varied between 2 and 7 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nThe maximum recommended dose of Isturisa is 30 mg twice daily. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, the patient should take the prescribed dose at the next scheduled time; the next \n\ndose should not be doubled. \n\n \n\nElderly (65 years or above) \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above. \n\nHowever, data on the use of osilodrostat in this population are limited and Isturisa should therefore be \n\nused with caution in this age group. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Urinary free \n\ncortisol (UFC) levels should be interpreted with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal \n\nimpairment, due to reduced UFC excretion. Alternative methods for cortisol monitoring should be \n\nconsidered in these patients. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). For patients \n\nwith moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), the recommended starting dose is 1 mg twice \n\ndaily. For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the recommended starting dose is \n\n1 mg once daily in the evening, with initial up-titration to 1 mg twice daily (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nData on use in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. More frequent monitoring of adrenal \n\nfunction may be required in patients with hepatic impairment during dose titration. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Isturisa in patients less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. \n\n \n\nIsturisa can be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nHypocortisolism \n\n \n\nInhibition of cortisol synthesis by osilodrostat has led to hypocortisolism-related events such as \n\ncortisol withdrawal syndrome (symptomatic decrease of cortisol levels, but still above the lower limit \n\nof the normal range) and adrenal insufficiency (cortisol levels below the normal range). \n\n \n\nCortisol levels should be monitored at regular intervals (see section 4.2), since hypocortisolism-related \n\nevents can occur at any time during treatment. Additional monitoring is recommended especially \n\nduring conditions of increased cortisol demand, such as physical or psychological stress, or during \n\nchanges in concomitant medications that may affect osilodrostat exposure (see section 4.5). It is \n\nrecommended to use laboratory methods that do not exhibit significant cross-reactivity with cortisol \n\nprecursors such as 11-deoxycortisol that may increase during osilodrostat treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients should be alerted to the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g. nausea, \n\nvomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and dizziness). \n\n \n\nSymptomatic patients should be monitored for hypotension, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and/or \n\nhypoglycaemia. If hypocortisolism is suspected, cortisol levels should be measured and temporary \n\ndose reduction or interruption of osilodrostat considered. If necessary, corticosteroid substitution \n\nshould be initiated. Isturisa may be resumed after resolution of symptoms at a lower dose, provided \n\nthat cortisol levels are above the lower limit of normal in the absence of glucocorticoid substitution. \n\n \n\nQTc prolongation \n\n \n\nIn a thorough QT study, osilodrostat was associated with a dose-dependent QT interval prolongation \n\n(mean maximum estimated QTcF increase by +5.3 ms at the highest recommended dose of 30 mg) \n\nwhich may cause cardiac arrhythmias (see section 5.1). Adverse reactions of QT prolongation and \n\nclinically relevant ECG findings have been reported in clinical studies. \n\n \n\nAn ECG should be performed prior to the start of Isturisa treatment, within one week after treatment \n\ninitiation, and as clinically indicated thereafter. If the QTc interval exceeds 480 ms prior to or during \n\ntreatment, cardiology consultation is recommended. Temporary dose reduction or interruption may be \n\nrequired. \n\n \n\nAny hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to Isturisa \n\nadministration and electrolyte levels should be monitored periodically during therapy. \n\n \n\nIsturisa should be used with caution and the benefit-risk carefully weighed in patients with risk factors \n\nfor QT prolongation such as: \n\n- congenital long QT syndrome, \n- significant cardiovascular disease (including congestive heart failure, recent myocardial \n\ninfarction, unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, advanced heart block and \n\nclinically significant bradyarrhythmias), and \n\n\n\n5 \n\n- concomitant medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5). \nIf Isturisa is used in patients with these risk factors, more frequent ECG monitoring is recommended. \n\n \n\nCorticotroph tumour growth \n\n \n\nDiscontinuation of osilodrostat treatment should be considered in patients who develop MRI-verified \n\ncorticotroph tumour invasiveness during treatment. \n\n \n\nConcomitant use with strong enzyme inhibitors and inducers \n\n \n\nCaution and closer monitoring are advised when co-administered medicinal products that strongly \n\ninhibit or induce multiple enzymes are introduced or discontinued during osilodrostat treatment (see \n\nsection 4.5), as they may affect osilodrostat exposure and may result in a risk of adverse events (due to \n\na potential increase in exposure) or of decreased efficacy (due to a potential decrease in exposure). \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nIsturisa may cause foetal harm. Pregnancy status should be verified in women of childbearing \n\npotential prior to the initiation of Isturisa, and these patients should be advised of a potential risk to the \n\nfoetus and of the need to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after \n\nstopping treatment (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nPotential pharmacodynamic interactions \n\n \n\nCo-administration of osilodrostat with other therapies known to affect the QT interval can lead to QT \n\nprolongation in patients with known cardiac rhythm disorders (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). A washout \n\nperiod should be considered when switching from other products known to affect the QT interval such \n\nas pasireotide or ketoconazole. \n\n \n\nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of osilodrostat \n\n \n\nThe potential for clinical drug-drug interactions (DDI) with concomitantly administered medicinal \n\nproducts that inhibit transporters or a single CYP or UGT enzyme is low (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nStrong enzyme inhibitors \n\nCaution is advised when co-administered medicinal products that strongly inhibit multiple enzymes \n\nare introduced or discontinued during osilodrostat treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nStrong enzyme inducers \n\nCaution is advised when co-administered medicinal products that strongly induce multiple enzymes \n\n(e.g. rifampin) are introduced or discontinued during osilodrostat treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nEffects of osilodrostat on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n\n \n\nBecause osilodrostat and its major metabolite M34.5 may inhibit and/or induce multiple enzymes and \n\ntransporters, general caution is advised when osilodrostat is co-administered with sensitive enzyme or \n\ntransporter substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. Available interaction data is summarised below \n\n(see also section 5.2). \n\n \n\nClinical studies \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study (n=20) using a single dose of 50 mg osilodrostat and a probe drug \n\ncocktail, osilodrostat was found to be a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5, a mild to moderate \n\ninhibitor of CYP2C19, and a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2. \n\n- CYP2D6 – AUC geometric mean ratio of 1.5 for dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) when \ndosed with osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n- CYP3A4 – AUC geometric mean ratio of 1.5 for midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) when dosed \nwith osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. \n\n- CYP2C19 –AUC geometric mean ratio of 1.9 for omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) when dosed \nwith osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. However, an in vitro signal of time-dependent \n\ninhibition has been observed, thus the consequence following repeated dosing is unclear. \n\nOsilodrostat should be used with caution when co-administered with sensitive CYP2C19 \n\nsubstrates with a narrow therapeutic index. \n\n- CYP1A2 –AUC geometric mean ratio of 2.5 for caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) when dosed with \nosilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. However, an in vitro signal of CYP1A2 induction \n\nhas been observed, thus the consequence following repeated dosing is unclear. Osilodrostat \n\nshould be used with caution when co-administered with sensitive CYP1A2 substrates with a \n\nnarrow therapeutic index such as theophylline and tizanidine. \n\n \n\nIn a healthy volunteer study (n=24), osilodrostat (30 mg twice daily for 7 days before concomitant \n\nadministration with a combined oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl oestradiol and 0.15 mg \n\nlevonorgestrel and continued for another 5 days) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the \n\nAUC and Cmax of ethinyl estradiol (geometric mean ratio: 1.03 and 0.88, respectively) and AUC of \n\nlevonorgestrel (geometric mean ratio: 1.02). The Cmax of levonorgestrel fell slightly outside the \n\nbioequivalence acceptance range (geometric mean ratio: 0.86; 90% confidence interval : 0.737-1.00). \n\nThe effects of a longer induction period and an interaction with other hormonal contraceptives have \n\nnot been studied (see also sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nIn vitro data \n\nIn vitro data for osilodrostat and its major metabolite M34.5 suggest a potential for both inhibition and \n\ninduction for CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5, a potential for time-dependent inhibition of \n\nCYP2C19, and an inhibitory potential for CYP2E1 and UGT1A1. It cannot be excluded that \n\nosilodrostat may affect the exposure of sensitive substrates for these enzymes. \n\n \n\nIn vitro data for osilodrostat and its major metabolite M34.5 suggest an inhibitory potential for \n\nOATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 and MATE1. It cannot be excluded that osilodrostat may \n\naffect the exposure of sensitive substrates for these transporters. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nBased on preclinical data, osilodrostat may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant \n\nwoman. A pregnancy test before initiating treatment is recommended in women of childbearing \n\npotential. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least \n\none week after treatment. If hormonal contraceptives other than the oral combination of \n\nethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel are used, an additional barrier method of contraception is \n\nrecommended (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of osilodrostat in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Isturisa should not be used during \n\npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether osilodrostat or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \n\nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \n\nIsturisa and for at least one week after treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere is no information on the effect of osilodrostat on human fertility. Animal studies have shown \n\neffects on the menstrual cycle and reduced female fertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nIsturisa may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \n\nwarned about the potential for dizziness and fatigue (see section 4.8) and should be advised not to \n\ndrive or use machines if these symptoms occur. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported in the pivotal phase III study with osilodrostat were \n\nadrenal insufficiency (51%), fatigue (44%), oedema (21%), vomiting (22%), nausea (42%) and \n\nheadache (34%). \n\n \n\nThe most serious adverse reaction associated with the use of osilodrostat is adrenal insufficiency (see \n\nalso sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse drug reactions (Table 1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ \n\nclass, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing \n\nseriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based \n\non the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse drug reactions \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency \n\ncategory \n\nPreferred term* \n\nEndocrine disorders Very common Adrenal insufficiency \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Very common Hypokalaemia, decreased appetite \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Dizziness, headache \n\nCommon Syncope \n\nCardiac disorders Common Tachycardia \n\nVascular disorders Very common Hypotension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Very common Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal \n\npain \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very common Rash \n\nCommon Hirsutism**, acne** \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nVery common Fatigue, oedema \n\nCommon Malaise \n\nInvestigations Very common Blood testosterone increased**, blood \n\ncorticotrophin increased \n\nCommon Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, \n\ntransaminases increased \n\n* Some terms denote grouped term of two or more MedDRA preferred terms that were \n\nconsidered clinically similar. The term “adrenal insufficiency” includes the terms \n\nglucocorticoid deficiency, adrenocortical insufficiency acute, steroid withdrawal syndrome, \n\nurine free cortisol decreased, cortisol decreased. \n\n** Frequency “very common” in female patients. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nCYP11B1 inhibition by osilodrostat is associated with adrenal steroid precursor accumulation and \n\ntestosterone increases. In a clinical study with osilodrostat, mean testosterone levels in female patients \n\nincreased from high normal at baseline to above the upper limit of the normal range. The increases \n\nreversed when treatment was interrupted. The testosterone increase was associated with mild to \n\nmoderate cases of hirsutism or acne in a subset of patients. \n\n \n\nACTH values above 10-fold upper limit of normal were observed in some Cushing’s disease patients \n\ntreated with osilodrostat in the clinical studies (see section 5.1) and may be associated with cortisol \n\nvalues below the lower limit of normal. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nOverdosage may result in severe hypocortisolism. Signs and symptoms suggestive of hypocortisolism \n\nmay include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, low blood pressure, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, dizziness \n\nand syncope. \n\n \n\nIn case of suspected overdosage, Isturisa should be interrupted, cortisol levels checked, and if \n\nnecessary corticosteroid supplementation initiated. Close surveillance may be necessary including \n\nmonitoring of the QT interval, blood pressure, glucose, fluid and electrolyte balance until the patient’s \n\ncondition is stable. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anticorticosteroids, ATC code: H02CA02 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nOsilodrostat is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor. It potently inhibits 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), the \n\nenzyme responsible for the final step of cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal gland. \n\n \n\nCYP11B1 inhibition is associated with the accumulation of precursors such as 11-deoxycortisol and \n\nacceleration of adrenal biosynthesis including androgens. In Cushing’s disease, the fall in plasma \n\ncortisol concentration also stimulates ACTH secretion, via the feedback mechanism which accelerates \n\nsteroid biosynthesis (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nIn a thorough QT study (n=86 male and female healthy volunteers) with osilodrostat, the maximum \n\nQTcF interval duration differences to placebo were 1.73 ms (90% CI: 0.15, 3.31) at the 10 mg dose \n\nand 25.38 ms (90% CI: 23.53, 27.22) at a supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg. Based on an interpolation \n\nof these results, the mean maximum prolongation at the highest recommended dose of 30 mg is \n\nestimated to be +5.3 ms. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of osilodrostat in patients with Cushing’s disease were evaluated in a \n\nprospective phase III study (study C2301) that used a randomised withdrawal design. The study \n\nconsisted of a 26-week open-label period of single-arm osilodrostat treatment, followed by an 8-week \n\nrandomised withdrawal period in which patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio to either osilodrostat or \n\nplacebo and a subsequent osilodrostat open-label period. \n\n \n\nThe eligibility criteria included Cushing’s disease (with confirmation of the pituitary source of excess \n\nadrenocorticotrophic hormone), and a mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC, derived from three 24-hour \n\nurine collections) value greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening. \n\n \n\nA total of 137 adult patients were enrolled. The mean age was 41.2 years, and the majority of patients \n\nwere female (77%). Seven patients were aged 65 years or older. Prior therapy included pituitary \n\nsurgery in 88% of patients and prior medical therapy in 75% of patients. The mean and median \n\nbaseline mUFC levels were 1006.0 nmol/24 h and 476.4 nmol/24 h, respectively \n\n(ULN: 138 nmol/24 h). Co-morbidities at baseline included hypertension (67.9% of patients), obesity \n\n(29.9%), diabetes mellitus (21.9%) and osteoporosis (27.7%). \n\n \n\nPatients received a starting dose of 2 mg osilodrostat twice daily and the dose could be up-titrated \n\nbased on individual response and tolerability during an initial 12-week period. Patients with no further \n\n\n\n10 \n\ndose increases during the following 12 weeks and with a mUFC ≤ULN at week 24 were randomised in \n\na 1:1 ratio at week 26 to receive either osilodrostat or matching placebo for 8 weeks (double-blind \n\nrandomised withdrawal period), followed by open-label osilodrostat for the remainder of the study. At \n\nweek 26, 71 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to continue receiving osilodrostat (n=36) or to \n\nswitch to placebo (n=35). Patients who were not eligible for randomisation at week 24 (n=47) \n\ncontinued on open-label osilodrostat treatment. \n\n \n\nThe primary objective was to compare the proportion of complete responders at week 34 (the end of \n\nthe 8-week randomised withdrawal period) between patients randomised to continued active treatment \n\nand placebo. For the primary endpoint, a complete response was defined as a mUFC value ≤ULN at \n\nweek 34. Patients whose dose was increased during the randomised withdrawal period or who \n\ndiscontinued randomised treatment were considered non-responders. The key secondary endpoint was \n\nthe complete response rate at week 24. Patients with dose increases between weeks 12 and 24 and \n\npatients with no valid mUFC assessment at week 24 were counted as non-responders for the key \n\nsecondary endpoint. \n\n \n\nThe study met its primary and key secondary endpoints (Table 2). \n\n \n\nMedian mUFC levels decreased to 62.5 nmol/24 h (-84.1% change from baseline, n=125) at week 12, \n\nto 75.5 nmol/24 h (-82.3%, n=125) at week 24 and to 63.3 nmol/24 h (-87.9%, n=108) at week 48. \n\n \n\nTable 2 Key results: Phase III study in Cushing’s disease patients (study C2301) \n \n\n \n\nOsilodrostat \n\nn=36 \n\nPlacebo \n\nn=34 \n\n \n\nPrimary endpoint: Proportion of \n\nresponders at the end of the \n\nrandomised withdrawal period \n\n(week 34) n (%) (95% CI) \n\n31 (86.1) \n\n(70.5, 95.3) \n\n10 (29.4) \n\n(15.1, 47.5) \n\n \n\nResponse rate difference (odds \n\nratio): osilodrostat vs. placebo \n\n13.7 (3.7, 53.4) \n\n2-sided p value <0.001 \n \n\nSecondary endpoints \n\nAll patients \n\nN=137 \n\nKey secondary endpoint: Proportion with mUFC ≤ULN at week 24 and \n\nno dose increase after week 12 (95% CI) \n\n72 (52.6%) \n\n(43.9, 61.1) \n\nComplete mUFC response rate (mUFC ≤ULN) at week 48 91 (66.4%) \n\n(57.9, 74.3) \n\nMedian mUFC value and percentage change at week 48 63.3 nmol/24 h (-87.9%) \n\nmUFC: mean urinary free cortisol; ULN: upper limit of normal; CI: confidence interval; response: \n\nmUFC ≤ULN. \n\n \n\nImprovements were observed in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters (Table 3) and 85.6% of \n\npatients with available assessments showed an improvement in at least one physical feature of \n\nCushing’s disease at week 48. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters \n \n\n Baseline Week 24 Week 48 \n\nSystolic blood pressure (mmHg) 132.2 124.9 (-4.1%) 121.7 (-6.8%) \n\nDiastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 85.3 81.0 (-3.8%) 78.9 (-6.6%) \n\nBody weight (kg) 80.8 77.3 (-3.0%) 75.5 (-4.6%) \n\nWaist circumference (cm) 103.4 99.1 (-2.6%) 97.4 (-4.2%) \n\nHbA1c (%) 6.0 5.6 (-4.6%) 5.6 (-5.4%) \n\n \n\nOsilodrostat treatment also resulted in an improvement in patient-reported outcomes. Improvements \n\nfrom baseline above the established minimal important difference (MID) were observed for Cushing’s \n\n\n\n11 \n\nQoL (total score, Physical Problems subscale and Psychosocial Issues subscale), EQ-5D Utility index \n\nand BDI-II (depression) scores. The mean Cushing QoL total score improved from 42.2 at baseline to \n\n58.3 (+14.1; +52.4% change from baseline) at week 48. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of osilodrostat was also assessed in study C1201 in nine adult Japanese patients with \n\nnon-pituitary causes of Cushing’s syndrome. The study enrolled patients with adrenal adenoma (n=5), \n\nectopic corticotropin syndrome (n=3) and ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia \n\n(n=1), and consisted of a 12-week dose titration period (starting dose 2 mg twice daily), a 36-week \n\nmaintenance period and an optional long-term extension. At week 12 (primary endpoint) a complete \n\nresponse (mUFC ≤ULN) was observed in 6 patients (66.7%) and a partial response (mUFC decrease \n\nby at least 50%) in one additional patient (11.1%). The median average dose used in the study was \n\n2.6 mg/day (range 1.3-7.5 mg/day). The mean duration of treatment in this study was 24 weeks, and \n\nlong-term exposure was limited. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nIsturisa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in adrenal cortical hyperfunction (see \n\nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nOsilodrostat is a highly soluble, highly permeable compound (BCS class 1). It is rapidly absorbed (tmax \n\n~1 h) and oral absorption in humans is assumed to be nearly complete. Steady state is reached by \n\nday 2. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with food did not affect absorption to a clinically significant extent. In a healthy \n\nvolunteer study (n=20), the administration of a single dose of 30 mg osilodrostat with a high-fat meal \n\nresulted in a modest reduction of AUC and Cmax by 11% and 21%, respectively, and the median tmax \n\nwas delayed from 1 to 2.5 hours. \n\n \n\nNo clinically relevant accumulation was observed in clinical studies. An accumulation ratio of 1.3 was \n\nestimated for the 2 to 30 mg dose range. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe median apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of osilodrostat is approximately 100 litres. Protein \n\nbinding of osilodrostat and of its major metabolite M34.5 is low (less than 40%) and \n\nconcentration-independent. The osilodrostat blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.85. \n\n \n\nOsilodrostat is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 transporters. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn a human ADME study in healthy subjects following the administration of a single dose of 50 mg \n\n[14C]-osilodrostat, metabolism was deemed the most important clearance pathway for osilodrostat \n\nsince ~80% of the dose was excreted as metabolites. The three main metabolites in plasma (M34.5, \n\nM16.5 and M24.9) represented 51%, 9% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Both M34.5 and M24.9 \n\nhave longer half-lives than osilodrostat and some accumulation is expected with twice-daily dosing. \n\nThe decrease in the contribution of osilodrostat to the radioactivity AUC with time post-dose was \n\nfound to coincide closely with a corresponding increase in the contribution of M34.5. \n\n \n\nThirteen metabolites were characterised in the urine, with the three main metabolites being M16.5, \n\nM22 (an M34.5 glucuronide) and M24.9, with 17, 13 and 11% of the dose, respectively. The \n\nformation of the major urinary metabolite M16.5 (direct N-glucuronide) was catalysed by UGT1A4, \n\n\n\n12 \n\n2B7 and 2B10. Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as M34.5 (di-oxygenated osilodrostat) in the \n\nurine but 13% of the dose was identified as M22 (M34.5-glucuronide). The formation of M34.5 was \n\nnon-CYP-mediated. \n\n \n\nMultiple CYP enzymes and UDP glucuronosyltransferases contribute to osilodrostat metabolism and \n\nno single enzyme contributes more than 25% to the total clearance. The main CYP enzymes involved \n\nin osilodrostat metabolism are CYP3A4, 2B6 and 2D6. Total CYP contribution is 26%, total UGT \n\ncontribution is 19% and non-CYP non-UGT mediated metabolism was shown to contribute to ~50% \n\nof total clearance. In addition, osilodrostat showed a high intrinsic permeability, low efflux ratio and \n\nmodest impact of inhibitors on the efflux ratio in vitro. This suggests that the potential for clinical \n\ndrug-drug interactions (DDI) with concomitantly administered medicinal products that inhibit \n\ntransporters or a single CYP or UGT enzyme is low. \n\n \n\nIn vitro data indicate that the metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacological effect of \n\nosilodrostat. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nThe elimination half-life of osilodrostat is approximately 4 hours. \n\n \n\nIn an ADME study, the majority (91%) of the radioactive dose of osilodrostat was eliminated in the \n\nurine, with only a minor amount eliminated in the faeces (1.6% of dose). The low percentage of the \n\ndose eliminated in the urine as unchanged osilodrostat (5.2%) indicates that metabolism is the major \n\nclearance pathway in humans. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nExposure (AUCinf and Cmax) increased more than dose-proportionally over the therapeutic dose range. \n\n \n\nDrug-drug interactions (see also section 4.5) \n\n \n\nIn vitro data indicate that neither osilodrostat nor its major metabolite M34.5 inhibits the following \n\nenzymes and transporters at clinically relevant concentrations: CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \n\nUGT2B7, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B3 and MATE2-K. Since the exposure of M34.5 has \n\nnot yet been determined after repeated dosing, the clinical relevance of the in vitro drug-drug \n\ninteraction results for M34.5 is unknown. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn a phase I study in 33 subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function using a single dose of 30 mg \n\nosilodrostat, AUCinf was 1.4- and 2.7-fold higher in the moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe \n\n(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment cohorts, respectively. Cmax was 15 and 20% lower in the moderate \n\nand severe cohorts. The terminal half-life increased to 9.3 hours and 19.5 hours in the moderate and \n\nsevere cohorts. Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) did not influence exposure to any significant \n\nextent. The absorption rate was not affected by the degree of hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn a phase I study in 15 subjects with varying degrees of renal function using a single dose of 30 mg \n\nosilodrostat, comparable systemic exposure was seen in subjects with severe renal impairment, \n\nend-stage renal disease and normal renal function. \n\n \n\nRace/ethnicity and bodyweight \n\nThe relative bioavailability was approximately 20% higher in Asian patients compared to other \n\nethnicities. Body weight was not shown to be a major determinant of this difference. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nAge and gender \n\nAge and gender had no significant impact on osilodrostat exposure in adults. The number of elderly \n\npatients in clinical studies was limited (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nRepeat dose toxicity \n\n \n\nIn repeat dose toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats and dogs, the central nervous system, liver, \n\nfemale reproductive organs, and the adrenal gland were the primary target organs. The NOAEL for \n\nhepatic, reproductive organ and adrenal effects in long-term (26- and 39-week) studies was at least \n\nfour-fold human clinical exposure based on AUC. CNS findings (aggression, hypersensitivity to touch \n\nand increased or decreased activity) were noted in the rat, mouse and dog. The NOAEL for the CNS \n\neffects was approximately 2-fold human free Cmax based on the most sensitive species. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity \n\n \n\nGenotoxicity assays conducted in vitro in bacterial systems and in vitro and in vivo in mammalian \n\nsystems with and without metabolic activation do not indicate a relevant risk in humans. In rat and \n\nmice carcinogenicity studies, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (at lower \n\ndoses in males than females), and neoplastic changes of thyroid follicular adenoma/carcinoma (in male \n\nrats only) were observed. The findings are likely rodent specific and considered not relevant to \n\nhumans. \n\n \n\nFertility and reproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nReproductive studies in rabbits and rats demonstrated embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity (increased \n\nresorptions and decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal weights, external malformations, and \n\nvisceral and skeletal variations) and teratogenicity at maternally toxic doses. The NOAEL was 10-fold \n\nhuman exposure (AUC) in a pre- and postnatal developmental study, and 8- to 73-fold human \n\nexposure (AUC) in a rat fertility and early embryonic development study. The maternal and foetal \n\nNOAEL in the rabbit embryofoetal development study was 0.6-fold human exposure (AUC). \n\n \n\nJuvenile toxicity \n\n \n\nThe findings in juvenile rat toxicity studies were largely consistent with those observed in adult rat \n\nstudies. Delayed sexual maturation was noted at high doses with no effects on overall reproductive \n\nperformance or parameters after a 6-week recovery period. There were no effects on long bone growth \n\nor behavioural performance. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What Isturisa is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat Isturisa is \nIsturisa is a medicine that contains the active substance osilodrostat. \n\n \n\nWhat Isturisa is used for \nIsturisa is used in adults to treat endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, a condition in which the body \n\nproduces too much of a hormone called cortisol. Too much cortisol may lead to a variety of symptoms \n\nsuch as weight gain (particularly around the waist), a moon-shaped face, bruising easily, irregular \n\nperiods, excessive body and facial hair, and generally feeling weak, tired or unwell. \n\n \n\nHow Isturisa works \nIsturisa blocks the main enzyme that makes cortisol in the adrenal glands. The effect of this is to \n\ndecrease the over-production of cortisol and improve the symptoms of endogenous Cushing’s \n\nsyndrome. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Isturisa \n \n\nDo not take Isturisa: \n- if you are allergic to osilodrostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Isturisa. \n\n \n\nIf any of the following apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Isturisa: \n\n- if you have a heart disorder or a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat, including \n\n\n\n31 \n\na condition called prolonged QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation). \n\n- if you have a liver disease; your doctor may need to change your dose of Isturisa. \n \n\nContact your doctor immediately if you have two or more of these symptoms during your treatment \n\nwith Isturisa. This may indicate that you have adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol levels): \n\n- weakness \n- light-headedness \n- tiredness \n- lack of appetite \n- nausea (feeling sick) \n- vomiting \n \n\nTests before and during treatment \nYour doctor will test your blood and/or urine before you start treatment and regularly during \n\ntreatment. This is to detect any possible abnormalities in your magnesium, calcium and potassium \n\nlevels and also to measure the levels of cortisol. Depending on the results, your doctor may change \n\nyour dose. \n\n \n\nThis medicine may have an unwanted effect (called QT prolongation) on the function of the heart. \n\nYour doctor will therefore also check for this effect by performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) before \n\nyou start treatment and during treatment. \n\n \n\nIf your Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a benign tumour (called adenoma) in the pituitary gland, \n\nyour doctor may consider stopping your treatment if a pituitary scan shows that the adenoma has \n\nexpanded into neighbouring regions. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is not recommended for patients aged under 18 years. This is because there is a lack of \n\ndata in these patients. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Isturisa \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is \n\nparticularly important that you mention any of the following medicines: \n\n- medicines that may have an unwanted effect (called QT prolongation) on the function of the \nheart. These include medicines used for abnormal heart rhythm such as quinidine, sotalol and \n\namiodarone; medicines used for allergies (antihistamines); antidepressants such as amitriptyline \n\nand drugs for mental health disorders (antipsychotics); antibiotics, including the following \n\ntypes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole; and other medicines for Cushing’s disease \n\n(pasireotide, ketoconazole) \n\n- theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) or tizanidine (used to treat muscle pain and \nmuscle cramps) \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nThis medicine should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless your doctor has advised \n\nyou to do so. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have \n\na baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nContraception \n\nWomen who could become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception during treatment \n\nand for at least one week after the last dose. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before \n\nyou start taking Isturisa. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nDizziness and tiredness may occur during treatment with Isturisa. Do not drive or operate machines if \n\nyou get these symptoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n3. How to take Isturisa \n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n \n\nThe usual starting dose is two 1 mg tablets twice a day (about every 12 hours). Patients of Asian \n\nancestry and patients with liver disease may need a lower starting dose (one 1 mg tablet twice a day). \n\n \n\nAfter you have started treatment, your doctor may change your dose. This will depend on how you \n\nrespond to the treatment. The highest recommended dose is 30 mg twice a day. \n\n \n\nIsturisa tablets are taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Isturisa than you should \nIf you have taken more Isturisa than you should and you feel unwell (for example if you feel weak, \n\nlight-headed, tired or sick, or if you have to vomit), or if someone else accidentally takes your \n\nmedicine, contact a doctor or hospital for advice immediately. Medical treatment may be needed. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Isturisa \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, just wait until it is time for your \n\nnext dose and take that at the scheduled time. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Isturisa \nDo not stop taking Isturisa unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment with Isturisa, \n\nyour symptoms may come back. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSome side effects may be serious. Please take particular note of the following: \n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you experience a heart disorder or heart rhythm disorder, such \nas a fast and irregular heartbeat, even when you are at rest, heart palpitations, blackouts or \n\nfainting (this could be a sign of a condition called QT prolongation, a side effect that may affect \n\nup to 1 in 10 people). \n\n- Tell your doctor immediately if you have two or more of these symptoms: weakness, \nlight-headedness, tiredness (fatigue), lack of appetite, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting. This may \n\nindicate that you have adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol levels), a side effect that may affect \n\nmore than 1 in 10 people. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when Isturisa lowers the amount of \n\ncortisol too much. It is more likely to occur during periods of increased stress. Your doctor will \n\ncorrect this by using a hormone medicine or by adjusting the dose of Isturisa. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n- vomiting \n- nausea (feeling sick) \n- diarrhoea \n- abdominal pain \n- tiredness (fatigue) \n- build-up of fluid leading to swelling (oedema), particularly of your ankles \n- abnormal blood tests (increased levels of testosterone, increased levels of adrenocorticotrophic \n\nhormone, also known as ACTH, low levels of potassium) \n\n- decreased appetite \n- dizziness \n- headache \n- rash \n- low blood pressure (hypotension) \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n- fast heartbeat (tachycardia) \n- general feeling of being unwell (malaise) \n- abnormal results of liver function tests \n- fainting (syncope) \n- excessive facial or body hair growth (hirsutism) \n- acne \n \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Isturisa \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the blister after \n\nEXP.
