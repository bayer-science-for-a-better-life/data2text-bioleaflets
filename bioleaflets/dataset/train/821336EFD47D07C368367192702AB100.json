NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nErbitux 5 mg/mL solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach mL of solution for infusion contains 5 mg cetuximab. \n\nEach vial of 20 mL contains 100 mg cetuximab.\nEach vial of 100 mL contains 500 mg cetuximab.\n\nCetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody produced in a mammalian cell line (Sp2/0) by \nrecombinant DNA technology. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for infusion.\n\nColourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nErbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-\nexpressing, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer\n\uf0b7 in combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy,\n\uf0b7 in first-line in combination with FOLFOX,\n\uf0b7 as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and who \n\nare intolerant to irinotecan.\nFor details, see section 5.1.\n\nErbitux is indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck\n\uf0b7 in combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease,\n\uf0b7 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nErbitux must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \nantineoplastic medicinal products. Close monitoring is required during the infusion and for at least \n1 hour after the end of the infusion. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured.\n\nPosology\n\nPrior to the first infusion, patients must receive premedication with an antihistamine and a \ncorticosteroid at least 1 hour prior to administration of cetuximab. This premedication is recommended \nprior to all subsequent infusions.\n\nIn all indications, Erbitux is administered once a week. The initial dose is 400 mg cetuximab per m2\n\nbody surface area. All subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg cetuximab per m2 each.\n\n\n\n3\n\nColorectal cancer\n\nIn patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, cetuximab is used in combination with chemotherapy or \nas a single agent (see section 5.1). Evidence of wild-type RAS (KRAS and NRAS) status is required \nbefore initiating treatment with Erbitux. Mutational status should be determined by an experienced \nlaboratory using validated test methods for detection of KRAS and NRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4) \nmutations (see section 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nFor the dosage or recommended dose modifications of concomitantly used chemotherapeutic agents, \nrefer to the product information for these medicinal products. They must not be administered earlier \nthan 1 hour after the end of the cetuximab infusion.\n\nIt is recommended that cetuximab treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease.\n\nSquamous cell cancer of the head and neck\n\nIn patients with locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, cetuximab is used \nconcomitantly with radiation therapy. It is recommended to start cetuximab therapy one week before \nradiation therapy and to continue cetuximab therapy until the end of the radiation therapy period.\n\nIn patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, cetuximab is \nused in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by cetuximab as maintenance \ntherapy until disease progression (see section 5.1). Chemotherapy must not be administered earlier \nthan 1 hour after the end of the cetuximab infusion.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nOnly patients with adequate renal and hepatic function have been investigated to date (see section 4.4).\n\nCetuximab has not been studied in patients with pre-existing haematological disorders (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nNo dose adjustment is required in older people, but the experience is limited in patients 75 years of\nage and above.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThere is no relevant use of cetuximab in the paediatric population in the granted indications.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nErbitux 5 mg/mL is administered intravenously with an infusion pump, gravity drip or a syringe pump \n(for handling instructions, see section 6.6).\n\nThe initial dose should be given slowly and speed of infusion must not exceed 5 mg/min (see \nsection 4.4). The recommended infusion period is 120 minutes. For the subsequent weekly doses, the \nrecommended infusion period is 60 minutes. The infusion rate must not exceed 10 mg/min.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nErbitux is contraindicated in patients with known severe (grade 3 or 4) hypersensitivity reactions to \ncetuximab.\n\nThe combination of Erbitux with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy is contraindicated for patients \nwith mutant RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) or for whom RAS mCRC status is unknown \n(see also section 4.4).\n\n\n\n4\n\nBefore initiation of combination treatment, contraindications for concomitantly used chemotherapeutic \nagents or radiation therapy must be considered.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nInfusion-related, including anaphylactic, reactions\n\nSevere infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may commonly occur, in some \ncases with fatal outcome. Occurrence of a severe infusion-related reaction requires immediate and \npermanent discontinuation of cetuximab therapy and may necessitate emergency treatment. Some of \nthese reactions may be anaphylactic or anaphylactoid in nature or represent a cytokine release \nsyndrome (CRS). Symptoms may occur during the first infusion and for up to several hours afterwards \nor with subsequent infusions. It is recommended to warn patients of the possibility of such a late onset \nand instruct them to contact their physician if symptoms or signs of an infusion-related reaction occur. \nSymptoms may include bronchospasm, urticaria, increase or decrease in blood pressure, loss of \nconsciousness or shock. In rare cases, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest have \nbeen observed. \n\nAnaphylactic reactions may occur as early as within a few minutes of the first infusion e.g. due to \npreformed IgE antibodies cross-reacting with cetuximab. These reactions are commonly associated \nwith bronchospasm and urticaria. They can occur despite the use of premedication.\nThe risk for anaphylactic reactions is much increased in patients with a history of allergy to red meat \nor tick bites or positive results of tests for IgE antibodies against cetuximab (\u03b1-1-3-galactose). In these \npatients cetuximab should be administered only after a careful assessment of benefit/risk, including \nalternative treatments, and only under close supervision of well trained personnel with resuscitation \nequipment ready. \n\nThe first dose should be administered slowly and the speed must not exceed 5 mg/min whilst all vital \nsigns are closely monitored for at least two hours. If during the first infusion, an infusion-related \nreaction occurs within the first 15 minutes, the infusion should be stopped. A careful benefit/risk \nassessment should be undertaken including consideration whether the patient may have preformed IgE \nantibodies before a subsequent infusion is given. \n\nIf an infusion-related reaction develops later during the infusion or at a subsequent infusion further \nmanagement will depend on its severity:\n\na) Grade 1: continue slow infusion under close supervision\n\nb) Grade 2: continue slow infusion and immediately administer treatment for symptoms\n\nc) Grade 3 and 4: stop infusion immediately, treat symptoms vigorously and contraindicate further \nuse of cetuximab\n\nA cytokine release syndrome (CRS) typically occurs within one hour after infusion and is less \ncommonly associated with bronchospasm and urticaria. CRS is normally most severe in relation to the \nfirst infusion.\n\nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions are very common comprising symptoms such as fever, \nchills, dizziness, or dyspnoea that occur in a close temporal relationship mainly to the first cetuximab \ninfusion. If the patient experiences a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate may \nbe decreased. It is recommended to maintain this lower infusion rate in all subsequent infusions.\n\nA close monitoring of patients, particularly during the first administration, is required. Special \nattention is recommended for patients with reduced performance status and pre-existing cardio-\npulmonary disease.\n\n\n\n5\n\nRespiratory disorders\n\nCases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatal cases, have been reported, with the majority of \npatients from the Japanese population.\nConfounding or contributing factors, such as concomitant chemotherapy known to be associated with \nILD, and pre-existing pulmonary diseases were frequent in fatal cases. Such patients should be closely \nmonitored. In the event of symptoms (such as dyspnoea, cough, fever) or radiographic findings \nsuggestive of ILD, prompt diagnostic investigation should occur.\nIf interstitial lung disease is diagnosed, cetuximab must be discontinued and the patient be treated \nappropriately.\n\nSkin reactions\n\nMain adverse reactions of cetuximab are skin reactions which may become severe, especially in \ncombination with chemotherapy. The risk for secondary infections (mainly bacterial) is increased and \ncases of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, necrotising fasciitis and sepsis, in some cases with \nfatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8).\n\nSkin reactions are very common and treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required. \nAccording to clinical practice guidelines prophylactic use of oral tetracyclines (6 - 8 weeks) and \ntopical application of 1% hydrocortisone cream with moisturiser should be considered. Medium to \nhigh-potency topical corticosteroids or oral tetracyclines have been used for the treatment of skin \nreactions.\n\nIf a patient experiences an intolerable or severe skin reaction (\uf0b3 grade 3; Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE), cetuximab therapy must be interrupted. Treatment may only be \nresumed if the reaction has resolved to grade 2.\n\nIf the severe skin reaction occurred for the first time, treatment may be resumed without any change in \ndose level.\n\nWith the second and third occurrences of severe skin reactions, cetuximab therapy must again be\ninterrupted. Treatment may only be resumed at a lower dose level (200 mg/m\u00b2 after the second \noccurrence and 150 mg/m\u00b2 after the third occurrence), if the reaction has resolved to grade 2.\n\nIf severe skin reactions occur a fourth time or do not resolve to grade 2 during interruption of \ntreatment, permanent discontinuation of cetuximab treatment is required.\n\nElectrolyte disturbances\n\nProgressively decreasing serum magnesium levels occur frequently and may lead to severe \nhypomagnesaemia. Hypomagnesaemia is reversible following discontinuation of cetuximab. In \naddition, hypokalaemia may develop as a consequence of diarrhoea. Hypocalcaemia may also occur; \nin particular in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy the frequency of severe \nhypocalcaemia may be increased.\n\nDetermination of serum electrolyte levels is recommended prior to and periodically during cetuximab \ntreatment. Electrolyte repletion is recommended, as appropriate.\n\nNeutropenia and related infectious complications\n\nPatients who receive cetuximab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy are at an increased \nrisk for the occurrence of severe neutropenia, which may lead to subsequent infectious complications \nsuch as febrile neutropenia, pneumonia or sepsis. Careful monitoring is recommended in such patients, \nin particular in those who experience skin lesions, mucositis or diarrhoea that may facilitate the \noccurrence of infections (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n6\n\nCardiovascular disorders\n\nAn increased frequency of severe and sometimes fatal cardiovascular events and treatment emergent \ndeaths has been observed in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of \nthe head and neck and colorectal carcinoma. In some studies association with age \u2265 65 years or \nperformance status has been observed. When prescribing cetuximab, the cardiovascular and \nperformance status of the patients and concomitant administration of cardiotoxic compounds such as \nfluoropyrimidines should be taken into account.\n\nEye disorders\n\nPatients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or worsening: eye \ninflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred \npromptly to an ophthalmology specialist.\n\nIf a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with cetuximab should be interrupted or \ndiscontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be \ncarefully considered.\n\nCetuximab should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or \nsevere dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration.\n\nColorectal cancer patients with RAS mutated tumours\n\nCetuximab should not be used in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients whose tumours have RAS \nmutations or for whom RAS tumour status is unknown. Results from clinical studies show a negative \nbenefit-risk balance in tumours with RAS mutations. In particular, in these patients negative effects on \nprogression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were seen as add-on to FOLFOX4 (see \nsection 5.1). \n\nSimilar findings were also reported when cetuximab was given as add-on to XELOX in combination \nwith bevacizumab (CAIRO2). However, in this study no positive effects on PFS or OS were \ndemonstrated in patients with KRAS wild-type tumours, either.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nOnly patients with adequate renal and hepatic function have been investigated to date (serum \ncreatinine \uf0a3 1.5fold, transaminases \uf0a3 5fold and bilirubin \uf0a3 1.5fold the upper limit of normal).\n\nCetuximab has not been studied in patients presenting with one or more of the following laboratory \nparameters:\n\uf0b7 haemoglobin < 9 g/dL\n\uf0b7 leukocyte count < 3000/mm\u00b3\n\uf0b7 absolute neutrophil count < 1500/mm\u00b3\n\uf0b7 platelet count < 100000/mm\u00b3\n\nThere is limited experience in the use of cetuximab in combination with radiation therapy in colorectal \ncancer.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe efficacy of cetuximab in paediatric patients below the age of 18 years has not been established. \nNo new safety signals were identified in paediatric patients as reported from a phase-I study.\n\n\n\n7\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nIn combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, the frequency of severe leukopenia or severe \nneutropenia may be increased, and thus may lead to a higher rate of infectious complications such as \nfebrile neutropenia, pneumonia and sepsis compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIn combination with fluoropyrimidines, the frequency of cardiac ischaemia including myocardial \ninfarction and congestive heart failure as well as the frequency of hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia) were increased compared to that with fluoropyrimidines.\n\nIn combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) the frequency of severe diarrhoea may be \nincreased.\n\nA formal interaction study showed that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of cetuximab remain \nunaltered after co-administration of a single dose of irinotecan (350 mg/m2 body surface area). \nSimilarly, the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan were unchanged when cetuximab was co-administered.\n\nNo other formal interaction studies with cetuximab have been performed in humans.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nEGFR is involved in foetal development. Limited observations in animals are indicative of a placental \ntransfer of cetuximab, and other IgG1 antibodies have been found to cross the placental barrier. Animal \ndata revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. However, dependent on the dose, an increased incidence \nof abortion was observed (see section 5.3). Sufficient data from pregnant or lactating women are not \navailable.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that Erbitux be given during pregnancy or to any woman not employing \nadequate contraception only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies a potential risk to the \nfoetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is recommended that women do not breast-feed during treatment with Erbitux and for 2 months after \nthe last dose, because it is not known whether cetuximab is excreted in breast milk. \n\nFertility\n\nThere are no data on the effect of cetuximab on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility \nhave not been evaluated within formal animal studies (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. If patients \nexperience treatment-related symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is \nrecommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nThe main undesirable effects of cetuximab are skin reactions, which occur in more than 80% of \npatients, hypomagnesaemia which occurs in more than 10% of patients and infusion-related reactions, \nwhich occur with mild to moderate symptoms in more than 10% of patients and with severe symptoms \nin more than 1% of patients.\n\n\n\n8\n\nThe following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter:\n\nVery common (\uf0b3 1/10)\nCommon (\uf0b3 1/100 to < 1/10)\nUncommon (\uf0b3 1/1,000 to < 1/100)\nRare (\uf0b3 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)\nVery rare (< 1/10,000)\nFrequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\nAn asterisk (*) indicates that additional information on the respective undesirable effect is provided \nbelow the table.\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\nVery common: Hypomagnesaemia (see section 4.4).\nCommon: Dehydration, in particular secondary to diarrhoea or mucositis; hypocalcaemia \n\n(see section 4.4); anorexia which may lead to weight decrease.\n\nNervous system disorders\n\nCommon: Headache.\nFrequency not known: Aseptic meningitis.\n\nEye disorders\n\nCommon: Conjunctivitis.\nUncommon: Blepharitis; keratitis.\n\nVascular disorders\n\nUncommon: Deep vein thrombosis.\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\n\nUncommon: Pulmonary embolism; interstitial lung disease, which may be fatal (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nCommon: Diarrhoea; nausea; vomiting.\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\n\nVery common: Increase in liver enzyme levels (ASAT, ALAT, AP).\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\nVery common: Skin reactions*.\nVery rare: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.\nFrequency not known:Superinfection of skin lesions*.\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions\n\nVery common: Mild or moderate infusion-related reactions (see section 4.4); mucositis, in \nsome cases severe. Mucositis may lead to epistaxis.\n\nCommon: Severe infusion-related reactions, in some cases with fatal outcome \n(see section 4.4); fatigue.\n\n\n\n9\n\nAdditional information\n\nOverall, no clinically relevant difference between genders was observed.\n\nSkin reactions\n\nSkin reactions may develop in more than 80% of patients and mainly present as acne-like rash and/or, \nless frequently, as pruritus, dry skin, desquamation, hypertrichosis, or nail disorders (e.g. paronychia). \nApproximately 15% of the skin reactions are severe, including single cases of skin necrosis. The \nmajority of skin reactions develop within the first three weeks of therapy. They generally resolve, \nwithout sequelae, over time following cessation of treatment if the recommended adjustments in dose \nregimen are followed (see section 4.4).\nSkin lesions induced by cetuximab may predispose patients to superinfections (e.g. with S. aureus), \nwhich may lead to subsequent complications, e.g. cellulitis, erysipelas, or, potentially with fatal \noutcome, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, necrotising fasciitis or sepsis.\n\nCombination treatment\n\nWhen cetuximab is used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, also refer to their respective \nproduct information.\n\nIn combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, the frequency of severe leukopenia or severe \nneutropenia may be increased, and thus may lead to a higher rate of infectious complications such as \nfebrile neutropenia, pneumonia and sepsis compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIn combination with fluoropyrimidines, the frequency of cardiac ischaemia including myocardial \ninfarction and congestive heart failure as well as the frequency of hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar \nerythrodysaesthesia) were increased compared to that with fluoropyrimidines.\n\nIn combination with local radiation therapy of the head and neck area, additional undesirable effects \nwere those typical of radiation therapy (such as mucositis, radiation dermatitis, dysphagia or \nleukopenia, mainly presenting as lymphocytopenia). In a randomised controlled clinical study with \n424 patients, reporting rates of severe acute radiation dermatitis and mucositis as well as of late \nradiation-therapy-related events were slightly higher in patients receiving radiation therapy in \ncombination with cetuximab than in those receiving radiation therapy alone.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited experience with single doses higher than 400 mg/m2 body surface area to date or \nweekly administrations of doses higher than 250 mg/m2 body surface area. In clinical studies with \ndoses up to 700 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks the safety profile was consistent with that described in \nsection 4.8.\n\n\n\n10\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC06\n\nMechanism of action\n\nCetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is specifically directed against the epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR).\n\nEGFR signalling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell cycle progression,\nangiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion/metastasis.\n\nCetuximab binds to the EGFR with an affinity that is approximately 5- to 10-fold higher than that of \nendogenous ligands. Cetuximab blocks binding of endogenous EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition of \nthe function of the receptor. It further induces the internalisation of EGFR, which can lead to down-\nregulation of EGFR. Cetuximab also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR-\nexpressing tumour cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC).\n\nCetuximab does not bind to other receptors belonging to the HER family.\n\nThe protein product of the proto-oncogene RAS (rat sarcoma) is a central down-stream signal-\ntransducer of EGFR. In tumours, activation of RAS by EGFR contributes to EGFR-mediated \nincreased proliferation, survival and the production of pro-angiogenic factors.\n\nRAS is one of the most frequently activated family of oncogenes in human cancers. Mutations of RAS \ngenes at certain hot-spots on exons 2, 3 and 4 result in constitutive activation of RAS proteins\nindependently of EGFR signalling.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\n\nIn both in vitro and in vivo assays, cetuximab inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of human \ntumour cells that express EGFR. In vitro cetuximab inhibits the production of angiogenic factors by \ntumour cells and blocks endothelial cell migration. In vivo cetuximab inhibits expression of angiogenic \nfactors by tumour cells and causes a reduction in tumour neo-vascularisation and metastasis.\n\nImmunogenicity\n\nThe development of human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACA) is a class effect of monoclonal chimeric \nantibodies. Current data on the development of HACAs is limited. Overall, measurable HACA titres \nwere noted in 3.4% of the patients studied, with incidences ranging from 0% to 9.6% in the target \nindication studies. No conclusive data on the neutralising effect of HACAs on cetuximab is available \nto date. The appearance of HACA did not correlate with the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions \nor any other undesirable effect to cetuximab.\n\nColorectal cancer\n\nA diagnostic assay (EGFR pharmDx) was used for immunohistochemical detection of EGFR \nexpression in tumour material. A tumour was considered to be EGFR-expressing, if one stained cell \ncould be identified. Approximately 75% of the patients with metastatic colorectal cancer screened for \nclinical studies had an EGFR-expressing tumour and were therefore considered eligible for cetuximab \ntreatment. The efficacy and safety of cetuximab have not been documented in patients with tumours \nwhere EGFR was not detected.\n\n\n\n11\n\nStudy data demonstrate that patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and activating RAS mutations \nare highly unlikely to benefit from treatment with cetuximab or a combination of cetuximab and \nchemotherapy and as add-on to FOLFOX4 a significant negative effect on progression-free survival \ntime (PFS) was shown. \n\nCetuximab as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy was investigated in 5 randomised \ncontrolled clinical studies and several supportive studies. The 5 randomised studies investigated a total \nof 3734 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, in whom EGFR expression was detectable and who \nhad an ECOG performance status of \u2264 2. The majority of patients included had an ECOG performance \nstatus of \u2264 1. In all studies, cetuximab was administered as described in section 4.2.\n\nThe KRAS exon 2 status was recognised as predictive factor for the treatment with cetuximab in 4 of \nthe randomised controlled studies (EMR 62 202-013, EMR 62 202-047, CA225006, and CA225025). \nKRAS mutational status was available for 2072 patients. Further post-hoc analyses were performed for \nstudies EMR 62 202-013 and EMR 62 202-047, where also mutations on RAS genes (NRAS and \nKRAS) other than KRAS exon 2 have been determined. Only in study EMR 62 202-007, a post-hoc \nanalysis was not possible.\n\nIn addition, cetuximab was investigated in combination with chemotherapy in an investigator-initiated \nrandomised controlled phase-III study (COIN, COntinuous chemotherapy plus cetuximab or \nINtermittent chemotherapy). In this study EGFR expression was not an inclusion criterion. Tumour \nsamples from approximately 81% of patients were analysed retrospectively for KRAS expression.\n\nFIRE-3, an investigator-sponsored clinical phase-III study, compared the treatment of FOLFIRI in \ncombination with either cetuximab or bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS \nexon 2 wild-type mCRC. Further post-hoc analyses on mutations on RAS genes other than KRAS \nexon 2 have been evaluated.\n\nCetuximab in combination with chemotherapy\n\n\uf0b7 EMR 62 202-013: This randomised study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had \nnot received prior treatment for metastatic disease compared the combination of cetuximab and \nirinotecan plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI) (599 patients) to the same \nchemotherapy alone (599 patients). The proportion of patients with KRAS wild-type tumours \nfrom the patient population evaluable for KRAS status comprised 63%. For the assessment of \nthe RAS status, mutations other than those on exon 2 of the KRAS gene were determined from \nall evaluable tumour samples within the KRAS exon 2 wild-type population (65%).

The third experimental arm used an intermittent OxMdG or XELOX regimen \nwithout cetuximab. Data for the XELOX regimen and the third experimental arm are not \npresented.\n\nTumour samples from approximately 81% of patients were analysed retrospectively for KRAS \nexpression, of which 55% were KRAS wild-type. Of these, 362 patients received cetuximab \nand oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines (117 patients OxMdG and 245 patients XELOX) and \n367 patients received oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines alone (127 patients OxMdG and \n240 patients XELOX).

Following disease progression, treatment with EGFR-targeting agents was \ninitiated in 50% of patients in the irinotecan-alone arm.\n\nIn the overall population, irrespective of KRAS status, the results reported for cetuximab plus \nirinotecan (648 patients) vs. irinotecan alone (650 patients) were: median overall survival time \n(OS) 10.71 vs. 9.99 months (HR 0.98), median progression free survival time (PFS) 4.0 vs. \n2.6 months (HR 0.69), and objective response rate (ORR) 16.4% vs. 4.2%.\n\nWith respect to the KRAS status, tumour samples were only available from 23% of the patients \n(300 of 1298). From the KRAS evaluated population 64% of the patients (192) had KRAS wild-\ntype tumours and 108 patients KRAS mutations. On the basis of this data and since no \nindependent review of imaging data was conducted, results in relation to mutation status are \nconsidered non-interpretable.\n\n\n\n15\n\n\uf0b7 EMR 62 202-007: This randomised study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after \nfailure of irinotecan-based treatment for metastatic disease as the last treatment before study \nentry compared the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan (218 patients) with cetuximab \nmonotherapy (111 patients). \n\nThe combination of cetuximab with irinotecan compared to cetuximab alone reduced the overall \nrisk of disease progression by 46% and significantly increased objective response rate. In the \nrandomised trial, the improvement in overall survival time did not reach statistical significance; \nhowever, in the follow-up treatment, nearly 50% of the patients of the cetuximab alone arm \nreceived a combination of cetuximab and irinotecan after progression of disease, which may \nhave influenced overall survival time.\n\nCetuximab as a single agent\n\n\uf0b7 CA225025: This randomised study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had \nreceived prior oxaliplatin-, irinotecan- and fluoropyrimidine-based treatment for metastatic \ndisease compared the addition of cetuximab as a single agent to best supportive care (BSC) \n(287 patients) with best supportive care (285 patients).

Intravenous \ninfusions of cetuximab exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics at weekly doses ranging from 5 to \n500 mg/m2 body surface area.\n\nWhen cetuximab was administered at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 body surface area, the mean \nvolume of distribution was approximately equivalent to the vascular space (2.9 L/m2 with a range of \n1.5 to 6.2 L/m2). The mean Cmax (\uf0b1 standard deviation) was 185\uf0b155 microgram per mL. The mean \nclearance was 0.022 L/h per m\u00b2 body surface area. Cetuximab has a long elimination half-life with \nvalues ranging from 70 to 100 hours at the target dose.\n\nCetuximab serum concentrations reached stable levels after three weeks of cetuximab monotherapy. \nMean peak cetuximab concentrations were 155.8 microgram per mL in week 3 and 151.6 microgram \nper mL in week 8, whereas the corresponding mean trough concentrations were 41.3 and \n55.4 microgram per mL, respectively. In a study of cetuximab administered in combination with \nirinotecan, the mean cetuximab trough levels were 50.0 microgram per mL in week 12 and \n49.4 microgram per mL in week 36.\n\nSeveral pathways have been described that may contribute to the metabolism of antibodies. All of \nthese pathways involve the biodegradation of the antibody to smaller molecules, i.e. small peptides or \namino acids.\n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\n\nAn integrated analysis across all clinical studies showed that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of \ncetuximab are not influenced by race, age, gender, renal or hepatic status.\n\nOnly patients with adequate renal and hepatic function have been investigated to date (serum \ncreatinine \uf0a3 1.5fold, transaminases \uf0a3 5fold and bilirubin \uf0a3 1.5fold the upper limit of normal).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nIn a phase-I study in paediatric patients (1-18 years) with refractory solid tumours, cetuximab was \nadministered in combination with irinotecan. The pharmacokinetic results were comparable to those in \nadults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nDose-dependent skin alterations, starting at dose levels equivalent to those used in humans, were the \nmajor findings observed in toxicity studies with Cynomolgus monkeys (a chronic repeat-dose toxicity \nstudy and an embryo-foetal development study).\n\nAn embryo-foetal toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys revealed no signs of teratogenicity. \nHowever, dependent on the dose, an increased incidence of abortion was observed.\n\nNon-clinical data on genotoxicity and local tolerance including accidental administration by routes \nother than the intended infusion revealed no special hazard for humans.\n\n\n\n18\n\nNo formal animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of cetuximab or \nto determine its effects on male and female fertility.\n\nToxicity studies with co-administration of cetuximab and chemotherapeutic agents have not been \nperformed.\n\nNo non-clinical data on the effect of cetuximab on wound healing are available to date. However, in \npreclinical wound healing models EGFR selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors were shown to retard \nwound healing.\n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n29\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nErbitux 5 mg/mL solution for infusion\nCetuximab\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n\uf02d Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n\uf02d If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.\n\uf02d If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Erbitux is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Erbitux\n3. How to use Erbitux\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Erbitux\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Erbitux is and what it is used for\n\nWhat Erbitux is\n\nErbitux contains cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that \nspecifically recognise and bind to other unique proteins called antigens. Cetuximab binds to the \nepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an antigen on the surface of certain cancer cells. EGFR \nactivates proteins called RAS. RAS proteins play an important role in the EGFR pathway \u2013 a complex \nsignalling cascade which is involved in the development and progression of cancer. As a result of this \nbinding, the cancer cell can no longer receive the messages it needs for growth, progression and \nmetastasis.\n\nWhat Erbitux is used for\n\nErbitux is used to treat two different types of cancer:\n\n\uf0b7 metastatic cancer of the large intestine. In these patients, Erbitux is used alone or in combination \nwith other anticancer medicines.\n\n\uf0b7 a certain type of cancer of the head and neck (squamous cell cancer). In these patients, Erbitux \nis used in combination with radiation therapy or with other anticancer medicines.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Erbitux\n\nDo not use Erbitux\n\nDo not use Erbitux if you have ever had a severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to cetuximab.\n\nBefore starting treatment for metastatic cancer of the large intestine your doctor will test your cancer\ncells if they contain the normal (wild-type) or mutant form of RAS. You must not receive Erbitux in \ncombination with other anticancer treatment containing oxaliplatin if your cancer cells contain the \nmutant form of RAS.\n\n\n\n30\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor before using Erbitux, if any of the following information is not clear.\n\nErbitux may cause infusion-related side effects. Such reactions may be allergic in nature. Please read \n'Infusion-related side effects' in section 4 for details, as they may have serious consequences for you, \nincluding life-threatening conditions. These side effects normally occur during the infusion, within \n1 hour afterwards, or sometimes also after this period. To recognise early signs of such effects, your \ncondition will be checked regularly while you receive each infusion of Erbitux and for at least 1 hour \nafterwards.\nYou are more likely to experience severe allergic reactions if you are allergic to red meat, tick bites or \nhad positive results for certain antibodies (seen in a test). Your doctor will discuss appropriate \nmeasures with you.\n\nErbitux may cause side effects concerning the skin. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you \nmay need any preventive measures or early treatment. Please also read 'Side effects concerning the \nskin' in section 4 for details, as some skin reactions may have serious consequences for you, including \nlife-threatening conditions.\n\nIf you have heart problems, your doctor will discuss with you whether you can receive Erbitux in \ncombination with other anticancer medicines, especially if you are 65 years of age or older.\nErbitux may cause side effects concerning the eyes. Please tell your doctor, if you have acute or \nworsening eye problems such as blurred vision, eye pain, red eyes and/or severe dry eye, if you have \nhad such problems in the past or if you use contact lenses. Your doctor will discuss with you whether \nyou need to consult a specialist.\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with anticancer medicines including platinum, it is more likely \nthat your white blood cell count may be reduced. Your doctor will therefore monitor your blood and \ngeneral condition for signs of infection (see also 'Side effects in combination with other anticancer \ntreatments' in section 4).\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, including fluoropyrimidines, it \nmay be more likely that you experience heart problems which may be life-threatening. Your doctor \nwill discuss with you whether you may need any particular supervision (see also 'Side effects in \ncombination with other anticancer treatments' in section 4).\n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no relevant use of Erbitux in children and adolescents.\n\nOther medicines and Erbitux\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nPregnancy\n\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you are not using reliable contraception (speak to your doctor \nif you are not sure). Your doctor will then discuss with you the risks and benefits of using Erbitux in \nthese situations.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nDo not breast-feed your baby during the period over which you are being treated with Erbitux and for \ntwo months after the last dose.\n\n\n\n31\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you experience treatment-related symptoms that affect \nyour ability to concentrate and react.\n\n3. How to use Erbitux\n\nA doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines will supervise your Erbitux therapy. During \neach infusion and for at least 1 hour afterwards, your condition will be checked regularly for early \nsigns of a possible infusion-related side effect.\n\nPre-treatment\n\nBefore the first dose, you will receive an antiallergic medicine in order to reduce the risk of an allergic \nreaction. Your doctor will decide whether such pre-treatment is necessary for subsequent doses.\n\nDosage and administration\n\nErbitux is usually infused into a vein (given as a drip) once a week. Your doctor will calculate the \ncorrect dose of Erbitux for you because it depends on your body surface area. The first dose \n(400 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is infused over a period of approximately 2 hours with an infusion rate \nnot faster than 5 mg/min. Each subsequent dose (250 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is infused in \napproximately 1 hour with an infusion rate not faster than 10 mg/min.\n\nDetailed instructions for your doctor or your nurse on how to prepare the Erbitux infusion are included \nat the end of this package leaflet (see 'Handling instructions').\n\nDuration of treatment\n\nErbitux is usually infused once a week. The duration of treatment may vary depending on your disease \nas well as from person to person and your doctor will therefore discuss with you how long you will \nreceive Erbitux.\n\nCombination with other anticancer treatments\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, these medicines must be \nadministered at least 1 hour after the end of the Erbitux infusion.\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with radiation therapy, treatment with Erbitux is usually started \none week before radiation therapy.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nThe main side effects of Erbitux are infusion-related side effects and side effects concerning the skin:\n\nInfusion-related side effects\n\nMore than 10 out of 100 patients are likely to experience infusion-related side effects; in more than 1 \nout of 100 patients these side effects are likely to be severe. Such reactions may be allergic in nature. \nThey normally occur during the infusion, within 1 hour afterwards, or sometimes also after this period.\n\n\n\n32\n\nMild or moderate infusion-related side effects include:\n\uf0b7 fever\n\uf0b7 chills\n\uf0b7 dizziness\n\uf0b7 breathing difficulties \nIf such symptoms occur, please inform your doctor as soon as possible.

These side effects may have serious \nconsequences, in rare cases including life-threatening conditions, and require immediate attention. \nTreatment with Erbitux must then be stopped.\n\nSide effects concerning the skin\n\nMore than 80 out of 100 patients are likely to experience side effects involving the skin. In about 15 \nout of 100 patients these skin reactions are likely to be severe. Most of these side effects develop \nwithin the first three weeks of treatment. They usually disappear over time after the end of Erbitux \ntherapy.\n\nMain side effects concerning the skin include:\n\uf0b7 acne-like skin alterations\n\uf0b7 itching\n\uf0b7 dry skin\n\uf0b7 scaling\n\uf0b7 excessive growth of hair\n\uf0b7 nail disorders, for example inflammation of the nail bed \n\nIn very rare cases (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) patients may experience blistering or peeling \nof the skin, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called \u201cStevens-Johnson syndrome\u201d. If you \nexperience these symptoms, please speak to a doctor immediately, because these signs may have \nserious consequences including life-threatening conditions.\n\nIf you notice other extensive skin alterations, please inform your doctor as soon as possible \nbecause the Erbitux dose or the time between infusions may need to be changed. Your doctor will \ndecide whether treatment has to be stopped if skin reactions reappear after several dose reductions.\n\nIf you notice that already affected areas of your skin get worse, speak to a doctor immediately,\nespecially if you also experience general signs of infection such as fever and tiredness. These signs \nmay indicate a skin infection, which may have serious consequences including life-threatening \nconditions.\n\nSide effects concerning the lungs\n\nIn uncommon cases (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) patients may experience an inflammation of the \nlungs (called interstitial lung disease), which may have serious consequences including life-\nthreatening conditions.\n\nIf you notice symptoms such as occurrence or worsening of breathing difficulties, speak to a \ndoctor immediately, especially if you also experience cough or fever. Your doctor will decide \nwhether treatment has to be stopped.\n\n\n\n33\n\nOther side effects\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lining of the intestine, mouth, and nose (in some cases severe), which may \n\nlead to nose bleeding in some patients\n\uf0b7 decrease in blood levels of magnesium \n\uf0b7 increase in blood levels of certain liver enzymes\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 tiredness\n\uf0b7 irritation and redness of the eye\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 drying out which may be due to diarrhoea or reduced fluid intake\n\uf0b7 feeling sick\n\uf0b7 vomiting\n\uf0b7 loss of appetite, leading to weight decrease\n\uf0b7 decrease in blood levels of calcium\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n\uf0b7 blood clots in the veins of the legs\n\uf0b7 blood clots in the lungs\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the eye lid or the front part of the eye\n\nSide effects of which the frequency is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lining of the brain (aseptic meningitis)\n\nSide effects in combination with other anticancer treatments\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, some of the side effects you \nmay experience can also be related to the combination or the other medicines. Therefore, please make \nsure that you also read the package leaflet for the other medicines.\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with anticancer medicines including platinum, it is more likely \nthat your white blood cell count may be reduced. This may lead to infectious complications including \nlife-threatening conditions, especially if you experience skin reactions, inflammation of the lining of \nthe intestine and mouth or diarrhoea. Therefore, if you experience general signs of infection such as \nfever and tiredness, please speak to a doctor immediately.\n\nIf you receive Erbitux in combination with an anticancer medicine containing fluoropyrimidines, it is \nmore likely that you experience the following side effects of this other medicine:\n\uf0b7 chest pain\n\uf0b7 heart attack\n\uf0b7 heart failure\n\uf0b7 redness and swelling of the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet which may cause the skin \n\nto peel (hand-foot syndrome)\n\nIf you receive Erbitux with radiation therapy, some of the side effects you may experience can also be \nrelated to this combination, such as:\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lining of the intestine and mouth\n\uf0b7 skin reactions typical for radiation therapy\n\uf0b7 difficulty in swallowing \n\uf0b7 reduction in the number of white blood cells\n\n\n\n34\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.

Contents of the pack and other information\n\nWhat Erbitux contains\n\n\uf0b7 The active substance is cetuximab.\nEach mL of the solution for infusion contains 5 mg cetuximab.\nEach vial of 20 mL contains 100 mg cetuximab.\nEach vial of 100 mL contains 500 mg cetuximab.\n\n\uf0b7 The other ingredients are sodium chloride, glycine, polysorbate 80, citric acid monohydrate, \nsodium hydroxide and water for injections.\n\nWhat Erbitux looks like and contents of the pack\n\nErbitux 5 mg/mL solution for infusion is supplied in vials containing 20 mL or 100 mL.\nEach pack contains 1 vial.\n\nNot all vial sizes may be marketed.\n\nMarketing Authorisation Holder\n\nMerck Europe B.V.\nGustav Mahlerplein 102\n1082 MA Amsterdam\nThe Netherlands\n\nManufacturer\n\nMerck Healthcare KGaA\nFrankfurter Stra\u00dfe 250\n64293 Darmstadt\nGermany\n\nThis leaflet was last revised in MM/YYYY.\n\nOther sources of information\n\nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/.\n\n\n\n35\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:\n\nHandling instructions\n\nErbitux may be administered via a gravity drip, an infusion pump or a syringe pump. Since Erbitux is \nonly compatible with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, it must not be \nmixed with other intravenously applied medicinal products. A separate infusion line must be used for \nthe infusion, and the line must be flushed with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection at the end of infusion.\n\nErbitux 5 mg/mL is compatible\n\uf0b7 with polyethylene (PE), ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags,\n\uf0b7 with polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PUR), ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), polyolefine \n\nthermoplastic (TP) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) infusion sets,\n\uf0b7 with polypropylene (PP) syringes for syringe pump.\n\nErbitux 5 mg/mL is chemically and physically stable for up to 48 hours at 25\u00b0C, if the solution is\nprepared as described hereafter. However, since it does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or \nbacteriostatic agent, it is intended for immediate use. Care must be taken to ensure aseptic handling \nwhen preparing the infusion. Erbitux 5 mg/mL must be prepared as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 For administration with infusion pump or gravity drip (diluted with sterile sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution): Take an infusion bag of adequate size of sterile sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution. Calculate the required volume of Erbitux. Remove an adequate \nvolume of the sodium chloride solution from the infusion bag, using an appropriate sterile \nsyringe with a suitable needle. Take an appropriate sterile syringe and attach a suitable needle. \nDraw up the required volume of Erbitux from a vial. Transfer the Erbitux into the prepared \ninfusion bag. Repeat this procedure until the calculated volume has been reached. Connect the \ninfusion line and prime it with the diluted Erbitux before starting the infusion. Use a gravity drip \nor an infusion pump for administration. The first dose (400 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is infused \nover a period of approximately 2 hours with an infusion rate not faster than 5 mg/min. Each \nsubsequent dose (250 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is infused in approximately 1 hour with an \ninfusion rate not faster than 10 mg/min.\n\n\uf0b7 For administration with infusion pump or gravity drip (undiluted): Calculate the required \nvolume of Erbitux. Take an appropriate sterile syringe (minimum 50 mL) and attach a suitable \nneedle. Draw up the required volume of Erbitux from a vial. Transfer the Erbitux into a sterile \nevacuated container or bag. Repeat this procedure until the calculated volume has been reached. \nConnect the infusion line and prime it with Erbitux before starting the infusion. The first dose \n(400 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is infused over a period of approximately 2 hours with an \ninfusion rate not faster than 5 mg/min. Each subsequent dose (250 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is \ninfused in approximately 1 hour with an infusion rate not faster than 10 mg/min.\n\n\uf0b7 For administration with a syringe pump: Calculate the required volume of Erbitux. Take an \nappropriate sterile syringe and attach a suitable needle. Draw up the required volume of Erbitux \nfrom a vial. Remove the needle and put the syringe into the syringe pump. Connect the infusion \nline to the syringe and start the infusion after priming the line with Erbitux or sterile sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution. Repeat this procedure until the calculated volume has been \ninfused. The first dose (400 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area) is infused over a period of approximately \n2 hours with an infusion rate not faster than 5 mg/min. Each subsequent dose (250 mg/m\u00b2 body \nsurface area) is infused in approximately 1 hour with an infusion rate not faster than 10 mg/min.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

do not use erbitux if you have ever had a severe hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to cetuximab. before starting treatment for metastatic cancer of the large intestine your doctor will test your cancer cells if they contain the normal (wild-type) or mutant form of ras. you must not receive erbitux in combination with other anticancer treatment containing oxaliplatin if your cancer cells contain the mutant form of ras. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before using erbitux, if any of the following information is not clear. erbitux may cause infusion-related side effects. such reactions may be allergic in nature. please read 'infusion-related side effects' in section 4 for details, as they may have serious consequences for you, including life-threatening conditions. these side effects normally occur during the infusion, within 1 hour afterwards, or sometimes also after this period. to recognise early signs of such effects, your condition will be checked regularly while you receive each infusion of erbitux and for at least 1 hour afterwards. you are more likely to experience severe allergic reactions if you are allergic to red meat, tick bites or had positive results for certain antibodies (seen in a test). your doctor will discuss appropriate measures with you. erbitux may cause side effects concerning the skin. your doctor will discuss with you whether you may need any preventive measures or early treatment. please also read 'side effects concerning the skin' in section 4 for details, as some skin reactions may have serious consequences for you, including life-threatening conditions. if you have heart problems, your doctor will discuss with you whether you can receive erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, especially if you are 65 years of age or older. erbitux may cause side effects concerning the eyes. please tell your doctor, if you have acute or worsening eye problems such as blurred vision, eye pain, red eyes and/or severe dry eye, if you have had such problems in the past or if you use contact lenses. your doctor will discuss with you whether you need to consult a specialist. if you receive erbitux in combination with anticancer medicines including platinum, it is more likely that your white blood cell count may be reduced. your doctor will therefore monitor your blood and general condition for signs of infection (see also 'side effects in combination with other anticancer treatments' in section 4). if you receive erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, including fluoropyrimidines, it may be more likely that you experience heart problems which may be life-threatening. your doctor will discuss with you whether you may need any particular supervision (see also 'side effects in combination with other anticancer treatments' in section 4). children and adolescents there is no relevant use of erbitux in children and adolescents. other medicines and erbitux tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. pregnancy tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you are not using reliable contraception (speak to your doctor if you are not sure). your doctor will then discuss with you the risks and benefits of using erbitux in these situations. breast-feeding do not breast-feed your baby during the period over which you are being treated with erbitux and for two months after the last dose. driving and using machines do not drive or use any tools or machines if you experience treatment-related symptoms that affect your ability to concentrate and react.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "erbitux", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},

effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. the main side effects of erbitux are infusion-related side effects and side effects concerning the skin: infusion-related side effects more than 10 out of 100 patients are likely to experience infusion-related side effects; in more than 1 out of 100 patients these side effects are likely to be severe. such reactions may be allergic in nature. they normally occur during the infusion, within 1 hour afterwards, or sometimes also after this period. mild or moderate infusion-related side effects include: fever chills dizziness breathing difficulties if such symptoms occur, please inform your doctor as soon as possible. your doctor may consider reducing the infusion rate of erbitux to manage these symptoms. severe infusion-related side effects include: severe breathing difficulties which develop rapidly hives fainting chest pain (a symptom of side effects on your heart) if such symptoms occur, speak to a doctor immediately. these side effects may have serious consequences, in rare cases including life-threatening conditions, and require immediate attention. treatment with erbitux must then be stopped. side effects concerning the skin more than 80 out of 100 patients are likely to experience side effects involving the skin. in about 15 out of 100 patients these skin reactions are likely to be severe. most of these side effects develop within the first three weeks of treatment. they usually disappear over time after the end of erbitux therapy. main side effects concerning the skin include: acne-like skin alterations itching dry skin scaling excessive growth of hair nail disorders, for example inflammation of the nail bed in very rare cases (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) patients may experience blistering or peeling of the skin, which may indicate a severe skin reaction called \"stevens-johnson syndrome\". if you experience these symptoms, please speak to a doctor immediately, because these signs may have serious consequences including life-threatening conditions. if you notice other extensive skin alterations, please inform your doctor as soon as possible because the erbitux dose or the time between infusions may need to be changed. your doctor will decide whether treatment has to be stopped if skin reactions reappear after several dose reductions. if you notice that already affected areas of your skin get worse, speak to a doctor immediately, especially if you also experience general signs of infection such as fever and tiredness. these signs may indicate a skin infection, which may have serious consequences including life-threatening conditions. side effects concerning the lungs in uncommon cases (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) patients may experience an inflammation of the lungs (called interstitial lung disease), which may have serious consequences including life- threatening conditions. if you notice symptoms such as occurrence or worsening of breathing difficulties, speak to a doctor immediately, especially if you also experience cough or fever. your doctor will decide whether treatment has to be stopped. other side effects very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) inflammation of the lining of the intestine, mouth, and nose (in some cases severe), which may lead to nose bleeding in some patients decrease in blood levels of magnesium increase in blood levels of certain liver enzymes common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) headache tiredness irritation and redness of the eye diarrhoea drying out which may be due to diarrhoea or reduced fluid intake feeling sick vomiting loss of appetite, leading to weight decrease decrease in blood levels of calcium uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) blood clots in the veins of the legs blood clots in the lungs inflammation of the eye lid or the front part of the eye side effects of which the frequency is not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) inflammation of the lining of the brain (aseptic meningitis) side effects in combination with other anticancer treatments if you receive erbitux in combination with other anticancer medicines, some of the side effects you may experience can also be related to the combination or the other medicines. therefore, please make sure that you also read the package leaflet for the other medicines. if you receive erbitux in combination with anticancer medicines including platinum, it is more likely that your white blood cell count may be reduced. this may lead to infectious complications including life-threatening conditions, especially if you experience skin reactions, inflammation of the lining of the intestine and mouth or diarrhoea. therefore, if you experience general signs of infection such as fever and tiredness, please speak to a doctor immediately. if you receive erbitux in combination with an anticancer medicine containing fluoropyrimidines, it is more likely that you experience the following side effects of this other medicine: chest pain heart attack heart failure redness and swelling of the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet which may cause the skin to peel (hand-foot syndrome) if you receive erbitux with radiation therapy, some of the side effects you may experience can also be related to this combination, such as: inflammation of the lining of the intestine and mouth skin reactions typical for radiation therapy difficulty in swallowing reduction in the number of white blood cells 34 reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "erbitux", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "all medicines", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 5, "EndOffset": 18},
