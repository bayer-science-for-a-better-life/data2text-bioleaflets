NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYttriga radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 ml sterile solution contains 0.1-300 GBq Yttrium (90Y) on the reference date and time \n(corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium [90Y]) (as Yttrium [90Y] chloride). \n \nEach 3ml vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at \nreference date and time. The volume is 0.02-3 ml.  \nEach 10ml vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at \nreference date and time. The volume is 0.02-5 ml.  \nThe theoretical specific activity is 20 GBq/microgram of Yttrium (90Y) (see section 6.5). \n \nYttrium (90Y) chloride is produced by decay of its radioactive precursor Strontium (90Sr). It decays by \nemission of beta radiation of 2.281 MeV (99.98 %) of maximal energy to stable Zirconium (90Zr). \nYttrium (90Y) has a half-life of 2.67 days (64.1 hours). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nRadiopharmaceutical precursor, solution. \n \nClear colourless solution, free of particulate matter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTo be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed \nand authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide. \n \n\nRadiopharmaceutical precursor - Not intended for direct use in patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nYttriga is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. \n \nPosology \n \nThe quantity of Yttriga required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal \nproduct that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and its \nintended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nYttriga is intended for in vitro labelling of medicinal products which are subsequently administered by \nthe approved route. \nFurther information on the preparation of the product is given in section 12. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nDo not administer Yttriga directly to the patient. \nYttriga is contraindicated in the following cases: \n- Hypersensitivity to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or to any of the excipients \n \nYttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products are contraindicated in the following case: \n- Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6) \n \nFor information on contraindications to particular Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared \nby radiolabelling with Yttriga refer the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nparticular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nThe contents of the vial of Yttriga is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for \nthe radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \ndesignated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations \nand appropriate licences of the competent authorities. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety \nand pharmaceutical quality requirements. \n \nFor information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled \nmedicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. \n \nParticular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and \nadolescents (from 2 to 16 years old). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies of Yttrium (90Y) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed, \nbecause Yttriga is a precursor solution for radiolabelling medicinal products. \n \nFor information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal \nproducts refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and after treatment. \n \nPregnancy \nYttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products are contraindicated in established or suspected pregnancy or \nwhen pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nBefore administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration \nshould be given to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased \nbreast-feeding. If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be advised to stop \nbreast-feeding. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nFurther information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy \nand breast-feeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to \nbe radiolabelled. \n \nFertility \nFurther information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal concerning fertility is \nspecified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nEffects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Yttrium (90Y)-labelled \nmedicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nmedicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nPossible adverse reactions following the intravenous administration of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled \nmedicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, will be dependent on the specific medicinal \nproduct being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. For each patient, exposure \nto ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The activity administered \nmust be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in mind the \nneed to obtain the intended therapeutic result. \n \nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. \n \nThe radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and \nmutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the \ndisease itself. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe presence of free Yttrium (90Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Yttriga \nwill lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stern cell damage. \nTherefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Yttriga, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be \nreduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-\n DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body. \n \nThe following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Yttriga for labelling of \ncarrier molecules for therapeutic purposes: \n- Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or \n- Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) \n \nThese chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the \nyttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, \nEDTA). These complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n5 \n\n1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 \u2013 4 minutes or \nby infusion (1 g in 100 \u2013 250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline). \n \nThe chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is \ncirculating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does \nnot preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. \nIntravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours. \n \nIn any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions \nimmediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow. \n \nThe toxicity of the free Yttrium (90Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body \nduring therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code:  V10X. \nThe pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the \nparticular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by \nradiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal \nproduct to be radiolabelled. \n \nIn the rat, following intravenous administration, Yttrium (90Y) chloride is rapidly cleared from the \nblood. At 1 and 24 hours, blood radioactivity decreases from 11.0 % to 0.14 % of the administered \nactivity. The two main organs where Yttrium (90Y) chloride distributes are the liver and bones. In the \nliver, 18 % of the injected activity is taken up 5 min after injection. Liver uptake decreases then to \n8.4 % 24 hours after injection. In bone, percentage of injected activity increases from 3.1 % at 5 min \nto 18 % at 6 hours and then decreases with time. Faecal and urinary elimination is slow: about 31 % of \nthe administered activity is eliminated in 15 days. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling \nwith Yttriga prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nThere are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium (90Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction \nin animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nHydrochloric acid (0.04 M) \n \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nRadiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, \nwith Yttrium (90Y) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities. \nIt is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the radiolabelled \nmedicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only \nsyringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to \nminimise trace metal impurity levels. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUp to 12 days from the date of manufacture. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStorage should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive material. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nColourless type I glass vial of 3 ml with a V-shapped bottom or a colourless type I glass vial of 10 ml \nwith a flat bottom with a silicon stopper, closed with an aluminium seal.  \n \nPack size: 1 vial   \nNot all presentations may be marketed.  \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal \n \nThe vial may contain high pressure due to radiolysis (see section 12). \n \n \n7.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS \n \nBefore use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an \nionisation chamber. Yttrium (90Y) is a beta pure emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation \nchamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and, therefore, should be performed only under \ngeometric conditions which have been appropriately validated. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nUsual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected. \n \nThe vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding. The product should be \naseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilised single use needle and syringe after \ndisinfecting the stopper. \nAppropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with the requirements of Good \nPharmaceutical Manufacturing Practice, in order to maintain the sterility of Yttriga and to maintain \nsterility throughout the labelling procedures. \nThe administration of radioactive medicinal products creates risks for other persons from external \nradiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in \naccordance with national regulations must therefore be taken. \n \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nDetailed information on this product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX II \n \nA.

WHAT YTTRIGA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  \n \nYttriga is a radioactive medicine used in combination with another medicine which targets specific \nbody cells. \nWhen the target is reached, Yttriga gives tiny radiation doses to these specific sites. \n \nFor further information regarding the treatment and possible effects caused by the radiolabelled \nmedicinal product, please refer to the package leaflet of the medicinal product used as combination \npartner.  \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE YTTRIGA  \n \nDo not use Yttriga:  \n \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or any of the other ingredients of \n\nYttriga. \n- if you are pregnant or if there is a possibility that you may be pregnant (see below). \n \nTake special care with Yttriga  \n- Yttriga is a radioactive medicine and is only used in combination with another medicinal product. It \n\nis not intended for direct use in patients. \n- Because there are strict laws covering the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceuticals, \n\nYttriga will always be used in a hospital or a similar setting. It will only be handled and \nadministered by people who are trained and qualified in the safe handling of radioactive material. \n\n \nParticular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and \nadolescents (from 2 to 16 years old). \n \n \nTaking other medicines  \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist, if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \nNo interactions of Yttrium (90Y) chloride with other medicines are known as no clinical studies are \navailable.  \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nPregnancy  \nYttriga is contraindicated in Pregnancy. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if there is any possibility that you are pregnant. If you have missed a period, \nyou should assume to be pregnant until a pregnancy test conducted is negative.  \n \nYour doctor will consider alternative techniques which do not involve ionising radiation. \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \nYour doctor will ask you to stop breast-feeding.  \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE YTTRIGA  \n \nYour doctor will not administer Yttriga directly. \n \nDose \nYour physician will decide on the amount of Yttriga, which you will receive for the treatment. \n \nMethod of administration \nYttriga is intended for radiolabelling of medicinal products to treat specific diseases, which are \nsubsequently administered by approved route. \n \nIf Yttriga is administered inadvertently \nYttriga is administered after being combined with another medicine by your doctor under strictly \ncontrolled conditions. The risk to receive a possible overdose is small. However, should this occur, \nyou will receive appropriate treatment from your doctor. \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS  \n \nLike all medicines, Yttriga can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nFor more information, refer to the package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be \nradiolabelled. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB CONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION\n\tA. LABELLING\n\tB. PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\nANNEX I\n\n\nSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\n\n1.\nNAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nYttriga radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution.\n\n\n2.\nQUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\n\n1 ml sterile solution contains 0.1-300 GBq Yttrium (90Y) on the reference date and time (corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium [90Y]) (as Yttrium [90Y] chloride).\n\n\nEach 3ml vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at reference date and time. The volume is 0.02-3 ml. \n\nEach 10ml vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at reference date and time. The volume is 0.02-5 ml. \n\nThe theoretical specific activity is 20\u00a0GBq/microgram of Yttrium (90Y) (see section 6.5).\n\n\nYttrium (90Y) chloride is produced by decay of its radioactive precursor Strontium (90Sr). It decays by emission of beta radiation of 2.281 MeV (99.98 %) of maximal energy to stable Zirconium (90Zr).\n\n\nYttrium (90Y) has a half-life of 2.67 days (64.1 hours).\n\nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n\n3.\nPHARMACEUTICAL form\n\nRadiopharmaceutical precursor, solution.\n\n\nClear colourless solution, free of particulate matter.\n\n\n4.\nClinical particulars\n\n4.1\nTherapeutic indications\n\nTo be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed\n\n\nand authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.\n\n\n\t\tRadiopharmaceutical precursor - Not intended for direct use in patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nPosology and method of administration\n\nYttriga is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling.\n\nPosology\n\n\nThe quantity of Yttriga required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and its intended use. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\nMethod of administration\n\n\nYttriga is intended for in vitro labelling of medicinal products which are subsequently administered by the approved route.\n\n\nFurther information on the preparation of the product is given in section 12.\n\n\n4.3\nContraindications\n\nDo not administer Yttriga directly to the patient.\n\n\nYttriga is contraindicated in the following cases:\n\n\n-\nHypersensitivity to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or to any of the excipients\n\n\nYttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products are contraindicated in the following case:\n\n\n-\nEstablished or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6)\n\nFor information on contraindications to particular Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga refer the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\n4.4\nSpecial warnings and precautions for use\n\nThe contents of the vial of Yttriga is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates.\n\n\nRadiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and appropriate licences of the competent authorities.\n\n\nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements.\n\n\nFor information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\nParticular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and adolescents (from 2 to 16 years old).\n\n\n4.5\nInteraction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nNo interaction studies of Yttrium (90Y) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed, because Yttriga is a precursor solution for radiolabelling medicinal products.\n\n\nFor information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\n4.6\nFertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and after treatment.\n\nPregnancy\n\n\nYttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products are contraindicated in established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.3).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\n\nBefore administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breast-feeding. If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be advised to stop breast-feeding.\n\n\nFurther information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products in pregnancy and breast-feeding is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\nFertility\n\n\nFurther information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal concerning fertility is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\n4.7\nEffects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nEffects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\n4.8\nUndesirable effects\n\n\nPossible adverse reactions following the intravenous administration of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit. The activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result.\n\n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects.\n\n\nThe radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself.\n\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9\nOverdose\n\nThe presence of free Yttrium (90Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Yttriga will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stern cell damage.\n\n\nTherefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Yttriga, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca-\u00a0DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body.\n\n\nThe following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Yttriga for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes:\n\n\n-\nCa-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or\n\n\n-\nCa-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)\n\n\nThese chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the yttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA). These complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.\n\n\n1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 \u2013 4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 \u2013 250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline).\n\n\nThe chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency.\n\n\nIntravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours.\n\n\nIn any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow.\n\n\nThe toxicity of the free Yttrium (90Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.\n\n\n5.\nPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 \nPharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code:  V10X.\n\nThe pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by\n\n\nradiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\n5.2\nPharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\nIn the rat, following intravenous administration, Yttrium (90Y) chloride is rapidly cleared from the blood. At 1 and 24 hours, blood radioactivity decreases from 11.0 % to 0.14 % of the administered activity. The two main organs where Yttrium (90Y) chloride distributes are the liver and bones. In the liver, 18 % of the injected activity is taken up 5 min after injection. Liver uptake decreases then to 8.4\u00a0% 24 hours after injection. In bone, percentage of injected activity increases from 3.1 % at 5 min to 18\u00a0% at 6 hours and then decreases with time. Faecal and urinary elimination is slow: about 31 % of the administered activity is eliminated in 15 days.\n\n\n5.3\nPreclinical safety data\n\nThe toxicological properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\nThere are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium (90Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction in animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential.\n\n\n6.\nPHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n\n6.1\nList of excipients\n\nHydrochloric acid (0.04 M)\n\n6.2\nIncompatibilities\n\nRadiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates, with Yttrium (90Y) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.\n\n\nIt is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimise trace metal impurity levels.\n\n6.3\nShelf life\n\nUp to 12 days from the date of manufacture.\n\n\n6.4\nSpecial precautions for storage\n\nStorage should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive material.\n\n\n6.5\nNature and contents of container\n\nColourless type I glass vial of 3 ml with a V-shapped bottom or a colourless type I glass vial of 10 ml with a flat bottom with a silicon stopper, closed with an aluminium seal. \n\nPack size: 1 vial  \n\nNot all presentations may be marketed. \n\n6.6\nSpecial precautions for disposal\n\nThe vial may contain high pressure due to radiolysis (see section 12).\n\n7.\nMARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER\n\nEckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH\n\n\nRobert-R\u00f6ssle-Str. 10\n\nD-13125 Berlin\n\nGermany\n\n\n8.\nMARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S) \n\n\nEU/1/05/322/001 (3 ml V-shaped vial)\n\nEU/1/05/322/002 (10 ml flat bottom vial)\n\n\n9.\nDATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION\n\nDate of first authorisation: 19/01/2006 \n\nDate of renewal: 06/01/2011\n\n10.\nDATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT\n\n\n11. \nDOSIMETRY\n\nThe radiation dose received by the various organs following intravenous administration of an\n\n\nYttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product is dependent on the specific medicinal product being\n\n\nradiolabelled. Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the radiolabelled preparation will be available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.\n\n\nThe dosimetry table below is presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated Yttrium (90Y) to the radiation dose following the administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product or resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of Yttriga.\n\n\nThe dosimetry estimates were based on a rat distribution study and the calculations were effected in accordance with MIRD/ICRP 60 recommendations. Time-points for measurements were 5 min, 1, 6, 24, 96 and 360 hours.\n\n\n\t\tAbsorbed dose per unit activity administered (mGy/MBq)\n\n\n\n\n\t\tOrgan\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAdult \n\n\n(70 kg)\n\n\t\t15 years \n\n\n(50 kg)\n\n\t\t10 years \n\n\n(30 kg)\n\n\t\t5 years\n\n\n(17 kg)\n\n\t\t1 year\n\n\n(10 kg)\n\n\t\tNewborn\n\n\n(5 kg)\n\n\n\n\t\tAdrenals\n\n\t\t7.23 E-01\n\n\t\t1.09 E+00\n\n\t\t2.53 E+00\n\n\t\t3.62 E+00\n\n\t\t7.23 E+00\n\n\t\t2.17 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tBlood\n\n\t\t4.20 E-02\n\n\t\t6.29 E-02\n\n\t\t1.47 E-01\n\n\t\t2.10 E-01\n\n\t\t4.19 E-01\n\n\t\t1.26 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tBone marrow\n\n\t\t2.58 E+00\n\n\t\t3.88 E+00\n\n\t\t9.05 E+00\n\n\t\t1.29 E+01\n\n\t\t2.58 E+01\n\n\t\t7.75 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tBrain\n\n\t\t8.60 E-03\n\n\t\t1.29 E-02\n\n\t\t3.01 E-02\n\n\t\t4.30 E-02\n\n\t\t8.60 E-02\n\n\t\t2.58 E-01\n\n\n\n\t\tCarcass\n\n\t\t5.82 E-01\n\n\t\t8.72 E-01\n\n\t\t2.04 E+00\n\n\t\t2.91 E+00\n\n\t\t5.82 E+00\n\n\t\t1.75 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tColon\n\n\t\t2.30 E-02\n\n\t\t3.46 E-02\n\n\t\t8.06 E-02\n\n\t\t1.15 E-01\n\n\t\t2.30 E-01\n\n\t\t6.91 E-01\n\n\n\n\t\tFemur\n\n\t\t7.76 E+00\n\n\t\t1.16 E+01\n\n\t\t2.72 E+01\n\n\t\t3.88 E+01\n\n\t\t7.76 E+01\n\n\t\t2.33 E+02\n\n\n\n\t\tGastro-intestinal content\n\n\t\t1.22 E-01\n\n\t\t1.83 E-01\n\n\t\t4.26 E-01\n\n\t\t6.09 E-01\n\n\t\t1.22 E+00\n\n\t\t3.66 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tHeart\n\n\t\t2.53 E-01\n\n\t\t3.79 E-01\n\n\t\t8.85 E-01\n\n\t\t1.26 E+00\n\n\t\t2.53 E+00\n\n\t\t7.59 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tIleum\n\n\t\t1.16 E-02\n\n\t\t1.74 E-02\n\n\t\t4.06 E-02\n\n\t\t5.81 E-02\n\n\t\t1.16 E-01\n\n\t\t3.48 E-01\n\n\n\n\t\tKidneys \n\n\t\t2.35 E+00\n\n\t\t3.53 E+00\n\n\t\t8.24 E+00\n\n\t\t1.18 E+01\n\n\t\t2.35 E+01\n\n\t\t7.06 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tLiver\n\n\t\t1.27 E+00\n\n\t\t1.91 E+00\n\n\t\t4.46 E+00\n\n\t\t6.37 E+00\n\n\t\t1.27 E+01\n\n\t\t3.82 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tLungs\n\n\t\t4.23 E-01\n\n\t\t6.34 E-01\n\n\t\t1.48 E+00\n\n\t\t2.11 E+00\n\n\t\t4.23 E+00\n\n\t\t1.27 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tOvaries\n\n\t\t3.33 E-01\n\n\t\t4.99 E-01\n\n\t\t1.17 E+00\n\n\t\t1.66 E+00\n\n\t\t3.33 E+00\n\n\t\t9.99 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tPancreas\n\n\t\t7.90 E-02\n\n\t\t1.18 E-01\n\n\t\t2.76 E-01\n\n\t\t3.95 E-01\n\n\t\t7.90 E-01\n\n\t\t2.37 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tSkeletal muscle\n\n\t\t6.12 E-04\n\n\t\t9.17 E-04\n\n\t\t2.14 E-03\n\n\t\t3.06 E-03\n\n\t\t6.12 E-03\n\n\t\t1.83 E-02\n\n\n\n\t\tSkin\n\n\t\t1.02 E-01\n\n\t\t1.53 E-01\n\n\t\t3.58 E-01\n\n\t\t5.11 E-01\n\n\t\t1.02 E+00\n\n\t\t3.06 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tSpleen \n\n\t\t4.90 E-01\n\n\t\t7.36 E-01\n\n\t\t1.72 E+00\n\n\t\t2.45 E+00\n\n\t\t4.90 E+00\n\n\t\t1.47 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tStomach\n\n\t\t6.47 E-02\n\n\t\t9.70 E-02\n\n\t\t2.26 E-01\n\n\t\t3.23 E-01\n\n\t\t6.47 E-01\n\n\t\t1.94 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tThymus\n\n\t\t7.34 E-02\n\n\t\t1.10 E-01\n\n\t\t2.57 E-01\n\n\t\t3.67 E-01\n\n\t\t7.34 E-01\n\n\t\t2.20 E+00\n\n\n\n\t\tThyroids\n\n\t\t9.99 E-01\n\n\t\t1.50 E+00\n\n\t\t3.50 E+00\n\n\t\t5.00 E+00\n\n\t\t9.99 E+00\n\n\t\t3.00 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tUrinary bladder\n\n\t\t3.62 E-01\n\n\t\t5.44 E-01\n\n\t\t1.27 E+00\n\n\t\t1.81 E+00\n\n\t\t3.62 E+00\n\n\t\t1.09 E+01\n\n\n\n\t\tUterus\n\n\t\t1.51 E-02\n\n\t\t2.26 E-02\n\n\t\t5.28 E-02\n\n\t\t7.55 E-02\n\n\t\t1.51 E-01\n\n\t\t4.53 E-01\n\n\n\n\t\tEffective Dose\n\n\n(mSv/MBq)\n\n\t\t6.65 E-01\n\n\t\t9.98 E-01\n\n\t\t2.33 E+00\n\n\t\t3.33 E+00\n\n\t\t6.65 E+00\n\n\t\t1.99 E+1\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this product the effective dose to a 70 kg adult resulting from an intravenously injected activity of 1 GBq is 665 mSv.\n\n\n\n12. \nINSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS\n\nBefore use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an ionisation chamber. Yttrium (90Y) is a beta pure emitter. Activity measurements using an ionisation chamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and, therefore, should be performed only under geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated.\n\n\nUsual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected.\n\n\nThe vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding. The product should be aseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilised single use needle and syringe after disinfecting the stopper.\n\n\nAppropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with the requirements of Good\n\n\nPharmaceutical Manufacturing Practice, in order to maintain the sterility of Yttriga and to maintain sterility throughout the labelling procedures.\n\n\nThe administration of radioactive medicinal products creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.\n\n\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\n\n\nDetailed information on this product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency\n\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu\n\nANNEX II\n\n\nA.
