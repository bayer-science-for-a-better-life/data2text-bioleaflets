CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nMayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis \n\n(SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment with siponimod should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the \n\nmanagement of multiple sclerosis. \n\n \n\nBefore initiation of treatment, patients must be genotyped for CYP2C9 to determine their CYP2C9 \n\nmetaboliser status (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nIn patients with a CYP2C9*3*3 genotype, siponimod should not be used (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and \n\n5.2). \n\n \n\nIn patients with a CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotype, the recommended maintenance dose is 1 mg taken \n\nonce daily (four tablets of 0.25 mg) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nThe recommended maintenance dose of siponimod in all other CYP2C9 genotype patients is 2 mg. \n\n \n\nMayzent is taken once daily. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTreatment initiation \n\nTreatment has to be started with a titration pack that lasts for 5 days. Treatment starts with 0.25 mg \n\nonce daily on days 1 and 2, followed by once-daily doses of 0.5 mg on day 3, 0.75 mg on day 4, and \n\n1.25 mg on day 5, to reach the patient\u2019s prescribed maintenance dose of siponimod starting on day 6 \n\n(see Table 1). \n\n \n\nDuring the first 6 days of treatment initiation the recommended daily dose should be taken once daily \n\nin the morning with or without food. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Dose titration regimen to reach maintenance dosage \n \n\nTitration Titration dose Titration regimen Dose \n\nDay 1 0.25 mg 1 x 0.25 mg \n\nTITRATION \n\nDay 2 0.25 mg 1 x 0.25 mg \n\nDay 3 0.5 mg 2 x 0.25 mg \n\nDay 4 0.75 mg 3 x 0.25 mg \n\nDay 5 1.25 mg 5 x 0.25 mg \n\nDay 6 2 mg1 1 x 2 mg1 MAINTENANCE \n1 In patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotype, the recommended maintenance dose is 1 mg \n\ntaken once daily (4 x 0.25 mg) (see above and sections 4.4 and 5.2). Additional exposure of \n\n0.25 mg on day 5 does not compromise patient safety. \n\n \n\nMissed dose(s) during treatment initiation \n\nDuring the first 6 days of treatment, if a titration dose is missed on one day treatment needs to be \n\nre-initiated with a new titration pack. \n\n \n\nMissed dose after day 6 \n\nIf a dose is missed, the prescribed dose should be taken at the next scheduled time; the next dose \n\nshould not be doubled. \n\n \n\nRe-initiation of maintenance therapy after treatment interruption \n\nIf maintenance treatment is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, siponimod needs to be \n\nre-initiated with a new titration pack. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nSiponimod has not been studied in patients aged 65 years and above. Clinical studies included patients \n\nup to the age of 61 years. Siponimod should be used with caution in the elderly due to insufficient data \n\non safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nBased on clinical pharmacology studies, no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \n\nimpairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nSiponimod must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see \n\nsection 4.3). Although no dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic \n\nimpairment, caution should be exercised when initiating treatment in these patients (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of siponimod in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOral use. Siponimod is taken with or without food. \n\n \n\nThe film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with water. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to peanut, soya or any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n\n- Immunodeficiency syndrome. \n- History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. \n- Active malignancies. \n- Severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C). \n- Patients who in the previous 6 months had a myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina \n\npectoris, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure (requiring \n\ninpatient treatment), or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n- Patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) block, \nthird-degree AV block, sino-atrial heart block or sick-sinus syndrome, if they do not wear a \n\npacemaker (see section 4.4). \n\n- Patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3 (CYP2C9*3*3) genotype (poor metaboliser). \n- During pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (see \n\nsections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nRisk of infections \n\nA core pharmacodynamic effect of siponimod is a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral \n\nlymphocyte count to 20-30% of baseline values. This is due to the reversible sequestration of \n\nlymphocytes in lymphoid tissues (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe immune system effects of siponimod may increase the risk of infections (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nBefore initiating treatment, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within last 6 months or after \n\ndiscontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also recommended \n\nperiodically during treatment. Absolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l, if confirmed, should lead to \n\ndose reduction to 1 mg, because in clinical studies siponimod dose was reduced in patients with \n\nabsolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l. Confirmed absolute lymphocyte counts <0.2 x 109/l in a \n\npatient already receiving siponimod 1 mg should lead to interruption of siponimod therapy until the \n\nlevel reaches 0.6 x 109/l when re-initiation of siponimod can be considered. \n\n \n\nInitiation of treatment should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. \n\nBecause residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, \n\nmay persist for up to 3 to 4 weeks after discontinuation, vigilance for infection should be continued \n\nthroughout this period (see below section \u201cStopping siponimod therapy\u201d). \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to report symptoms of infection to their physician promptly. Effective \n\ndiagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in patients with symptoms of infection while \n\non therapy. Suspension of treatment with siponimod should be considered if a patient develops a \n\nserious infection. \n\n \n\nA case of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has been reported for siponimod. Cases of CM have been \n\nreported for another sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Patients with symptoms and \n\nsigns consistent with CM should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation. Siponimod treatment should \n\nbe suspended until CM has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be \n\ninitiated. \n\n \n\nNo cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported for siponimod in \n\nthe development programme; however, they have been reported for another S1P receptor modulator. \n\nPhysicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings \n\nthat may be suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, siponimod treatment should be suspended until \n\nPML has been excluded. \n\n \n\nCases of herpes viral infection (including one case of reactivation of varicella zoster virus [VZV] \n\ninfection leading to varicella zoster meningitis) have been reported in the siponimod development \n\nprogramme. Patients without a physician-confirmed history of varicella or without documentation of a \n\nfull course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before starting \n\nsiponimod (see below section \u201cVaccination\u201d). \n\n \n\nVaccination \n\nA full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine is recommended for antibody-negative patients \n\nprior to commencing treatment with siponimod, following which initiation of treatment should be \n\npostponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nThe use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided while patients are taking siponimod and for \n\n4 weeks after stopping treatment (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nVaccinations may be less effective if administered during siponimod treatment. Discontinuation of \n\ntreatment 1 week prior to planned vaccination until 4 weeks after is recommended. When stopping \n\nsiponimod therapy for vaccination, the possible return of disease activity should be considered (see \n\nbelow section \u201cStopping siponimod therapy\u201d). \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies \n\nAnti-neoplastic, immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) \n\nshould be co-administered with caution due to the risk of additive immune system effects during such \n\ntherapy (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMacular oedema \n\n \n\nMacular oedema with or without visual symptoms was more frequently reported on siponimod (1.8%) \n\nthan on placebo (0.2%) in the phase III clinical study (see section 4.8). The majority of cases occurred \n\nwithin the first 3-4 months of therapy. An ophthalmological evaluation is therefore recommended \n\n3-4 months after treatment initiation. As cases of macular oedema have also occurred on longer-term \n\ntreatment, patients should report visual disturbances at any time while on siponimod therapy and an \n\nevaluation of the fundus, including the macula, is recommended. \n\n \n\nSiponimod therapy should not be initiated in patients with macular oedema until resolution. \n\n \n\nSiponimod should be used with caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, uveitis or \n\nunderlying/co-existing retinal disease due to a potential increase in the risk of macular oedema (see \n\nsection 4.8). It is recommended that these patients should undergo an ophthalmological evaluation \n\nprior to initiating therapy and regularly while receiving siponimod therapy to detect macular oedema. \n\n \n\nContinuation of siponimod therapy in patients with macular oedema has not been evaluated. It is \n\nrecommended that siponimod be discontinued if a patient develops macular oedema. A decision on \n\nwhether or not siponimod should be re-initiated after resolution needs to take into account the \n\npotential benefits and risks for the individual patient. \n\n \n\nBradyarrhythmia \n\n \n\nReduction in heart rate \n\nInitiation of siponimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate (see sections 4.8 and 5.1), \n\nand a titration scheme to reach the maintenance dose on day 6 is therefore applied at the start of \n\ntreatment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nAfter the first titration dose, the heart rate decrease starts within one hour and the day 1 decline is \n\nmaximal at approximately 3 to 4 hours. With continued up-titration, further heart rate decreases are \n\nseen on subsequent days, with maximal decrease from day 1 (baseline) reached on day 5 to 6. The \n\nhighest daily post-dose decrease in absolute hourly mean heart rate is observed on day 1, with the \n\npulse declining on average 5 to 6 beats per minute (bpm). Post-dose declines on the following days are \n\nless pronounced. With continued dosing heart rate starts increasing after day 6 and reaches placebo \n\nlevels within 10 days after treatment initiation. \n\n \n\nHeart rates below 40 bpm were rarely observed. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally \n\nasymptomatic. A few patients experienced mild to moderate symptoms including dizziness and \n\nnon-cardiac chest pain, which resolved within 24 hours without intervention (see section 4.8). If \n\nnecessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by parenteral doses of \n\natropine or isoprenaline. \n\n \n\nAtrioventricular conduction \n\nInitiation of siponimod treatment has been associated with transient atrioventricular conduction delays \n\nthat follow a similar temporal pattern to the observed decrease in heart rate during dose titration. The \n\natrioventricular conduction delays manifested in most of the cases as first-degree atrioventricular (AV) \n\nblocks (prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, second-degree AV blocks, \n\nusually Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), have been observed in less than 1.7% of patients at the time of \n\ntreatment initiation. The conduction abnormalities typically were transient, asymptomatic, resolved \n\nwithin 24 hours and did not require discontinuation of treatment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTreatment initiation recommendation in patients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions \n\nAs a precautionary measure, patients with the following cardiac conditions should be observed for a \n\nperiod of 6 hours after the first dose of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia (see also \n\nsection 4.3): \n\n- sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), \n- history of first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, \n- history of myocardial infarction, or \n- history of heart failure (patients with NYHA class I and II). \nIn these patients, it is recommended that an electrocardiogram (ECG) is obtained prior to dosing and at \n\nthe end of the observation period. If post-dose bradyarrhythmia or conduction-related symptoms occur \n\nor if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc \u2265500 msec, \n\nappropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the symptoms/findings \n\nhave resolved. If pharmacological treatment is required, monitoring should be continued overnight and \n\n6-hour monitoring should be repeated after the second dose. \n\n \n\nDue to the risk of serious cardiac rhythm disturbances or significant bradycardia, siponimod should \n\nnot be used in patients with: \n\n- history of symptomatic bradycardia or recurrent syncope, \n- uncontrolled hypertension, or \n- severe untreated sleep apnoea. \nIn such patients, treatment with siponimod should be considered only if the anticipated benefits \n\noutweigh the potential risks, and advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of \n\ntreatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy. \n\n \n\nA thorough QT study demonstrated no significant direct QT-prolonging effect and siponimod is not \n\nassociated with an arrhythmogenic potential related to QT prolongation. Initiation of treatment may \n\nresult in decreased heart rate and indirect prolongation of the QT interval during the titration phase. \n\nSiponimod was not studied in patients with significant QT prolongation (QTc >500 msec) or who \n\nwere treated with QT-prolonging medicinal products. If treatment with siponimod is considered in \n\npatients with pre-existing significant QT prolongation or who are already being treated with \n\nQT-prolonging medicinal products with known arrhythmogenic properties, advice from a cardiologist \n\nshould be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring \n\nstrategy during treatment initiation. \n\n \n\nSiponimod has not been studied in patients with arrhythmias requiring treatment with class Ia (e.g. \n\nquinidine, procainamide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\nClass Ia and class III antiarrhythmic medicinal products have been associated with cases of torsades de \n\npointes in patients with bradycardia. Since initiation of treatment results in decreased heart rate, \n\nsiponimod should not be used concomitantly with these medicinal products during treatment initiation. \n\n \n\nExperience is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with heart-rate-lowering calcium \n\nchannel blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) or other substances that may decrease heart rate \n\n(e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) as these medicinal products were not studied in patients receiving \n\nsiponimod in clinical studies. Concomitant use of these substances during treatment initiation may be \n\nassociated with severe bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart \n\nrate, treatment with siponimod should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently \n\ntreated with these substances (see section 4.5). In such patients, treatment with siponimod should be \n\nconsidered only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks. \n\n \n\nIf concomitant treatment with one of the above substances is considered during initiation of treatment \n\nwith siponimod, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to a \n\nnon-heart-rate-lowering medicinal product or appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation. \n\n \n\nBradyarrhythmic effects are more pronounced when siponimod is added to beta-blocker therapy. For \n\npatients receiving a stable dose of beta blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before \n\nintroducing treatment. If the resting heart rate is >50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, \n\nsiponimod can be introduced. If resting heart rate is \u226450 bpm, then beta-blocker treatment should be \n\n\n\n8 \n\ninterrupted until the baseline heart rate is >50 bpm. Treatment with siponimod can then be initiated \n\nand treatment with beta blocker can be re-initiated after siponimod has been up-titrated to the target \n\nmaintenance dose (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLiver function \n\n \n\nRecent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available before \n\ninitiation of treatment with siponimod. \n\n \n\nIn the phase III clinical study, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \n\nthree times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was observed in 5.6% of patients treated with siponimod \n\n2 mg compared to 1.5% of patients who received placebo (see section 4.8). In clinical studies \n\ntreatment was discontinued if the elevation exceeded a 3-fold increase and the patient showed \n\nsymptoms related to hepatic function or if the elevation exceeded a 5-fold increase. In the phase III \n\nclinical study, 1% of all discontinuations met one of these criteria. \n\n \n\nPatients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction should have liver enzymes checked \n\nand siponimod should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Resumption of therapy \nwill be dependent on whether or not another cause of liver injury is determined and on the benefits to \n\nthe patient of resuming therapy versus the risks of recurrence of liver dysfunction. \n\n \n\nAlthough there are no data to establish that patients with pre-existing liver disease are at increased risk \n\nof developing elevated liver function test values when taking siponimod, caution should be exercised \n\nin patients with a history of significant liver disease. \n\n \n\nCutaneous neoplasms \n\n \n\nIn study A2304, basal cell carcinoma was the most common neoplasm and was reported with a \n\nsimiliar incidence in the siponimod 2 mg (1.01%, 12 patients) and placebo (1.23%, 7 patients) groups. \n\nHowever, other skin malignancies, including melanoma, have also been reported in patients treated \n\nwith siponimod and in patients on long-term therapy with another S1P modulator. Patients treated with \n\nsiponimod should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. These patients should \n\nnot receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy. \n\n \n\nUnexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs \n\n \n\nRare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported for another \n\nsphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Such events have not been reported for siponimod \nin the development programme. However, should a patient on siponimod treatment develop any \nunexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (e.g. cognitive deficits, behavioural changes, \n\ncortical visual disturbances or any other neurological cortical symptoms/signs or any symptom/sign \n\nsuggestive of an increase in intracranial pressure) or accelerated neurological deterioration, a complete \n\nphysical and neurological examination should promptly be scheduled and MRI should be considered. \n\n \n\nPrior treatment with immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies \n\n \n\nWhen switching from other disease-modifying therapies, the half-life and mode of action of the other \n\ntherapy must be considered to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time minimising the \n\nrisk of disease reactivation. A peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) is recommended prior to initiating \n\nsiponimod to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. \n\n \n\nDue to the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects described in its \n\nproduct information, initiating treatment with siponimod after alemtuzumab is not recommended. \n\n \n\nSiponimod can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of beta interferon or glatiramer \n\nacetate. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nBlood pressure effects \n\n \n\nPatients with hypertension uncontrolled by medication were excluded from participation in clinical \n\nstudies and special care is indicated if patients with uncontrolled hypertension are treated with \n\nsiponimod. \n \n\nHypertension was more frequently reported in patients on siponimod (12.6%) than in those given \n\nplacebo (9.0%) in the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS. Treatment with siponimod \n\nresulted in an increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure starting early after treatment initiation, \n\nreaching maximum effect after approximately 6 months of treatment (systolic 3 mmHg, diastolic \n\n1.2 mmHg) and staying stable thereafter. The effect persisted with continued treatment. \n\n \n\nBlood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with siponimod. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 genotype \n\n \n\nBefore initiation of treatment with siponimod, patients should be genotyped for CYP2C9 to determine \n\ntheir CYP2C9 metaboliser status (see section 4.2). Patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3 \n\n(CYP2C9*3*3 genotype: approximately 0.3 to 0.4% of the population) should not be treated with \n\nsiponimod. Use of siponimod in these patients results in substantially elevated siponimod plasma \n\nlevels. The recommended maintenance dose is 1 mg daily in patients with a CYP2C9*2*3 genotype \n\n(1.4-1.7% of the population) and in patients with a *1*3 genotype (9-12% of the population) to avoid \n\nincreased exposure to siponimod (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nDue to risk for the foetus, siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of \n\nchildbearing potential not using effective contraception. Before initiation of treatment, women of \n\nchildbearing potential must be informed of this risk to the foetus, must have a negative pregnancy test \n\nand must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after treatment \n\ndiscontinuation (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nStopping siponimod therapy \n\n \n\nSevere exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after \n\ndiscontinuation of another S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease \n\nafter stopping siponimod treatment should be considered. Patients should be observed for relevant \n\nsigns of possible severe exacerbation or return of high disease activity upon siponimod discontinuation \n\nand appropriate treatment should be instituted as required. \n\n \n\nAfter siponimod therapy has been stopped, siponimod remains in the blood for up to 10 days. Starting \n\nother therapies during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to siponimod. \n\n \n\nIn the vast majority (90%) of SPMS patients, lymphocyte counts return to the normal range within \n\n10 days of stopping therapy. However, residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on \n\nperipheral lymphocyte count, may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after the last dose. Use of \n\nimmunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and \n\ntherefore caution should be exercised for 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose. \n\n \n\nInterference with haematological testing \n\n \n\nSince siponimod reduces blood lymphocyte counts via re-distribution in secondary lymphoid organs, \n\nperipheral blood lymphocyte counts cannot be utilised to evaluate the lymphocyte subset status of a \n\npatient treated with siponimod. Laboratory tests involving the use of circulating mononuclear cells \n\nrequire larger blood volumes due to reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nExcipients \n\n \n\nThe tablets contain soya lecithin. Patients who are hypersensitive to peanut or soya should not take \n\nsiponimod (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nAntineoplastic, immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies \n\n \n\nSiponimod has not been studied in combination with antineoplastic, immune-modulating or \n\nimmunosuppressive therapies. Caution should be exercised during concomitant administration due to \n\nthe risk of additive immune effects during such therapy and in the weeks after administration of any of \n\nthese medicinal products is stopped (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDue to the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects described in its \n\nproduct information, initiating treatment with siponimod after alemtuzmab is not recommended unless \n\nthe benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient (see section  4.4). \n\n \n\nAnti-arrhythmic medicinal products, QT-prolonging medicinal products, medicinal products that may \n\ndecrease heart rate \n\n \n\nDuring treatment initiation siponimod should not be concomitantly used in patients receiving class Ia \n\n(e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) anti-arrhythmic medicinal \n\nproducts, QT-prolonging medicinal products with known arrhythmogenic properties, \n\nheart-rate-lowering calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) or other substances that \n\nmay decrease heart rate (e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) because of the potential additive effects on heart \n\nrate (see section 4.4). No data are available for concomitant use of these medicinal products with \n\nsiponimod. Concomitant use of these substances during treatment initiation may be associated with \n\nsevere bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart rate, treatment \n\nwith siponimod should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with these \n\nsubstances (see section 4.4). If treatment with siponimod is considered, advice from a cardiologist \n\nshould be sought regarding the switch to non-heart-rate-lowering medicinal products or appropriate \n\nmonitoring for treatment initiation. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when siponimod is initiated in patients receiving beta blockers due to the \n\nadditive effects on lowering heart rate (see section 4.4). Beta-blocker treatment can be initiated in \n\npatients receiving stable doses of siponimod. \n\n \n\nThe negative chronotropic effect of co-administration of siponimod and propranolol was evaluated in \n\na dedicated pharmacodynamic/safety study. The addition of propranolol on top of siponimod \n\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic steady state had less pronounced negative chronotropic effects \n\n(less than additive) in comparison to addition of siponimod on top of propranolol \n\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic steady state (additive HR effect). \n\n \n\nVaccination \n\n \n\nThe use of live attenuated vaccines may carry the risk of infection and should therefore be avoided \n\nduring siponimod treatment and for up to 4 weeks after treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDuring and for up to 4 weeks after treatment with siponimod vaccinations may be less effective. The \n\nefficacy of vaccination is not considered to be compromised if siponimod treatment is paused 1 week \n\nprior to vaccination until 4 weeks after (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nPotential of other medicinal products to affect siponimod pharmacokinetics \n\n \n\nSiponimod is metabolised primarily by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (79.3%) and to a lesser \n\nextent by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (18.5%). CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme and the \n\ndrug-drug interaction (DDI) effect in the presence of CYP3A or CYP2C9 perpetrator drugs is \n\npredicted to be dependent on the CYP2C9 genotype. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors \n\nBecause of a significant increase in exposure to siponimod, concomitant use of siponimod and \n\nmedicinal products that cause moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibition is not \n\nrecommended. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of a moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 dual \n\ninhibitor (e.g. fluconazole) or a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor in combination with a separate moderate \n\nor strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. \n\n \n\nThe co-administration of fluconazole (moderate CYP2C9/strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) 200 mg daily at \n\nsteady state and a single dose of siponimod 4 mg in healthy volunteers with a CYP2C9*1*1 genotype \n\nled to a 2-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of siponimod. According to evaluation of \n\nthe drug interaction potential using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, a \n\nmaximum of a 2-fold increase in the AUC of siponimod is predicted across genotypes with any type of \n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitors except for patients with a CYP2C9*2*2 genotype. In CYP2C9*2*2 \n\npatients, a 2.7-fold increase in the AUC of siponimod is expected in the presence of moderate \n\nCYP2C9/CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inducers \n\nSiponimod may be combined with most types of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inducers. However, because \n\nof an expected reduction in siponimod exposure, the appropriateness and possible benefit of the \n\ntreatment should be considered when siponimod is combined: \n\n- with strong CYP3A4/moderate CYP2C9 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) in all patients regardless \nof genotype \n\n- with moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. modafinil) in patients with a CYP2C9*1*3 or *2*3 \ngenotype. \n\n \n\nA significant reduction of siponimod exposure (by up to 76% and 51%, respectively) is expected \n\nunder these conditions according to evaluation of the drug interaction potential using PBPK \n\nmodelling. The co-administration of siponimod 2 mg daily in the presence of 600 mg daily doses of \n\nrifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9 inducer) decreased siponimod AUCtau,ss and Cmax,ss \n\nby 57% and 45%, respectively, in CY2C9*1*1 subjects. \n\n \n\nOral contraceptives \n\n \n\nCo-administration with siponimod did not reveal clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics \n\nand pharmacodynamics of the combined ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel oral contraceptive. \n\nTherefore the efficacy of the investigated oral contraceptive was maintained under siponimod \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestagens, \n\nhowever an effect of siponimod on the efficacy of oral contraceptives is not expected. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in females \n\n \n\nSiponimod is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception \n\n(see section 4.3). Therefore, before initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential a \n\nnegative pregnancy test result must be available and counselling should be provided regarding serious \n\nrisk to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment \n\nand for at least ten days following the last dose of siponimod (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nSpecific measures are also included in the Physician Education Pack. These measures must be \n\nimplemented before siponimod is prescribed to female patients and during treatment. \n\n \n\nWhen stopping siponimod therapy for planning a pregnancy, the possible return of disease activity \n\nshould be considered (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data available from the use of siponimod in pregnant women. \n\nAnimal studies have demonstrated siponimod-induced embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity in rats and \n\nrabbits and teratogenicity in rats, including embryo-foetal deaths and skeletal or visceral \n\nmalformations at exposure levels comparable to the human exposure at the daily dose of 2 mg (see \n\nsection 5.3). In addition, clinical experience with another sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator \n\nindicated a 2-fold higher risk of major congenital malformations when administered during pregnancy \n\ncompared with the rate observed in the general population. \n\n \n\nConsequently, siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Siponimod should be \n\nstopped at least 10 days before a pregnancy is planned (see section 4.4). If a woman becomes pregnant \n\nwhile on treatment, siponimod must be discontinued. Medical advice should be given regarding the \n\nrisk of harmful effects to the foetus associated with treatment and ultrasonography examinations \n\nshould be performed. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether siponimod or its major metabolites are excreted in human milk. Siponimod and \n\nits metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats. Siponimod should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effect of siponimod on human fertility has not been evaluated. Siponimod had no effect on male \n\nreproductive organs in rats and monkeys or on fertility parameters in rats. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nSiponimod has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness \n\nmay occasionally occur when initiating therapy with siponimod. Therefore, patients should not drive \n\nor use machines during the first day of treatment initiation with siponimod (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse drug reactions are headache (15%) and hypertension (12.6%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nWithin each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most \n\nfrequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug \n\nreaction is based on the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). \n\n \n\nTable 2 Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nCommon Herpes zoster \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) \n\nCommon Melanocytic naevus \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon Lymphopenia \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery common Headache \n\nCommon Dizziness \n\nSeizure \n\nTremor \n\nEye disorders \n\nCommon Macular oedema \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Bradycardia \n\nAtrioventricular block (first and second degree) \n\nVascular disorders \n\nVery common Hypertension \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Nausea \n\nDiarrhoea \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Pain in extremity \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nCommon Oedema peripheral \n\nAsthenia \n\nInvestigations \n\nVery common Liver function test increased \n\nCommon Pulmonary function test decreased \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nIn the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS the overall rate of infections was comparable \n\nbetween the patients on siponimod and those on placebo (49.0% versus 49.1%, respectively). \n\nHowever, an increase in the rate of herpes zoster infections was reported on siponimod (2.5%) \n\ncompared to placebo (0.7%). In the extension part of the phase III clinical study, a case of \n\ncryptococcal meningitis (CM) has been reported (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nMacular oedema \n\nMacular oedema was more frequently reported in patients receiving siponimod (1.8%) than in those \n\ngiven placebo (0.2%). Although the majority of cases occurred within 3 to 4 months of commencing \n\nsiponimod, cases were also reported in patients treated with siponimod for more than 6 months (see \n\nsection 4.4). Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were \n\nasymptomatic and diagnosed on routine ophthalmological examination. The macular oedema \n\ngenerally improved or resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of treatment. The risk of \n\nrecurrence after re-challenge has not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nBradyarrhythmia \n\nInitiation of siponimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be \n\nassociated with atrioventricular conduction delays (see section 4.4). Bradycardia was reported in 6.2% \n\nof patients treated with siponimod compared to 3.1% on placebo and AV block in 1.7% of patients \n\ntreated with siponimod compared to 0.7% on placebo (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe maximum decline in heart rate is seen in the first 6 hours post-dose. \n\n \n\nA transient, dose-dependent decrease in heart rate was observed during the initial dosing phase and \n\nplateaued at doses \u22655 mg. Bradyarrhythmic events (AV blocks and sinus pauses) were detected with a \n\nhigher incidence under siponimod treatment compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nMost AV blocks and sinus pauses occurred above the therapeutic dose of 2 mg, with notably higher \n\nincidence under non-titrated conditions compared to dose titration conditions. \n\n \n\nThe decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by atropine or isoprenaline. \n\n \n\nLiver function tests \n\nIncreased hepatic enzymes (mostly ALT elevation) have been reported in MS patients treated with \n\nsiponimod. In the phase III study in patients with SPMS, liver function test increases were more \n\nfrequently observed in patients on siponimod (11.3%) than in those on placebo (3.1%), mainly due to \n\nliver transaminase (ALT/AST) and GGT elevations. The majority of elevations occurred within \n\n6 months of starting treatment. ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 1 month after \n\ndiscontinuation of siponimod (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBlood pressure \n\nHypertension was more frequently reported in patients on siponimod (12.6%) than in those given \n\nplacebo (9.0%) in the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS. Treatment with siponimod \n\nresulted in an increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure starting early after treatment initiation, \n\nreaching maximum effect after approximately 6 months of treatment (systolic 3 mmHg, diastolic \n\n1.2 mmHg) and staying stable thereafter. The effect persisted with continued treatment. \n\n \n\nSeizures \n\nSeizures were reported in 1.7% of patients treated with siponimod compared to 0.4% on placebo in the \n\nphase III clinical study in patients with SPMS. \n\n \n\nRespiratory effects \n\nMinor reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and in the diffusing capacity of the \n\nlung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values were observed with siponimod treatment. At months 3 and \n\n6 of treatment in the phase III clinical study in patients with SPMS, mean changes from baseline in \n\nFEV1 in the siponimod group were -0.1 L at each time point, with no change in the placebo group. \n\nThese observations were slightly higher (approximately 0.15 L mean change from baseline in FEV1) in \n\npatients with respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma \n\ntreated with siponimod. On chronic treatment, this reduction did not translate into clinically significant \n\nadverse events and was not associated with an increase in reports of cough or dyspnoea (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the single maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 25 mg based upon the \n\noccurrence of symptomatic bradycardia after single doses of 75 mg. A few subjects received \n\nunintended doses of up to 200 mg daily for 3 to 4 days and experienced asymptomatic mild to \n\nmoderate transient elevations of liver function tests. \n\n \n\nOne patient (with a history of depression) who took 84 mg siponimod experienced a slight elevation in \n\nliver transaminases. \n\n \n\nIf the overdose constitutes first exposure to siponimod or occurs during the dose titration phase of \n\nsiponimod it is important to observe for signs and symptoms of bradycardia, which could include \n\novernight monitoring. Regular measurements of pulse rate and blood pressure are required and \n\nelectrocardiograms should be performed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote to siponimod available. Neither dialysis nor plasma exchange would \n\nresult in meaningful removal of siponimod from the body. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: \n\nL04AA42 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nSiponimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Siponimod binds selectively to \n\ntwo out of five G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for S1P, namely S1P1 and S1P5. By acting as a \n\nfunctional antagonist on S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes, siponimod prevents egress from lymph \n\nnodes. This reduces the recirculation of T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) to limit central \n\ninflammation. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nReduction of the peripheral blood lymphocytes \n\nSiponimod induces a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral blood lymphocyte count within \n\n6 hours of the first dose, due to the reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. \n\n \n\nWith continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continues to decrease, reaching a nadir median \n\n(90% CI) lymphocyte count of approximately 0.560 (0.271-1.08) cells/nL in a typical CYP2C9*1*1 or \n\n*1*2 non-Japanese SPMS patient, corresponding to 20-30% of baseline. Low lymphocyte counts are \n\nmaintained with daily dosing. \n\n \n\nIn the vast majority (90%) of SPMS patients, lymphocyte counts return to the normal range within \n\n10 days of stopping therapy. After stopping siponimod treatment residual lowering effects on \n\nperipheral lymphocyte count may persist for up to 3-4 weeks after the last dose. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nHeart rate and rhythm \n\nSiponimod causes a transient reduction in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction on treatment \n\ninitiation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8), which is mechanistically related to the activation of \n\nG-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels via S1P1 receptor stimulation \n\nleading to cellular hyperpolarisation and reduced excitability. Due to its functional antagonism at S1P1 \n\nreceptors, initial titration of siponimod successively desensitises GIRK channels until the maintenance \n\ndose is reached. \n\n \n\nPotential to prolong the QT interval \n\nThe effects of therapeutic (2 mg) and supratherapeutic (10 mg) doses of siponimod on cardiac \n\nrepolarisation were investigated in a thorough QT study. The results did not suggest an \n\narrhythmogenic potential related to QT prolongation with siponimod. Siponimod increased the \n\nplacebo-corrected baseline-adjusted mean QTcF (\u0394\u0394QTcF) by more than 5 ms, with a maximum \n\nmean effect of 7.8 ms (2 mg) and 7.2 ms (10 mg), respectively, at 3 h post-dose. The upper bound of \n\nthe one-sided 95% CI for the \u0394\u0394QTcF at all time points remained below 10 ms. Categorical analysis \n\nrevealed no treatment-emergent QTc values above 480 ms, no QTc increases from baseline of more \n\nthan 60 ms and no corrected or uncorrected QT/QTc value exceeded 500 ms. \n\n \n\nPulmonary function \n\nSiponimod treatment with single or multiple doses for 28 days is not associated with clinically \n\nrelevant increases in airway resistance as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \n\nand forced expiratory flow (FEF) during expiration of 25 to 75% of the forced vital capacity \n\n(FEF25-75%). A slight trend of reduced FEV1 was detected at non-therapeutic single doses (>10 mg). \n\nMultiple doses of siponimod were associated with mild to moderate changes in FEV1 and FEF25-75% \n\nwhich were not dose- and daytime-dependent and were not associated with any clinical signs of \n\nincreased airway resistance. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of siponimod has been investigated in a phase III study evaluating once-daily doses of \n\n2 mg in patients with SPMS. \n\n \n\nStudy A2304 (EXPAND) in SPMS \n\nStudy A2304 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event and follow-up duration \n\ndriven, phase III study in patients with SPMS who had documented evidence of progression in the \n\nprior 2 years in the absence or independent of relapses, no evidence of relapse in the 3 months prior to \n\nstudy enrolment and with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.0 to 6.5 at \n\nstudy entry. The median EDSS was 6.0 at baseline. Patients above 61 years of age were not included. \n\nWith regard to disease activity, features characteristic of inflammatory activity in SPMS can be \n\nrelapse- or imaging-related (i.e. Gd-enhancing T1 lesions or active [new or enlarging] T2 lesions). \n\n \n\nPatients were randomised 2:1 to receive either once-daily siponimod 2 mg or placebo. Clinical \n\nevaluations were performed at screening and every 3 months and at the time of relapse. MRI \n\nevaluations were performed at screening and every 12 months. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) \n\ndetermined as at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5 point increase for patients with \n\nbaseline EDSS of 5.5 or more) sustained for 3 months. Key secondary endpoints were time to 3-month \n\nconfirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test (T25W) and change \n\nfrom baseline in T2 lesion volume. Additional secondary endpoints included time to 6-month CDP, \n\npercent brain volume change and measures of inflammatory disease activity (annualised relapse rate, \n\nMRI lesions). Change in cognitive processing speed on Symbol Digit Modality Test score was an \n\nexploratory endpoint. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n17 \n\nStudy duration was variable for individual patients (median study duration was 21 months, \n\nrange: 1 day to 37 months). \n\n \n\nThe study involved randomisation of 1,651 patients to either siponimod 2 mg (N=1,105) or placebo \n\n(N=546); 82% of patients treated with siponimod and 78% of placebo-treated patients completed the \n\nstudy. Median age was 49 years, median disease duration was 16 years and median EDSS score was \n\n6.0 at baseline. 64% of patients had no relapses in the 2 years prior to study entry and 76% had no \n\ngadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions on their baseline MRI scan. 78% of patients had been previously \n\ntreated with a therapy for their MS. \n\n \n\nTime to onset of 3-month and 6-month CDP was significantly delayed for siponimod, with reduction \n\nin risk of 3-month CDP by 21% compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, p=0.0134) and \n\nreduction in risk of 6-month CDP by 26% compared to placebo (HR 0.74, p=0.0058). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Patients with 3- and 6-month CDP based on EDSS-Kaplan-Meier curves (full \n\nanalysis set, study A2304) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNumber of patients at risk \n\nPlacebo (N=546) \n\nP\ne\n\nrc\nen\n\nta\nge\n\n o\nf \n\nsu\nb\n\nje\nct\n\ns \nw\n\nit\nh\n\n 3\n-m\n\no\nn\n\nth\n C\n\nD\nP\n \n\nP\ne\n\nrc\nen\n\nta\nge\n\n o\nf \n\nsu\nb\n\nje\nct\n\ns \nw\n\nit\nh\n\n 6\n-m\n\no\nn\n\nth\n C\n\nD\nP\n \n\nSiponimod (N=1099) \n\nStudy month \n\nSiponimod \nPlacebo \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 \n\nHazard ratio: 0.79, p=0.0134; (95% Cl: 0.65, \n0.95); risk reduction: 21% \n\nHazard ratio: 0.74, p=0.0058; (95% \nCl: 0.60, 0.92); risk reduction: 26% \n\nStudy month \n\n1099 947 781 499 289 101 4 0 \n546 463 352 223 124 35 0 0 \n\nNumber of patients at risk \nSiponimod \n\nPlacebo \n1099 960 811 525 306 106 5 0 \n\n546 473 361 230 128 37 1 0 \n\nTime to 3-month CDP versus placebo \n(Primary endpoint)  \n\nTime to 6-month CDP versus placebo \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTable 3 Clinical and MRI results of study A2304 \n\n \n\nEndpoints A2304 (EXPAND) \n\nSiponimod 2 mg \n\n(n=1,099) \n\nPlacebo \n\n(n=546) \n\nClinical endpoints \n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: \n\nProportion of patients with 3-month confirmed \n\ndisability progression (primary endpoint) \n\n26.3% 31.7% \n\nRisk reduction1 21% (p=0.0134) \n\nProportion of patients with 3-month confirmed \n\n20% increase in timed 25-foot walk test \n\n39.7% 41.4% \n\nRisk reduction1 6% (p=0.4398) \n\nProportion of patients with 6-month confirmed \n\ndisability progression \n\n19.9% 25.5% \n\nRisk reduction1 26% [(p=0.0058)]6 \n\nAnnualised relapse rate (ARR) 0.071 0.152 \n\nRate reduction2 55% [(p<0.0001)]6 \n\nMRI endpoints \n\nChange from baseline in T2 lesion volume \n\n(mm3)3 \n\n+184 mm3 +879 mm3 \n\nDifference in T2 lesion volume change -695 mm3 (p<0.0001)7 \n\nPercentage brain volume change relative to \n\nbaseline (95% CI)3 \n\n-0.497% -0.649% \n\nDifference in percentage brain volume change 0.152% [(p=0.0002)]6 \n\nAverage cumulative number of Gd-enhancing T1 \n\nweighted lesions (95% CI)4 \n\n0.081 0.596 \n\nRate reduction 86% [(p<0.0001)]6 \n\nProportion of patients with 4-point worsening in \n\nSymbol Digit Modality Test5 \n\n16.0% 20.9% \n\nRisk reduction1 25% [(p=0.0163)]6 \n1 From Cox modelling for time to progression \n2 From a model for recurrent events \n3 Average over month 12 and month 24 \n4 Up to month 24 \n5 Confirmed at 6 months \n6 [Nominal p-value for endpoints not included in the hierarchical testing and not adjusted for \n\nmultiplicity] \n7 Non-confirmatory p-value; hierarchical testing procedure terminated before reaching endpoint \n\n \n\nResults from the study showed a variable but consistent risk reduction in the time to 3- and 6-month \n\nCDP with siponimod compared to placebo in subgroups defined based on gender, age, pre-study \n\nrelapse activity, baseline MRI disease activity, disease duration and disability levels at baseline. \n\n \n\nIn the subgroup of patients (n=779) with active disease (defined as patients with relapse in the 2 years \n\nprior to the study and/or presence of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline) the baseline characteristics \n\nwere similar to the overall population.

The differences in T2 lesion volume change \n\n\n\n19 \n\nand in percentage of brain volume change (average over months 12 and 24) compared to placebo \n\nwere -1163 mm3 (95% CI: -1484, -843 mm3) and 0.141% (95% CI: 0.020, 0.261%), respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 2 Patients with 3- and 6-month CDP based on EDSS-Kaplan-Meier curves \u2013 \n\nSubgroup with active SPMS (full analysis set, study A2304) \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the subgroup of patients (n=827) without signs and symptoms of disease activity (defined as \n\npatients without relapse in the 2 years prior to the study and without presence of Gd-enhancing T1 \n\nlesions at baseline), effects on 3-month and 6-month CDP were small (risk reductions were 7% and \n\n13%, respectively). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nsiponimod in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multiple sclerosis \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nThe time (Tmax) to reach maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) after multiple oral administration of \n\nsiponimod is about 4 hours (range: 2 to 12 hours). Siponimod absorption is extensive (\u226570%, based on \n\nthe amount of radioactivity excreted in urine and the amount of metabolites in faeces extrapolated to \n\ninfinity). The absolute oral bioavailability of siponimod is approximately 84%. For 2 mg siponimod \n\ngiven once daily over 10 days, a mean Cmax of 30.4 ng/ml and mean AUCtau of 558 h*ng/ml were \n\nobserved on day 10. Steady state was reached after approximately 6 days of multiple once-daily \n\nadministration of siponimod. \n\n \n\nDespite a delay in Tmax to 8 hours after a single dose, food intake had no effect on the systemic \n\nexposure of siponimod (Cmax and AUC), therefore siponimod may be taken without regard to meals \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNumber of patients at risk \n\nPlacebo (N=263) \n\nP\ne\n\nrc\nen\n\nta\nge\n\n o\nf \n\np\nat\n\nie\nn\n\nts\n w\n\nit\nh\n\n 3\n-m\n\no\nn\n\nth\n C\n\nD\nP\n \n\nP\ne\n\nrc\nen\n\nta\nge\n\n o\nf \n\np\nat\n\nie\nn\n\nts\n w\n\nit\nh\n\n 6\n-m\n\no\nn\n\nth\n C\n\nD\nP\n \n\nSiponimod (N=516) \n\nStudy month \n\nSiponimod \nPlacebo \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 \n\nStudy month \n\n516 439 376 245 149 48 1 0 \n263 221 164 112 68 19 0 0 \n\nNumber of patients at risk \nSiponimod \n\nPlacebo \n\nTime to 3-month CDP versus placebo \n(Primary endpoint) \n\nTime to 6-month CDP versus placebo \n\n42 \n\n516 447 391 258 156 51 1 0 \n263 225 171 115 68 20 0 0 \n\n50 \n\nHazard ratio: 0.69 (95% Cl: 0.53, \n\n0.91); risk reduction: 31% \n\nHazard ratio: 0.63 (95% Cl: 0.47, \n\n0.86); risk reduction: 37% \n\n\n\n20 \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nSiponimod is distributed to body tissues with a moderate mean volume of distribution of 124 litres. \n\nThe siponimod fraction found in plasma is 68% in humans. Siponimod readily crosses the blood-brain \n\nbarrier. Protein binding of siponimod is >99.9% in healthy subjects and in patients with hepatic or \n\nrenal impairment. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nSiponimod is extensively metabolised, mainly by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) (79.3%), and to a \n\nlesser extent by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (18.5%). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacological activity of the main metabolites M3 and M17 is not expected to contribute to the \n\nclinical effect and the safety of siponimod in humans. \n\n \n\nIn vitro investigations indicated that siponimod and its major systemic metabolites M3 and M17 do \n\nnot show any clinically relevant drug-drug interaction potential at the therapeutic dose of 2 mg once \n\ndaily for all investigated CYP enzymes and transporters, and do not necessitate clinical investigation. \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 is polymorphic and the genotype influences the fractional contributions of the two oxidative \n\nmetabolism pathways to overall elimination. PBPK modelling indicates a differential CYP2C9 \n\ngenotype-dependent inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 pathways. With decreased CYP2C9 \n\nmetabolic activity in the respective genotypes, a larger effect of the CYP3A4 perpetrators on \n\nsiponimod exposure is anticipated (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAn apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of 3.11 l/h was estimated in MS patients. The apparent \n\nelimination half-life of siponimod is approximately 30 hours. \n\n \n\nSiponimod is eliminated from the systemic circulation mainly due to metabolism and subsequent \n\nbiliary/faecal excretion. Unchanged siponimod was not detected in urine. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\n \n\nSiponimod concentration increases in an apparent dose proportional manner after multiple once-daily \n\ndoses of siponimod 0.3 mg to 20 mg. \n\n \n\nSteady-state plasma concentrations are reached after approximately 6 days of once-daily dosing and \n\nsteady-state levels are approximately 2- to 3-fold greater than after the initial dose. An up-titration \n\nregimen is used to reach the clinically therapeutic dose of 2 mg siponimod after 6 days and \n\n4 additional days of dosing are required to reach the steady-state plasma concentrations. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in specific groups or special populations \n\n \n\nCYP2C9 genotype \n\nThe CYP2C9 genotype influences siponimod CL/F. Two population pharmacokinetic analyses \n\nindicated that CYP2C9*1*1 and *1*2 subjects behave as extensive metabolisers, *2*2 and *1*3 \n\nsubjects as intermediate metabolisers and *2*3 and *3*3 subjects as poor metabolisers. Compared to \n\nCYP2C9*1*1 subjects, individuals with the CYP2C9*2*2, *1*3, *2*3 and *3*3 genotypes have 20%, \n\n35-38%, 45-48% and 74% smaller CL/F values, respectively. Siponimod exposure is therefore \n\napproximately 25%, 61%, 91% and 284% higher in CYP2C9*2*2, *1*3, *2*3 and *3*3 subjects, \n\nrespectively, as compared to *1*1 subjects (see Table 4) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 4 CYP2C9 genotype effect on siponimod CL/F and systemic exposure \n \n\nCYP2C9 \n\ngenotype \n\nFrequency in \n\nCaucasians \n\nEstimated CL/F \n\n(L/h) \n\n% of \n\nCYP2C9*1*1 \n\nCL/F \n\n% exposure \n\nincrease versus \n\nCYP2C9*1*1 \n\nExtensive metabolisers \n\nCYP2C9*1*1 62-65 3.1-3.3 100 - \n\nCYP2C9*1*2 20-24 3.1-3.3 99-100 - \n\nIntermediate metabolisers \n\nCYP2C9*2*2 1-2 2.5-2.6 80 25 \n\nCYP2C9*1*3 9-12 1.9-2.1 62-65 61 \n\nPoor metabolisers \n\nCYP2C9*2*3 1.4-1.7 1.6-1.8 52-55 91 \n\nCYP2C9*3*3 0.3-0.4 0.9 26 284 \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nResults from population pharmacokinetics suggest that dose adjustment is not necessary in elderly \n\npatients (age 65 years and above). No patients over 61 years of age were enrolled in clinical studies. \n\nSiponimod should be used with caution in the elderly (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nGender \n\nResults from population pharmacokinetics suggest that gender-based dose adjustment is not necessary. \n\n \n\nRace/Ethnicity \n\nThe single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters were not different between Japanese and Caucasian \n\nhealthy subjects, indicating absence of ethnic sensitivity on the pharmacokinetics of siponimod. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo siponimod dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal \n\nimpairment. Mean siponimod half-life and Cmax (total and unbound) were comparable between \n\nsubjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. Total and unbound AUCs were only \n\nslightly increased (by 23 to 33%) compared to healthy subjects. The effects of end-stage renal disease \n\nor haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of siponimod have not been studied. Due to the high plasma \n\nprotein binding (>99.9%) of siponimod, haemodialysis is not expected to alter the total and unbound \n\nsiponimod concentration and no dose adjustments are anticipated based on these considerations. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nSiponimod must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). No dose \n\nadjustments for siponimod are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The \n\nunbound siponimod pharmacokinetics AUC is 15% and 50% higher in subjects with moderate and \n\nsevere hepatic impairment, respectively, in comparison with healthy subjects for the 0.25 mg single \n\ndose studied. The mean half-life of siponimod was unchanged in hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys, siponimod markedly affected the lymphoid \n\nsystem (lymphopenia, lymphoid atrophy and reduced antibody response), which is consistent with its \n\nprimary pharmacological activity at S1P1 receptors (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nDose-limiting toxicities in animal species were nephrotoxicity in mice, body weight development in \n\nrats and adverse CNS and gastrointestinal effects in monkeys. The main target organs of toxicity in \n\nrodents included the lung, liver, thyroid, kidney and uterus/vagina. In monkeys, effects on muscle and \n\nskin were additionally observed. These toxicities developed at more than 30-fold higher systemic \n\nsiponimod levels than the AUC-based human exposure at the maintenance dose of 2 mg/day. \n\n \n\nSiponimod did not exert any phototoxic or dependence potential and was not genotoxic in vitro and in \n\nvivo. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\n \n\nIn carcinogenicity investigations, siponimod induced lymphoma, haemangioma and \n\nhaemangiosarcoma in mice, whereas follicular adenoma and carcinoma of the thyroid gland were \n\nidentified in male rats. These tumour findings were either regarded as mouse-specific or attributable to \n\nmetabolic liver adaptations in the particularly sensitive rat species and are of questionable human \n\nrelevance. \n\n \n\nFertility and reproductive toxicity \n\n \n\nSiponimod did not affect male and female fertility in rats up to the highest dose tested, representing an \n\napproximate 19-fold safety margin based on human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 2 mg. \n\n \n\nThe receptor affected by siponimod (sphinosine-1-phosphate receptor) is known to be involved in \n\nvascular formation during embryogenesis. \n\n \n\nIn embryofoetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, siponimod induced embryotoxic \n\neffects in the absence of maternal toxicity. In both species, prenatal mortality was increased. While in \n\nrats a higher number of foetuses with external, skeletal and visceral malformations (e.g. cleft palate \n\nand misshapen clavicles, cardiomegaly and oedema) were noted, in rabbit foetuses skeletal and \n\nvisceral variations were predominantly observed. \n\n \n\nIn the prenatal and postnatal development study performed in rats, there was in increased number of \n\ndead (stillborn or found dead before postnatal day 4) and malformed pups (male pups with urogenital \n\nmalformations and/or decreased anogenital distance; pups of both sexes with oedema, swollen soft \n\ncranium, or flexed hindlimbs). \n\n \n\nThe exposure levels (AUC) at the respective NOAELs for embryofoetal (rats and rabbits) and \n\npre/postnatal (rats) development were below the human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of \n\n2 mg and consequently no safety margin exists. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n23 \n\n6.

Test requires a DNA sample obtained via blood or saliva (buccal \n\nswab). The test identifies two variant alleles for CYP2C9: CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853, \n\nc.430C>T) and CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, c.1075A>C). Both are single nucleotide \n\npolymorphisms. This genotyping can be done using a Sanger sequencing method or \n\nPCR-based assay methods. For further clarifications please refer to your local laboratory. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not prescribe siponimod in patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3*3. \n\n\uf0b7 Adjust the maintenance dose to 1 mg in patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotypes. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Bradyarrhythmia (including conduction defects) during treatment initiation: \n\n\uf0b7 Initiate treatment with a titration pack that lasts for 5 days. Start treatment with 0.25 mg \non day 1, up-titrated to the maintenance dose of 2 mg or 1 mg on day 6 based on the \n\nCYP2C9 metaboliser status. \n\n\uf0b7 If a titration dose is missed on one day during the first 6 days of treatment, treatment must \nbe re-initiated with a new titration pack. \n\n\uf0b7 If the maintenance dose is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, treatment \nmust be re-initiated with a new titration pack. \n\n\uf0b7 Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: \nPrior to initiating treatment: \n\no Perform vitals and baseline ECG prior to the first dose of siponimod in patients \nwith sinus bradycardia (heart rate [HR] <55 bpm), history of first- or \n\nsecond-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or \n\nheart failure (patients with NYHA class I and II). \n\nUntil 6 hours after first dose: \n\no Observe patients with sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), history of first- or \nsecond-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or \n\nheart failure (patients with NYHA class I and II) for a period of 6 hours after the \n\nfirst dose of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia and obtain an ECG \n\nat the end of the 6-hour monitoring period. \n\no If necessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by \nparenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. \n\nExtended observation (>6 hours after first dose): \n\no If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first \ndose, extend heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate \n\nincreases again. \n\no Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until \nresolution of findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during \n\nmonitoring at treatment initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first-dose monitoring \n\nafter the second dose of siponimod. \n\no Appropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the \nsymptoms/findings have resolved if the following events are observed: \n\na. New onset third-degree AV block occurring at any time \nb. Where at the 6-hour time point the ECG shows: New onset second-degree or \n\nhigher AV block, or QTc interval \u2265500 msec \n\nIf pharmacological treatment is required, monitoring should be continued overnight \n\nand 6-hour monitoring should be repeated after the second dose. \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n\uf0b7 Mayzent is contraindicated in: \n\n\uf0b7 Patients who, in the previous 6 months, had a myocardial infarction, unstable \nangina pectoris, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart \n\nfailure (requiring in-patient treatment), or New York Heart Association (NYHA) \n\nclass III/IV heart failure. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) \nblock, third-degree AV block, sino-atrial heart block or sick sinus syndrome, if \n\nthey do not wear a pacemaker. \n\n\uf0b7 Mayzent is not recommended in: \n\n\uf0b7 Patients with the below conditions. Siponimod treatment should be considered in \nthese patients only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks and a \n\ncardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring. At least \n\novernight extended monitoring is recommended. \n\no QTc prolongation >500 msec \no Severe untreated sleep apnoea \no History of symptomatic bradycardia \no History of recurrent syncope \no Uncontrolled hypertension \no Concomitant treatment with class Ia (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or \n\nclass III anti-arrhythmic medications, calcium channel blockers (such as \n\nverapamil, diltiazem) and other medications (e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) \n\nwhich are known to decrease the heart rate \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Infections, including varicella zoster reactivation, reactivation of the other viral infections, PML \nand other rare opportunistic infections: \n\n\uf0b7 There is an increased risk of infections including serious infections, in patients treated \nwith siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 Before initiating treatment, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or \nafter discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also \n\nrecommended periodically during treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 Before starting siponimod, test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) in patients \nwithout a physician-confirmed history of varicella or without documentation of a full \n\ncourse of vaccination against VZV. If tested negative, vaccination is recommended and \n\ntreatment with siponimod should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of \n\nvaccination to occur. \n\n\uf0b7 Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\uf0b7 Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with history of progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with severe active infection until infection \nis resolved. \n\n\uf0b7 Exercise caution when administering concomitant treatment with anti-neoplastic, \nimmune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) due to \n\nthe risk of additive immune system effects. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should be instructed to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to \ntheir prescriber during and for up to one month after treatment with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 Monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after \ntreatment with siponimod: \n\n\uf0b7 A case of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has been reported for siponimod. Prompt \ndiagnostic evaluation should be performed in patients with symptoms and signs \n\nconsistent with cryptococcal meningitis; appropriate treatment, if diagnosed, \n\nshould be initiated. Siponimod treatment should be suspended until CM has been \n\nexcluded. \n\n\uf0b7 Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nwith another sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Physicians should \n\nbe vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of PML. If PML is \n\nsuspected, treatment should be suspended until PML has been excluded. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Macular oedema: \n\n\uf0b7 Arrange an ophthalmological evaluation prior to initiating therapy and follow-up \nevaluations while receiving therapy in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, uveitis \n\nor underlying/co-existing retinal disease. \n\n\uf0b7 An ophthalmological evaluation 3-4 months after treatment initiation with siponimod is \nrecommended. \n\n\uf0b7 Instruct the patient to report visual disturbances at any time while on siponimod therapy. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with macular oedema until resolution. \n \n\n\uf0b7 Reproductive toxicity: \n\n\uf0b7 Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential \nnot using effective contraception. Advise women of potential serious risks to the foetus if \n\nsiponimod is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it. \n\n\uf0b7 A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to initiation of treatment in women of \nchildbearing potential. \n\n\uf0b7 Women of childbearing potential should be counselled before treatment initiation and \nregularly thereafter about the serious risks of siponimod to the foetus, facilitated by the \n\npregnancy-specific patient reminder card. \n\n\uf0b7 Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and \nfor at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 Siponimod should be stopped at least 10 days before a pregnancy is planned. When \nstopping siponimod for planning a pregnancy the possible return of disease activity \n\nshould be considered. \n\n\uf0b7 Counsel the patient in case of inadvertent pregnancy. \n\n\uf0b7 If a woman becomes pregnant while on treatment with siponimod, treatment must be \ndiscontinued. Pregnant women should be advised of potential serious risks to the foetus, \n\nand ultrasonography examinations should be performed. \n\n\uf0b7 Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 10 days following discontinuation \nof treatment with siponimod, please report it to Novartis by calling [insert local number] \n\nor visiting [insert URL], irrespective of adverse outcomes observed. \n\n\uf0b7 Novartis has put in place a PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring (PRIM) \nprogramme, which is a registry based on enhanced follow-up mechanisms to collect \n\ninformation about pregnancy in patients exposed to siponimod immediately before or \n\nduring pregnancy and on infant outcomes 12 months post-delivery. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n30 \n\n\uf0b7 Other reminders: \n\n\uf0b7 Perform liver function tests prior to initiating siponimod treatment. If patients develop \nsymptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction during treatment with siponimod, request a \n\nliver enzymes check. Discontinue treatment if significant liver injury is confirmed. \n\nSiponimod is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh \n\nclass C). \n\n\uf0b7 Be vigilant for skin malignancies while on treatment with siponimod. Patients treated \nwith siponimod should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. \n\nThese patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or \n\nPUVA-photochemotherapy. Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with active \n\nmalignancies. \n\n\uf0b7 Should a patient develop any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs or \naccelerated neurological deterioration, a complete physical and neurological examination \n\nshould promptly be scheduled and MRI should be considered. \n\n\uf0b7 Caution should be exercised in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities, or advanced \ndisease/disability (due to possible increased risks of, for example, infections, \n\nbradyarrhythmic events during treatment initiation). \n\n\uf0b7 If siponimod is discontinued, the possibility of recurrence of high disease activity should \nbe considered. \n\n\uf0b7 Provide patients with the Patient/Caregiver Guide and Pregnancy Reminder Card for \nwomen of childbearing potential. \n\n\uf0b7 Be familiar with the Mayzent Prescribing Information. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPatient/Caregiver Guide: \n \n\nThe Patient/Caregiver Guide shall contain the following key messages: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 What Mayzent is and how it works. \n\n\uf0b7 What multiple sclerosis is. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should read the package leaflet thoroughly before starting treatment and should keep \nthe package leaflet in case they need to refer to it again during treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 The importance of reporting adverse reactions. \n\n\uf0b7 Before starting treatment, a DNA sample via blood or saliva (buccal swab) is taken to determine \nthe CYP2C9 genotype to help determine appropriate dosing of siponimod. In certain cases the \n\npatient may not receive treatment with siponimod due to specific CYP2C9 genotype status. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients need to have chickenpox vaccination 1 month before starting siponimod treatment, if \nthe patient is not protected against the virus. \n\n\uf0b7 Siponimod is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or taking concomitant \nmedicines known to decrease heart rate. Patients should tell any doctor they see that they are \n\nbeing treated with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 For patients with certain heart problems, an ECG before initiating treatment with siponimod \nwill be needed. The need for observation (including an ECG monitoring) for 6 hours in a clinic \n\nafter the first dose of siponimod on day 1, if the patient has heart problems. Information that the \n\nmonitoring may need to extend overnight, if the patient experiences symptoms during the first \n\n6 hours. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, \nvertigo, nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of siponimod and during the titration period. \n\n\uf0b7 Before starting treatment patients should provide a recent complete blood count. \n\n\uf0b7 The signs and symptoms of infection during, and up to one month after treatment with \nsiponimod need to be reported immediately to the prescriber. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should report any symptoms of visual impairment immediately to the prescriber during \nand for up to one month after the end of treatment with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should call the doctor if a dose is missed during the first 6 days of treatment or for 4 or \nmore consecutive days after initiating treatment with siponimod. Treatment needs to be \n\nreinitiated with a new titration pack. \n\n\uf0b7 Liver function tests should be performed before starting treatment and repeated if there are \nsymptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should report any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (such as \nsudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes) or accelerated \n\nneurological deterioration to their doctors. \n\n\uf0b7 Due to the potential teratogenic risk of siponimod women of childbearing potential should: \n\n\uf0b7 Be informed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter by their physician about \nsiponimod serious risks to the foetus and about the contraindication in pregnant women \n\nand in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, facilitated by \n\nthe Pregnancy Reminder Card. \n\n\uf0b7 Have a negative pregnancy test before starting siponimod, which should be repeated at \nsuitable intervals. \n\n\uf0b7 Be using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after stopping \ntreatment to avoid pregnancy due to the potential risk of harm to the unborn baby. \n\n\uf0b7 Report immediately to the prescribing physician any (intended or unintended) pregnancy, \nduring treatment and up to 10 days following discontinuation of siponimod treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should be informed about the risk of skin malignancies while on treatment with \nsiponimod and should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. Also, these \n\npatients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or \n\nPUVA-photochemotherapy. \n\n\uf0b7 After stopping treatment with Mayzent, patients should inform their doctor immediately if their \ndisease symptoms are getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if they notice any new \n\nsymptoms. \n\n\uf0b7 Contact details of the siponimod prescriber. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nPregnancy Reminder Card for women of childbearing potential: \n \n\nThe pregnancy-specific patient reminder card shall contain the following key messages: \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not \nusing effective contraception. \n\n\uf0b7 Doctors will provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding \nthe potential teratogenic risk of siponimod and required actions to minimise this risk. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients will be informed by their doctor of the need for effective contraception while on \ntreatment and for 10 days after discontinuation. \n\n\uf0b7 A pregnancy test must be carried out and negative results verified by the doctor before starting \ntreatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients must use effective contraception during the treatment with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant or wants \nto become pregnant, siponimod should be discontinued. Effective contraception should be \n\nmaintained for at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 Doctors will provide counselling in the event of pregnancy and evaluation of the outcome of \nany pregnancy. \n\n\uf0b7 Patients should inform their doctor straight away if there is worsening of multiple sclerosis after \nstopping treatment with siponimod. \n\n\uf0b7 Women exposed to siponimod during pregnancy are encouraged to join the pregnancy exposure \nprogramme (PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring, PRIM) that monitors outcomes of \n\npregnancy. \n\n\uf0b7 Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 10 days following discontinuation of \ntreatment with siponimod, it should be immediately reported to the doctor or to Novartis by \n\ncalling [insert local number] or visiting [insert URL], irrespective of adverse outcomes \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX III \n\n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n  \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

What Mayzent is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Mayzent is \n\nMayzent contains the active substance siponimod. Siponimod belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nsphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. \n\n \n\nWhat Mayzent is used for \n\nMayzent is used to treat adults with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active \n\ndisease. Active disease in SPMS is when there are still relapses or when MRI (magnetic resonance \n\nimaging) results show signs of inflammation. \n\n \n\nHow Mayzent works \n\nMayzent helps to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from attacks by the body\u2019s own immune \n\nsystem. It does this by: \n\n- making some white blood cells (called lymphocytes) less able to move freely within the body, \nand \n\n- stopping these cells from reaching the brain and spinal cord. \nThis reduces nerve damage caused by SPMS and as a result Mayzent helps to slow down the effects of \n\nthe disease activity (such as worsening disability, brain lesions and relapses). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Mayzent \n\n \n\nDo not take Mayzent \n- if you are allergic to siponimod, peanut, soya or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have an immunodeficiency syndrome. \n- if you have ever had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. \n- if you have an active cancer. \n- if you have severe liver problems. \n- if, in the last 6 months, you have had a heart attack, unstable angina, stroke or certain types of \n\nheart failure. \n\n- if you have certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and you do not have a \npacemaker. \n\n- if blood tests show that your body cannot break down this medicine well enough, you should \nnot take it (see \u201cBlood tests before and during treatment\u201d below). \n\n- if you are pregnant or could become pregnant and are not using effective contraception. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Mayzent: \n\n\uf0b7 if you have an infection or if your immune system does not work properly (for example due to a \ndisease or to medicines that suppress the immune system; see also \u201cOther medicines and \n\nMayzent\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have never had chickenpox and have not been vaccinated against it. You may be at \ngreater risk of complications if you develop chickenpox during Mayzent treatment. Your doctor \n\nmay want to vaccinate you against chickenpox before you start treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 if you are planning to have any vaccinations. Your doctor will advise you on this (see \u201cOther \nmedicines and Mayzent\u201d). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had, or have, difficulties with your vision (in particular a condition called \nmacular oedema) or an infection or inflammation of the eye (uveitis). Your doctor may want \n\nyou to have eye examinations before you start treatment and regularly while you are on \n\ntreatment. Mayzent can cause a swelling in the macula (the area of the eye that enables you to \n\nsee shapes, colours and details) known as macular oedema. Your chance of developing macular \n\noedema is higher if you have had it before or if you have ever had uveitis (an inflammation of \n\nthe eye). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have diabetes. The chance of developing macular oedema (see above) is higher in patients \nwith diabetes. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had any of the following conditions (even if you are receiving treatment for \nthem): severe heart disease, irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), stroke or other disease \n\nrelated to the blood vessels in the brain, a slow heart rate, fainting, disturbance of heart rhythm \n\n(indicated by abnormal ECG results). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have severe breathing problems when sleeping (sleep apnoea). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. Your blood pressure \nwill need to be checked regularly. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have ever had liver problems. Your doctor may want to perform blood tests to check your \nliver function before prescribing Mayzent. \n\n\uf0b7 if you could become pregnant, because siponimod can harm the unborn baby when used during \npregnancy. Before you start treatment, your doctor will explain the risk and ask you to do a \n\npregnancy test to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective contraception during \n\ntreatment and up to 10 days after stopping treatment (see \u201cPregnancy, breast-feeding and \n\nfertility\u201d). \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before taking Mayzent. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n\nLook out for the following while taking Mayzent \n\nIf you get any of the following while taking Mayzent, tell your doctor immediately because it could \n\nbe serious: \n\n\uf0b7 if you have an infection. Mayzent lowers the number of white cells in your blood. White blood \ncells fight infection, so you may get infections more easily while you are taking Mayzent (and \n\nup to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking it). These could be serious and possibly even \n\nlife-threatening. \n\n\uf0b7 if you think your MS is getting worse or if you notice any new or unusual symptoms. A very \nrare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can cause \n\nsymptoms similar to SPMS. It can occur in patients taking medicines like Mayzent and other \n\nmedicines used for treating MS. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have fever, feel like you have flu or have a headache together with a stiff neck, sensitivity \nto light, nausea or confusion. These may be symptoms of a type of meningitis caused by a \n\nfungal infection (cryptococcal meningitis). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have changes in your vision, for example if the centre of your vision becomes blurred or \nhas shadows, a blind spot develops in the centre of your vision, or you have problems seeing \n\ncolours or fine detail. These may be symptoms of macular oedema. You may not notice any \n\nsymptoms in the early stages of macular oedema, and it can cause some of the same visual \n\nsymptoms as an MS attack (optic neuritis). Your doctor may want you to have an eye \n\nexamination 3 or 4 months after starting treatment and possibly again later. If macular oedema \n\nis confirmed, your doctor may advise you to stop Mayzent treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 if you have symptoms such as sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision \nchanges. These may be symptoms of a condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy \n\nsyndrome (PRES). \n\n\uf0b7 if you have symptoms such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, \nyellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes or abnormally dark urine. These may be symptoms \n\nof liver problems. \n\n \n\nSlow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat \n\nDuring the first days of treatment, Mayzent can cause the heart rate to slow down (bradycardia). You \n\nmay not feel anything or you may feel dizzy or tired. It may also cause your heartbeat to become \n\nirregular at the beginning of treatment. If anything indicates that you may be at higher risk of suffering \n\nfrom these effects, your doctor may decide to monitor you more closely at the start of treatment, refer \n\nyou first to a heart specialist (cardiologist), or choose not to give you Mayzent. \n\n \n\nTests before and during treatment \n\nHow quickly this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in the body varies from patient to patient and \n\ndifferent people therefore require different doses. Your doctor will perform a blood or saliva test \n\nbefore you start treatment to determine which dose is best for you. In rare cases, the test result may \n\nindicate that you should not take Mayzent. \n\n \n\nYour blood may also be tested before the start of treatment and periodically during treatment to check \n\nthe white blood cell count. Your doctor may need to stop or reduce your Mayzent dose if the white \n\nblood cell count is too low. \n\n \n\nBefore the start of treatment your blood will also be tested to check how well your liver is working. \n\n \n\nExposure to the sun and protection against the sun \n\nMayzent weakens your immune system. This may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. You \n\nshould limit your exposure to the sun and UV rays by: \n\n\uf0b7 wearing appropriate protective clothing. \n\n\uf0b7 regularly applying sunscreen with a high degree of UV protection. \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n47 \n\nWorsening of MS after stopping Mayzent treatment \n\nDo not stop taking Mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with \n\nMayzent (see \u201cIf you stop taking Mayzent\u201d in section 3). \n\n \n\nElderly patients (65 years of age and above) \n\nThere is no experience with Mayzent in elderly patients. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because it has not yet \n\nbeen studied in this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Mayzent \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking or receiving any of the following medicines \n\nor therapies: \n\n\uf0b7 medicines for an irregular heartbeat, such as amiodarone, procainamide, quinidine or sotalol. \nYour doctor may decide not to prescribe Mayzent because it could intensify the effect on \n\nirregular heartbeat. \n\n\uf0b7 medicines that slow down the heartbeat, such as diltiazem or verapamil (which belong to a \ngroup of medicines called calcium channel blockers), digoxin or ivabradine. Your doctor may \n\nrefer you to a heart specialist, as your medicines may need to be changed because Mayzent may \n\nalso slow down your heartbeat in the first days of treatment. If you are taking a beta blocker, \n\nsuch as atenolol or propranolol, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop your beta-blocker \n\ntreatment until you have reached your full daily dose of Mayzent. \n\n\uf0b7 medicines that affect the immune system, such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants or other \nmedicines to treat MS. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking these to avoid an increased \n\neffect on the immune system. \n\n\uf0b7 vaccines. If you need to have a vaccination, talk to your doctor first. During and for up to \n4 weeks after stopping treatment with Mayzent, you should not be given certain types of \n\nvaccine (called live attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were \n\nsupposed to prevent (see section 2). \n\n\uf0b7 fluconazole and certain other medicines can increase the levels of Mayzent in the blood and are \n\nnot recommended to be taken in combination with Mayzent. Your doctor will advise you on \n\nthis. \n\n\uf0b7 carbamazepine and certain other medicines can lower the levels of Mayzent in your blood and \ncan therefore stop it from working properly. Your doctor will advise you on this. \n\n\uf0b7 modafinil and certain other medicines can lower the levels of Mayzent in the blood of certain \npatients and can therefore stop it from working properly. Your doctor will advise you on this if \n\nthis is relevant for you. \n\n\uf0b7 phototherapy with UV radiation or PUVA photochemotherapy. UV therapy during Mayzent \ntreatment may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDo not use Mayzent during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman \n\nwho could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. If Mayzent is used during \n\npregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. If you are a woman who could become \n\npregnant, your doctor will inform you about this risk before you start treatment with Mayzent and will \n\nask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant. You must use effective \n\ncontraception while taking Mayzent and for at least 10 days after you stop taking it to avoid becoming \n\npregnant. Ask your doctor about reliable methods of contraception. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nIf you do become pregnant while taking Mayzent, tell your doctor straight away. Your doctor will \n\ndecide to stop treatment (see \u201cIf you stop taking Mayzent\u201d in section 3). Specialised pre-natal \n\nmonitoring will be performed. \n\n \n\nYou should not breast-feed while you are taking Mayzent. Mayzent may pass into breast milk and \n\nthere is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nYour doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \n\nMayzent is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines when you are on your regular \n\ntreatment dose. At the start of treatment you may occasionally feel dizzy. On your first day of \n\ntreatment with Mayzent, therefore, you should not drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nMayzent contains lactose and soya lecithin \n\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \n\nbefore taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Mayzent \n\n \n\nTreatment with Mayzent will be overseen by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of MS. \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nHow much Mayzent to take \n\nStarting treatment \n\nYou will be given a titration pack, with which your dose will be gradually increased over 5 days. \n\nFollow the instructions on the pack (see also the \u201cTitration pack\u201d table). \n\n \n\nThe purpose of the titration phase is to reduce the risk of side effects on your heart at the start of \n\ntreatment. Your doctor may monitor you closely at the start of treatment if you are at risk of your \n\nheartbeat becoming slower or irregular. \n\n \n\nTitration pack \n\n \n\nDay Dose Number of Mayzent 0.25 mg \n\ntablets to take \n\nDay 1 0.25 mg 1 tablet \n\nDay 2 0.25 mg 1 tablet \n\nDay 3 0.5 mg 2 tablets \n\nDay 4 0.75 mg 3 tablets \n\nDay 5 1.25 mg 5 tablets \n\n \n\nOn day 6, you will switch to your regular treatment dose. \n\n \n\nOn the first 6 days of treatment, it is recommended that you take the tablets in the morning with or \n\nwithout food. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n49 \n\nTreatment dose \nThe recommended dose is 2 mg once daily (one tablet of 2 mg Mayzent) with or without food. \n\n \n\nYour doctor may instruct you to take only 1 mg once daily (four 0.25 mg tablets) if the blood test \n\nperformed before the start of treatment showed that your body breaks down Mayzent slowly (see \n\n\u201cTests before and during treatment\u201d). If this applies to you, note that it is nevertheless safe for you to \n\ntake five 0.25 mg tablets on day 5 of the titration period as indicated above. \n\n \n\nMayzent is for oral use. Take the tablet with water. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Mayzent than you should \nIf you have taken too many Mayzent tablets, or if you take your first tablet from the treatment dose \n\npack instead of the titration pack by mistake, call your doctor straight away. Your doctor may decide \n\nto keep you under observation. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Mayzent \nDuring the first 6 days of treatment, if you have forgotten to take your dose on one day, call your \n\ndoctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor will need to prescribe a new titration pack. You will \n\nhave to restart at day 1. \n\n \n\nIf you miss a dose when you are on the regular treatment dose (day 7 onwards), take it as soon as you \n\nremember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. Do not \n\ntake a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget to take Mayzent for 4 or more days in \n\na row, call your doctor before you take the next dose. Your doctor will need to prescribe a new \n\ntitration pack and you will have to restart treatment at day 1. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Mayzent \n\nDo not stop taking Mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. \n\n \n\nMayzent will stay in your body for up to 10 days after you stop taking it. Your white blood cell \n\n(lymphocyte) count may remain low for up to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking Mayzent. The side \n\neffects described in this leaflet may still occur during this period (see \u201cPossible side effects\u201d in \n\nsection 4). \n\n \n\nIf you have to restart Mayzent more than 4 days after you stopped taking it, your doctor will prescribe \n\na new titration pack and you will have to restart treatment at day 1 again. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor straight away if you think your MS worsens after you have stopped treatment with \n\nMayzent. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n4.

disease. active disease in spms is when there are still relapses or when mri (magnetic resonance imaging) results show signs of inflammation. how mayzent works mayzent helps to protect the central

cells from reaching the brain and spinal cord. this reduces nerve damage caused by spms and as a result mayzent helps to slow down the effects of the disease activity (such as worsening disability,

leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. - if you have an active cancer. - if you have severe liver problems. - if, in the last 6 months, you have had a heart attack, unstable angina, stroke or certain types of heart failure. - if you have certain types of irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and you do not have a pacemaker. - if blood tests show that your body cannot break down this medicine well enough, you should not take it (see \"blood tests before and during treatment\" below). - if you are pregnant or could become pregnant and are not using effective contraception. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor before taking mayzent: if you have an infection or if your immune system does not work properly (for example due to a disease or to medicines that suppress the immune system; see also \"other medicines and mayzent\"). if you have never had chickenpox and have not been vaccinated against it. you may be at greater risk of complications if you develop chickenpox during mayzent treatment. your doctor may want to vaccinate you against chickenpox before you start treatment. if you are planning to have any vaccinations. your doctor will advise you on this (see \"other medicines and mayzent\"). if you have ever had, or have, difficulties with your vision (in particular a condition called macular oedema) or an infection or inflammation of the eye (uveitis). your doctor may want you to have eye examinations before you start treatment and regularly while you are on treatment. mayzent can cause a swelling in the macula (the area of the eye that enables you to see shapes, colours and details) known as macular oedema. your chance of developing macular oedema is higher if you have had it before or if you have ever had uveitis (an inflammation of the eye). if you have diabetes. the chance of developing macular oedema (see above) is higher in patients with diabetes. if you have ever had any of the following conditions (even if you are receiving treatment for them): severe heart disease, irregular or abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), stroke or other disease related to the blood vessels in the brain, a slow heart rate, fainting, disturbance of heart rhythm (indicated by abnormal ecg results). if you have severe breathing problems when sleeping (sleep apnoea). if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicines. your blood pressure will need to be checked regularly. if you have ever had liver problems. your doctor may want to perform blood tests to check your liver function before prescribing mayzent. if you could become pregnant, because siponimod can harm the unborn baby when used during pregnancy. before you start treatment, your doctor will explain the risk and ask you to do a pregnancy test to ensure that you are not pregnant. you must use effective contraception during treatment and up to 10 days after stopping treatment (see \"pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\"). if any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before taking mayzent. look out for the following while taking mayzent if you get any of the following while taking mayzent, tell your doctor immediately because it could be serious: if you have an infection. mayzent lowers the number of white cells in your blood. white blood cells fight infection, so you may get infections more easily while you are taking mayzent (and up to 3 to 4 weeks after you stop taking it). these could be serious and possibly even life-threatening. if you think your ms is getting worse or if you notice any new or unusual symptoms. a very rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) can cause symptoms similar to spms. it can occur in patients taking medicines like mayzent and other medicines used for treating ms. if you have fever, feel like you have flu or have a headache together with a stiff neck, sensitivity to light, nausea or confusion. these may be symptoms of a type of meningitis caused by a fungal infection (cryptococcal meningitis). if you have changes in your vision, for example if the centre of your vision becomes blurred or has shadows, a blind spot develops in the centre of your vision, or you have problems seeing colours or fine detail. these may be symptoms of macular oedema. you may not notice any symptoms in the early stages of macular oedema, and it can cause some of the same visual symptoms as an ms attack (optic neuritis). your doctor may want you to have an eye examination 3 or 4 months after starting treatment and possibly again later. if macular oedema is confirmed, your doctor may advise you to stop mayzent treatment. if you have symptoms such as sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes. these may be symptoms of a condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres). if you have symptoms such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes or abnormally dark urine. these may be symptoms of liver problems. slow heart rate (bradycardia) and irregular heartbeat during the first days of treatment, mayzent can cause the heart rate to slow down (bradycardia). you may not feel anything or you may feel dizzy or tired. it may also cause your heartbeat to become irregular at the beginning of treatment. if anything indicates that you may be at higher risk of suffering from these effects, your doctor may decide to monitor you more closely at the start of treatment, refer you first to a heart specialist (cardiologist), or choose not to give you mayzent. tests before and during treatment how quickly this medicine is broken down (metabolised) in the body varies from patient to patient and different people therefore require different doses. your doctor will perform a blood or saliva test before you start treatment to determine which dose is best for you. in rare cases, the test result may indicate that you should not take mayzent. your blood may also be tested before the start of treatment and periodically during treatment to check the white blood cell count. your doctor may need to stop or reduce your mayzent dose if the white blood cell count is too low. before the start of treatment your blood will also be tested to check how well your liver is working. exposure to the sun and protection against the sun mayzent weakens your immune system. this may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. you should limit your exposure to the sun and uv rays by: wearing appropriate protective clothing. regularly applying sunscreen with a high degree of uv protection. worsening of ms after stopping mayzent treatment do not stop taking mayzent or change your dose without talking to your doctor first. tell your doctor straight away if you think your ms worsens after you have stopped treatment with mayzent (see \"if you stop taking mayzent\" in section 3). elderly patients (65 years of age and above) there is no experience with mayzent in elderly patients. talk to your doctor if you have any concerns. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years of age because it has not yet been studied in this age group. other medicines and mayzent tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking or receiving any of the following medicines or therapies: medicines for an irregular heartbeat, such as amiodarone, procainamide, quinidine or sotalol. your doctor may decide not to prescribe mayzent because it could intensify the effect on irregular heartbeat. medicines that slow down the heartbeat, such as diltiazem or verapamil (which belong to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers), digoxin or ivabradine. your doctor may refer you to a heart specialist, as your medicines may need to be changed because mayzent may also slow down your heartbeat in the first days of treatment. if you are taking a beta blocker, such as atenolol or propranolol, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop your beta-blocker treatment until you have reached your full daily dose of mayzent. medicines that affect the immune system, such as chemotherapy, immunosuppressants or other medicines to treat ms. your doctor may ask you to stop taking these to avoid an increased effect on the immune system. vaccines. if you need to have a vaccination, talk to your doctor first. during and for up to 4 weeks after stopping treatment with mayzent, you should not be given certain types of vaccine (called live attenuated vaccines) as they could trigger the infection that they were supposed to prevent (see section 2). fluconazole and certain other medicines can increase the levels of mayzent in the blood and are not recommended to be taken in combination with mayzent. your doctor will advise you on this. carbamazepine and certain other medicines can lower the levels of mayzent in your blood and can therefore stop it from working properly. your doctor will advise you on this. modafinil and certain other medicines can lower the levels of mayzent in the blood of certain patients and can therefore stop it from working properly. your doctor will advise you on this if this is relevant for you. phototherapy with uv radiation or puva photochemotherapy. uv therapy during mayzent treatment may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. do not use mayzent during pregnancy, if you are trying to become pregnant or if you are a woman who could become pregnant and you are not using effective contraception. if mayzent is used during pregnancy, there is a risk of harm to the unborn baby. if you are a woman who could become pregnant, your doctor will inform you about this risk before you start treatment with mayzent and will ask you to do a pregnancy test in order to ensure that you are not pregnant. you must use effective contraception while taking mayzent and for at least 10 days after you stop taking it to avoid becoming pregnant. ask your doctor about reliable methods of contraception. if you do become pregnant while taking mayzent, tell your doctor straight away. your doctor will decide to stop treatment (see \"if you stop taking mayzent\" in section 3). specialised pre-natal monitoring will be performed. you should not breast-feed while you are taking mayzent. mayzent may pass into breast milk and there is a risk of serious side effects for the baby. driving and using machines your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. mayzent is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines when you are on your regular treatment dose. at the start of treatment you may occasionally feel dizzy. on your first day of treatment with mayzent, therefore, you should not drive or use machines. mayzent contains lactose and soya lecithin if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. if you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "mayzent", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "mayzent", "Type": "TREATMENT", "BeginOffset": 12,

only 1 mg once daily (four 0.25 mg tablets) if the blood test performed before the start of treatment showed that your body breaks down mayzent slowly (see \"tests before and during treatment\"). if

you take more mayzent than you should if you have taken too many mayzent tablets, or if you take your first tablet from the treatment dose pack instead of the titration pack by mistake, call your doctor straight away. your doctor may decide to keep you under observation. if you forget to take mayzent during the first 6 days of treatment, if you have forgotten to take your dose on one day, call your doctor before you take the next dose. your doctor will need to prescribe a new titration pack. you will have to restart at day 1. if you miss a dose when you are on the regular treatment dose (day 7 onwards), take it as soon as you remember. if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue as usual. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you forget to take mayzent for 4 or more days in a row, call your doctor before you take the next dose. your doctor will need to prescribe a new titration pack and you will have to restart treatment at
