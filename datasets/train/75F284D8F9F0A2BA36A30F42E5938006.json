NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCystadrops 3.8 mg/mL eye drops solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL contains mercaptamine hydrochloride equivalent to 3.8 mg mercaptamine (cysteamine). \n \nExcipient with known effect:  \nEach mL of eye drops solution contains 0.1 mg of benzalkonium chloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n  \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops solution. \n \nViscous, clear solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCystadrops is indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits in adults and children from \n2 years of age with cystinosis. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Cystadrops should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the \nmanagement of cystinosis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is one drop in each eye, 4 times a day during waking hours. The \nrecommended interval between each instillation is 4 hours. The dose could be decreased progressively \n(to a minimum total daily dose of 1 drop in each eye) depending on the results of ophthalmic \nexamination (such as, corneal cystine crystal deposits, photophobia). \nIf the patient misses an instillation, the patient should be told to continue the treatment with the next \ninstillation. \nThe dose should not exceed 4 drops a day in each eye.  \nThe accumulation of corneal cystine crystals increases if Cystadrops is discontinued. The treatment \nshould not be stopped. \n \nPaediatric population \nCystadrops may be used in paediatric patients from 2 years of age at the same dose as in adults (see \nsection 5.1).  \nThe safety and efficacy of Cystadrops in children aged less than 2 years has not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor ocular use. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nBefore the first admnistration, in order to facilitate the administration, the patient should be told to \nbring back Cystadrops at room temperature. After first opening, the patient should be told to keep the \ndropper bottle at room temperature. \n \nTo avoid sticky eyes in the morning, the patient should be advised to apply the last drop of the day at \nleast 30 minutes before going to bed. \n \nTo prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care must be taken not to touch the eyelids, \nsurrounding areas, or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the dropper bottle. \n \nThe patient should be told to discard the dropper bottle after 7 days of use. \n \nIn case of concomitant therapy with other topical ocular medicinal products, an interval of ten minutes \nshould be allowed between successive applications. Eye ointments should be administered last. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCystadrops contains benzalkonium chloride which may cause eye irritation. \n \nBenzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophtalmic products, has also \nbeen reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Monitoring is \nrequired. \n \nContact lenses \nBenzalkonium chloride is known to discolour soft contact lenses. Contact with soft contact lenses \nshould be avoided. Patients should be instructed to remove contact lenses prior to the administration of \nthe eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before re-inserting contact lenses. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nSince the recommended total daily dose of cysteamine base is no more than approximately 0.4% of the \nhighest recommended oral dose of cysteamine base in any age group, no interactions with orally \nadministered medicinal products are anticipated. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThe recommended total daily ocular dose of cysteamine is no more than approximately 0.4% of the \nhighest recommended dose of oral cysteamine in any age group. Systemic exposure of cysteamine \nfollowing ocular administration is therefore lower than following oral administration. Although no \neffects during pregnancy and breast-feeding are anticipated, since systemic exposure to cysteamine is \nnegligible, precautions should be taken with concomitant treatment with oral cysteamine. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of cysteamine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown.  \nTherefore, oral cysteamine should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, \nunless clearly necessary. \nIf a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient \nmust be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nBreast-feeding \nCysteamine excretion in human's milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in \nbreast-feeding mothers and neonates (see section 5.3), women taking oral cysteamine should not \nbreast-feed. \n \nFertility \nNo data on the effect of cysteamine on human fertility are available. Studies in animals have shown a \nreduction on fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCystadrops may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nTemporary (in average less than 1 minute) blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the \nability to drive or use machines. \nIf blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient must wait until the vision clears before driving or \nusing machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reactions are eye pain, ocular hyperaemia, eye pruritus, lacrimation \nincreased, blurred vision or eye irritation. The majority of these adverse reactions are transient and \nmost are mild or moderate. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions were reported during clinical trials and the French NPU programme \nwith Cystadrops. Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency \n(by patient).  \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10),  uncommon \n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000  to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).  \n \n\n \nPaediatric population \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are the same as in adults. \n69 paediatric patients were followed through clinical trials and the French NPU programme. 19 \npatients were under 6 years old, 21 between 6 and 12 years old and 29 between 12 and 18 years old. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions \n\nEye disorders Very common : eye pain, vision blurred, eye irritation, ocular hyperaemia, eye pruritus, lacrimation increased, deposit eye \n\n \n\nCommon : abnormal sensation in eye, dry eye, foreign body \nsensation in eye, eyelid oedema, eyelid irritation, visual \nimpairment, hordeolum \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common : instillation site discomfort (mainly sticky eyes \nand sticky eyelashes) \n\n Common : instillation site pain  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n5 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose is unlikely to occur with ocular administration.  \n \nIn case of accidental ingestion, monitoring and symptomatic management of the patient should be \nimplemented.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophtalmologicals, other ophtalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA21.   \n \nMechanism of action \nCysteamine reduces corneal cystine crystal accumulation acting as a cystine-depleting agent by \nconverting cystine to cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nTwo clinical trials were performed with Cystadrops: a single arm clinical trial on 8 children and adults \n(OCT-1 study) and a randomised, multi-centre, open label, active controlled phase III clinical trial \n(CHOC study) conducted on 32 patients. \n \nOCT-1 study \nThis study assessed the safety and efficacy of Cystadrops during 5 years. Dose adaptation was \nperformed following ocular examination. None of the patients discontinued treatment over the 5 year \nfollow-up.  \nThe efficacy was assessed with In-Vivo Confocal Microscopy total score (IVCM score) by \nquantifying the cystine crystals in the 7 layers of the cornea. After 30 days of treatment and at a \nmedian frequency of 4 instillations per day, an average 30% decrease in the IVCM total score was \nobserved. A mean decrease in corneal cystine crystal deposits of 30%, in comparison with baseline, \nwas maintained over time with a median dosing regimen of 3 drops/eye/day (range 1-3 drops) for 7 of \nthe 8 patients. Photophobia tended to improve over time. \n \nCHOC study \nThis study was a randomised, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and the safety profile of \nCystadrops following a period of 90 days of treatment at a dose regimen of 4 drops/eye/day. The \nIVCM total score was the primary efficacy endpoint. 15 patients were exposed to Cystadrops. The \nmean IVCM total score was calculated for 11 patients. A trend towards a lower IVCM total score in \nCystadrops arm was observed at day 30. The mean decrease by 40% in the Cystadrops arm was \nconfirmed at day 90. Superiority of Cystadrops was demonstrated compared to the control arm \n(cysteamine hydrochloride 0.10%) p<0.001 95% CI (2.11; 5.58). Superiority of Cystadrops was also \ndemonstrated for photophobia rated by the investigator compared to the control arm (cysteamine \nhydrochloride 0.10%) p< 0.048 95% CI (0.23; 1.14). \n \nPaediatric population \nClinical data on safety and efficacy were collected during the 2 clinical trials (OCT-1 and CHOC \nstudies). In total 15 paediatric patients were exposed to Cystadrops whereof 3 subjects (including one \n2 year and one 3 year old subject) being less than 6 years of age. The efficacy and safety results are \nsimilar in both paediatric and adult populations. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCystadrops in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of corneal cystine \ncrystal deposits in cystinosis patients (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nHuman pharmacokinetic assessment following ocular administration of Cystadrops was not \nperformed.  \n \nSimilarly to other topically administered ocular products, systemic absorption is likely to occur.  \nHowever it should be considered that the recommended daily dose of cysteamine applied as eye drops \nis no more than approximately 0.4% of the highest recommended daily oral dose of cysteamine in any \nage group.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic exposure following ocular administration is anticipated to be low. When there is concomitant \nuse of ocular and oral treatment with cysteamine the contribution to any systemic risk from ocular \nadministration is considered negligible. \n \nPreclinical data on oral cysteamine: \nGenotoxicity studies have been performed: induction of chromosome aberrations in cultured \neukaryotic cell lines has been reported and specific studies with cysteamine did not show any \nmutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in the mouse micronucleus test. \n \nReproduction studies showed embryofoetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in \nrats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic \neffects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis \nat a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  \nThis is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is less than half the recommended clinical \nmaintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.30 g/m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at \n375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival \nof the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of \nlactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals.  \n \nAdministration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. \n \nHigh doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice \nbut not in monkeys.  Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in \nseveral animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown.  \n \nNo carcinogenic studies have been conducted with cysteamine. \n \n \n6.

What Cystadrops is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Cystadrops is \nCystadrops is an eye drops solution that contains the active substance cysteamine (also known as \nmercaptamine). \n \nWhat it is used for \nIt is used to reduce the quantity of cystine crystals in the surface of the eye (cornea) in adults and \nchildren from 2 years of age with cystinosis. \n \nWhat is cystinosis \nCystinosis is a rare hereditary disease in which the body is unable to remove excess cystine (an amino \nacid), causing cystine crystals to accumulate in various organs (such as kidney and eyes). \nAccumulation of crystals in the eye can lead to increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), corneal \ndeterioration (keratopathy) and loss of vision . \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Cystadrops \n \nDo not use Cystadrops \nIf you are allergic to cysteamine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Cystadrops. \n \nOther medicines and Cystadrops \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nEven if the level of Cystadrops in the blood is negligible, precautions should be taken. \n\n\n\n18 \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may find that your vision is blurred for a few minutes just after using Cystadrops. Do not drive or \nuse machines until your vision is clear. \n \nCystadrops contains benzalkonium chloride \nThis medicine contains 5 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each drop which is equivalent to 0.1 \nmg/ml. \nBenzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the contact \nlenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 15 minutes \nafterwards. \nBenzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of the \ncornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye). If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the \neye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. \n \n \n \n3. How to use Cystadrops \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nRecommended dose \n\u2022 The recommended dose  is 1 drop in each eye, 4 times a day during waking hours.  \n\u2022 The recommended interval between each application is 4 hours (for example, you can have your \n\neye drops at 8.00 am, 12.00 am, 4.00 pm and 8.00 pm).  \n\u2022 To avoid sticky eyes in the morning, it is recommended to apply the last drop of the day at least 30 \n\nminutes before going to bed.  \n\u2022 The dose may be gradually decreased (to a minimum total daily dose of 1 drop in each eye) by \n\nyour doctor based on eye examinations. \n \n\nOnly use the drops in your eyes (ocular use). \n \nTo use the eye drops, please follow the instructions below carefully. Those instructions are also \navailable as an animated movie on www.cystadrops.net \u2018QR code to be included\u2019 \n \nStep 1: Before using a vial for the first time \n\n\u2022 Cystadrops must be brought back at room temperature before the first administration. It will \nfacilitate the use of the drops. \n\n\u2022 Immediately before using a vial for the first time, write the date of opening in the space \nprovided on the carton box. \n\n\u2022 Wash your hands carefully in order to avoid contamination by bacteria of the content in the \nvial. \n\n\u2022 Remove the green protective cap (picture 1). \n\u2022 Remove the metal seal (picture 2). \n\u2022 Remove the grey stopper (picture 3) from the vial. \n\u2022 Do not touch the opening of the vial after removing the grey stopper. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nremove \nremove \n\nremove \n\nhttp://www.cystadrops.net/\n\n\n19 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\u2022 Take the dropper out of its sachet, without touching the end intended to be attached to the vial, \nand attach it (picture 4) to the vial.

Cystadrops can be used for up \n\nto 7 days from the time of opening.  \n\u2022 Get the dropper bottle and a mirror. \n\u2022 Wash your hands. \n\n \nStep 3: Using the eye drops \n\n\u2022 Hold the dropper bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. Move firmly the \ndropper bottle up and down to facilitate the filing of the dropper. \n\n\u2022 Unscrew the small white cap from the dropper. \n\u2022 Tilt your head back. Pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a \u201cpocket\u201d \n\nbetween the eyelid and your eye. The drop will go in here (picture 6). \n \n\n\uf086  \n \n\n\u2022 Bring the dropper bottle tip close to the eye.

It \ncould infect the drops. \n\n\u2022 Gently squeeze the dropper to release one drop of Cystadrops at a time. Take special care not \nto touch the tip of the dropper with your fingers. \n\n\u2022 After using Cystadrops, press a finger into the corner of your eye by the nose (picture 7), then \ngently massage your upper eyelid to spread the eye drops over the eye. \n\n \n\n \n                                                                 \uf087 \n \n \n\n\u2022 To avoid potential irritation, remove excess medicine around the eye with a moist tissue \n(picture 8). \n\n\u2022 Repeat the step 3 for the other eye. \n\u2022 Replace the small white cap on the dropper immediately after use. \n\n \n\n \n                                                             \uf088 \n \nStep 4: Storing the eye drops after use \n\n\u2022 Place the dropper bottle into the carton box. \n\u2022 Keep Cystadrops at room temperature (it will facilitate the use of the dropper). \n\u2022 Discard 7 days after opening. \n\n \nIf a drop misses your eye \nTry again.  \n \nIf you use Cystadrops with another eye medicine \nEnsure that there is at least a 10 minute gap between using Cystadrops and the other eye medicine. \nAdminister eye ointments last. \n \nIf you wear soft contact lenses \nDo not use the drops with your lenses in. After using the drops wait 15 minutes before putting your \nlenses back in. \n \nIf you use more Cystadrops than you should \nIf you put too many drops in your eyes, rinse your eyes out, preferably with saline solution (or if not \navailable with warm water). Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose. \n \nIf you forget to use Cystadrops \nWait for your next scheduled application and then continue with your regular routine. Do not use a \ndouble dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Cystadrops \nCystadrops must be used every day for the medicine to work properly. If you stop using Cystadrops, \ncystine crystals accumulation in the eye (cornea) may increase and lead to increased sensitity to light \n\n\n\n21 \n\n(photophobia), corneal deterioration (keratopathy) and loss of vision. Therefore talk to your doctor \nbefore stopping this treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n \n4.

{"Title": "3. how to use cystadrops", "Section_Content": "always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. recommended dose the recommended dose is 1 drop in each eye, 4 times a day during waking hours. the recommended interval between each application is 4 hours (for example, you can have your eye drops at 8.00 am, 12.00 am, 4.00 pm and 8.00 pm). to avoid sticky eyes in the morning, it is recommended to apply the last drop of the day at least 30 minutes before going to bed. the dose may be gradually decreased (to a minimum total daily dose of 1 drop in each eye) by your doctor based on eye examinations. only use the drops in your eyes (ocular use). to use the eye drops, please follow the instructions below carefully. those instructions are also available as an animated movie on 'qr code to be included' step 1: before using a vial for the first time cystadrops must be brought back at room temperature before the first administration. it will facilitate the use of the drops. immediately before using a vial for the first time, write the date of opening in the space provided on the carton box. wash your hands carefully in order to avoid contamination by bacteria of the content in the vial. remove the green protective cap (picture 1). remove the metal seal (picture 2). remove the grey stopper (picture 3) from the vial. do not touch the opening of the vial after removing the grey stopper. remove remove remove 19 take the dropper out of its sachet, without touching the end intended to be attached to the vial, and attach it (picture 4) to the vial. do not remove the dropper from the vial. make sure that you do not lose the small white cap (picture 5) that comes on the top of the dropper. step 2: before using the eye drops check the opening date that you wrote down on the carton box. cystadrops can be used for up to 7 days from the time of opening. get the dropper bottle and a mirror. wash your hands. step 3: using the eye drops hold the dropper bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. move firmly the dropper bottle up and down to facilitate the filing of the dropper. unscrew the small white cap from the dropper. tilt your head back. pull down your eyelid with a clean finger, until there is a \"pocket\" between the eyelid and your eye. the drop will go in here (picture 6). \uf086 bring the dropper bottle tip close to the eye. use the mirror if it helps. metal seal vial green protective cap grey stopper vial vial dropper dropper small white cap turn and push to attach small white cap 20 do not touch your eye or eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. it could infect the drops. gently squeeze the dropper to release one drop of cystadrops at a time. take special care not to touch the tip of the dropper with your fingers. after using cystadrops, press a finger into the corner of your eye by the nose (picture 7), then gently massage your upper eyelid to spread the eye drops over the eye. \uf087 to avoid potential irritation, remove excess medicine around the eye with a moist tissue (picture 8). repeat the step 3 for the other eye. replace the small white cap on the dropper immediately after use. \uf088 step 4: storing the eye drops after use place the dropper bottle into the carton box. keep cystadrops at room temperature (it will facilitate the use of the dropper). discard 7 days after opening. if a drop misses your eye try again. if you use cystadrops with another eye medicine ensure that there is at least a 10 minute gap between using cystadrops and the other eye medicine. administer eye ointments last. if you wear soft contact lenses do not use the drops with your lenses in. after using the drops wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in. if you use more cystadrops than you should if you put too many drops in your eyes, rinse your eyes out, preferably with saline solution (or if not available with warm water). do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular dose. if you forget to use cystadrops wait for your next scheduled application and then continue with your regular routine. do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop using cystadrops cystadrops must be used every day for the medicine to work properly. if you stop using cystadrops, cystine crystals accumulation in the eye (cornea) may increase and lead to increased sensitity to light 21 (photophobia), corneal deterioration (keratopathy) and loss of vision. therefore talk to your doctor before stopping this treatment. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":
