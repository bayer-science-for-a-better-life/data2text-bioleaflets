NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXiapex 0.9 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial of powder contains 0.9 mg of collagenase clostridium histolyticum*. \n \n*A formulation of two collagenase enzymes co-expressed and harvested from anaerobic fermentation \nof a phenotypically selected strain of Clostridium histolyticum bacterium. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nSodium injected per joint in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture: \nMetacarpophalangeal (MP) joints: 0.9 mg. \nProximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints: 0.7 mg. \n \nSodium injected per plaque in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease: 0.9 mg. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nThe powder is a white lyophilised powder. \n \nThe solvent is a clear colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXiapex is indicated for: \n• The treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture in adult patients with a palpable cord. \n• The treatment of adult men with Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature \n\ndeformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \n \nXiapex must be administered by a physician appropriately trained in the correct administration of the \nmedicinal product and experienced in the diagnosis and management of Dupuytren’s disease. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Xiapex is 0.58 mg per injection into a palpable Dupuytren’s cord. The \nvolume of solvent required and the volume of reconstituted Xiapex to be administered into the \nDupuytren’s cord differs depending on the type of joint being treated (for the reconstitution \ninstructions, see section 6.6, Table 14). \n• For cords affecting MP joints each dose is administered in an injection volume of 0.25 ml. \n• For cords affecting PIP joints, each dose is administered in an injection volume of 0.20 ml. \n \nInjections in up to two cords or two affected joints in the same hand can be administered according to \nthe injection procedure during a treatment visit. Two palpable cords affecting two joints may be \ninjected or one palpable cord affecting two joints in the same finger may be injected at two locations \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\nduring a treatment visit. Each injection contains a 0.58 mg dose. If the disease has resulted in multiple \ncontractures, additional cords may be treated at other treatment visits approximately 4 weeks apart. \n \nApproximately 24-72 hours after injection, a finger extension procedure may be performed, as \nnecessary, to facilitate cord disruption. If a satisfactory response has not been achieved, the injection \nand finger extension procedures may be repeated after approximately 4 weeks. Injections and finger \nextension procedures may be administered up to 3 times per cord at approximately 4-week intervals. \nClinical study experience with Xiapex is currently limited to up to 3 injections per cord and up to 8 \ninjections in total. \n \nPeyronie’s disease \n \nXiapex must be administered by a physician appropriately trained in the correct administration of the \nmedicinal product and experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of male urological diseases. Patients \nwith penile curvature >90° were not included in the clinical studies. Treatment in this group can \ntherefore not be recommended. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Xiapex is 0.58 mg per injection administered into a Peyronie’s plaque. The \nvolume of reconstituted Xiapex to be administered into the plaque is 0.25 ml (for reconstitution \ninstructions, see section 6.6, Table 14). If more than one plaque is present, only the plaque causing the \ncurvature deformity should be injected. \n \nA treatment course consists of a maximum of 4 treatment cycles. Each treatment cycle consists of two \nXiapex injections and one penile modelling procedure. The second Xiapex injection is administered \n1 to 3 days after the first injection. A penile modelling procedure is performed 1 to 3 days after the \nsecond injection of each treatment cycle. The interval between treatment cycles is approximately six \nweeks. \n \nSpecial population \n \nElderly \nDue to the lack of quantifiable systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Dupuytren’s contracture \nand minimal and short-lived systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Peyronie’s disease, no dose \nadjustment is necessary. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between \nelderly and younger patients. \n \nHepatic impairment \nDue to the lack of quantifiable systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Dupuytren’s contracture \nand minimal and short-lived systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Peyronie’s disease, no dose \nadjustment is necessary. \n \nRenal impairment \nDue to the lack of quantifiable systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Dupuytren’s contracture \nand minimal and short-lived systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Peyronie’s disease, no dose \nadjustment is necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Xiapex in the paediatric population aged 0-18 years for the treatment of \nDupuytren’s contracture. \n \nPeyronie’s disease occurs exclusively in adult male patients and hence there is no relevant use of \nXiapex in the paediatric population aged 0-18 years for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntralesional use. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nXiapex must be reconstituted with the solvent provided and to the appropriate volume prior to \nintralesional injection (see section 6.6). \nA single-use syringe containing 0.01-ml graduations with a permanently fixed 27-gauge 12 or 13 mm \nneedle (not supplied) should be used to withdraw the volume of reconstituted solution. There will be a \nsmall amount of reconstituted solution left in the vial. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \n \nInjection procedure \nAdministration of a local anaesthetic medicinal product prior to injection of Xiapex into a Dupuytren’s \ncord is not recommended, as it may interfere with proper placement of the injection. \n \nThe joint to be treated (metacarpophalangeal [MP] or proximal interphalangeal [PIP]) should be \nconfirmed and the volume of solvent required for reconstitution is determined by the type of joint (PIP \njoint requires a smaller volume for injection). The injection procedure is detailed in the package leaflet \nand the physician training material and must be followed. \n \nPatients should be instructed: \n• To return to see their physician approximately 24-72 hours after injection for an examination of \n\nthe injected hand and a finger extension procedure to disrupt the cord. \n• Not to flex or extend the fingers of the injected hand to reduce extravasation of Xiapex out of \n\nthe cord until the finger extension procedure is completed. \n• Not to attempt to disrupt the injected cord by self-manipulation at any time. \n• To elevate the injected hand as much as possible until the day after the finger extension \n\nprocedure. \n \nFinger extension procedure \nAt the follow-up visit approximately 24-72 hours after injection, it should be determined if the \ncontracture has resolved. If a cord contracture remains, a passive finger extension procedure will be \nperformed in an attempt to disrupt the cord. Local anaesthesia may be used, if needed, during the \nfinger extension procedure. \nWhile the patient’s wrist is in the flexed position, a moderate stretching pressure should be applied to \nthe injected cord by extending the finger for approximately 10 to 20 seconds. For cords affecting the \nPIP joint, the finger extension procedure should be performed when the MP joint is in the flexed \nposition. If the first finger extension procedure does not result in disruption of the cord, a second and \nthird attempt can be performed at 5- to 10-minute intervals. No more than 3 attempts per affected joint \nare recommended to disrupt a cord. \n \nIf the cord has not disrupted after 3 attempts of extension, a follow-up visit may be scheduled \napproximately 4 weeks after the injection. If, at that subsequent visit the contracted cord persists, an \nadditional injection and finger extension procedure may be performed. \nFollowing the finger extension procedure(s) and fitting patient with a splint (with treated joint in \nmaximum extension), the patients should be instructed to: \n• Not perform strenuous activity with the injected hand until advised to do so. \n• Wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months. \n• Perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises several times a day for several \n\nmonths. \n \nPeyronie’s disease \n \nInjection procedure \nAdministration of regional anaesthesia (penile block) or topical anaesthesia could be applied prior to \nXiapex injection when desired. In the pivotal clinical studies about 30% of the patients received penile \nblock before injection. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nThe location of the target treatment area in the Peyronie’s plaque is identified at the point of maximum \nconcavity (or focal point) in the erect penis state and marked with a surgical marker. Xiapex should be \ninjected into the target plaque when the penis is in a flaccid state. The injection procedure is detailed \nin the package leaflet and the physician training material and must be followed. \n \nPenile modelling procedure \nPenile modelling helps relieve curvature deformity and straighten the penile shaft. At the follow-up \nvisit 1 to 3 days after the second injection of each treatment cycle, the trained physician should \nperform a penile modelling procedure on the flaccid penis to stretch and elongate the treated plaque \nthat Xiapex has disrupted. Local anaesthesia may be applied before the modelling if desired. Wearing \ngloves the physician should grasp the plaque or indurated portion of the flaccid penis about 1 cm \nproximal and distal to the injection site. Direct pressure on the injection site should be avoided. The \ntarget plaque is used as a fulcrum point with both hands, to firmly apply a steady pressure to elongate \nand stretch the plaque. The goal is to gradually create bending opposite to the patient’s penile \ncurvature, with stretching to the point of moderate resistance. \nThe penile pressure should be hold for 30 seconds, thereafter released with a resting period for \n30 seconds before repeating the penile modelling technique for a total of 3 modelling attempts at \n30 seconds for each attempt. \n \nIn addition to the in-office penile modelling procedure, patients should be provided instructions on the \nappropriate technique to self-perform penile modelling activities at home each day for the 6-week \nperiod following the physician penile plaque modelling visit of each treatment cycle, according to the \ndetailed instructions provided in the package leaflet. \n \nIf the curvature deformity is less than 15 degrees after the first, second or third treatment cycle, or if \nthe physician determines that further treatment is not clinically indicated, then the subsequent \ntreatment cycles should not be administered. \n \nThe safety of more than one treatment course of Xiapex for Peyronie’s disease is not known. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nTreatment of Peyronie’s plaques that involve the penile urethra due to potential risk to this structure. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nAllergic reactions \nFollowing Xiapex injection, severe allergic reaction could occur, and patients should be observed for \n30 minutes before leaving the clinic in order to monitor for any signs or symptoms of a serious allergic \nreaction, e.g. wide spread redness or rash, swelling, tightness in the throat or difficulty breathing. \nPatients should be instructed to consult a doctor immediately if they experience any of these signs or \nsymptoms. Emergency medication for treatment of potential allergic reactions should be available. \n \nAn anaphylactic reaction was reported in a post-marketing clinical study in a patient who had previous \nexposure to Xiapex for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture, demonstrating that severe reactions \nincluding anaphylaxis can occur following Xiapex injections. Some patients with Dupuytren’s \ncontracture developed IgE-anti-drug antibodies in greater proportions and higher titers with successive \nXiapex injections. \n \nIn the double-blind portion of the three phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies in Dupuytren’s \ncontracture, 17% of Xiapex-treated patients had mild reactions (i.e. pruritus) after up to 3 injections. \nThe incidence of Xiapex-associated pruritus increased after more Xiapex injections in patients with \nDupuytren’s contracture. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn the double-blind portion of the two phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials in Peyronie’s disease, a \ngreater proportion of Xiapex-treated patients (4%) compared to placebo-treated patients (1%) had \nlocalized pruritus after up to 4 treatment cycles (involving up to 8 Xiapex injections). The incidence of \nXiapex-associated pruritus was similar after each injection regardless of the number of injections \nadministered. \n \nTendon rupture or other serious injury to the injected finger/hand in the treatment of Dupuytren’s \ncontracture \nXiapex must only be injected into the Dupuytren’s cord. Because Xiapex lyses collagen, care must be \ntaken to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or other collagen-containing structures of \nthe hand. Injection of Xiapex into collagen containing structures may result in damage to those \nstructures, and possible permanent injury such as tendon rupture or ligament damage. Care should be \ntaken when injecting Xiapex into cords contracting the PIP joints as clinical studies indicate an \nincreased risk of tendon rupture and ligament injury associated with treatment of PIP contractures with \nXiapex. This is particularly important for cords situated at the PIP joint of the fifth finger. When \ninjecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger, the needle insertion must not be more than 2 to \n3 mm in depth and not more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease. Patients should be \ninstructed to comply with the treatment instructions (see section 4.2) and to promptly contact the \nphysician if there is trouble bending the finger after the swelling goes down (symptoms of tendon \nrupture). \n \nMost patients experiencing tendon/ligament rupture or injury have gone on to have successful surgical \nrepair. Early diagnosis and prompt evaluation and treatment are important because tendon \nrupture/ligament injury may potentially affect overall hand function. \n \nPatients with Dupuytren’s contractures that adhere to the skin may be at higher risk of skin lesions as a \nresult of the pharmacological effect of Xiapex and the finger extension procedure on the skin \noverlying the targeted cord. \n \nCases of skin laceration requiring skin graft after finger extension procedures have been reported post-\nmarketing. Signs or symptoms that may reflect serious injury to the treated finger/hand after injection \nor manipulation should be promptly evaluated because surgical intervention may be required. A higher \nrate for skin laceration has been shown following two concurrent injections in the same hand in a \ncontrolled post-marketing trial (see also Section 4.8). \n \nCases of finger necrosis have been reported, which in some cases led to amputation of finger parts. \nPre-existing reduced peripheral circulation, e.g. Raynaud syndrome, and the use of epinephrine \ncombined with local anaesthetics in these patients may contribute to this (see also section 4.8). \n \nCases of digital phalangeal fractures have been reported after finger manipulation procedure. Caution \nshould be exercised when performing finger extension procedures in patients with bone fragility, \nwhich may predispose to digital phalangeal fracture (e.g. in patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis). \nDiagnostic imaging is recommended after manipulation if finger deformity, pain or increased swelling \ndevelops (see also section 4.8). \n \nCorporal rupture (fracture of penis) or other serious injury to the penis in the treatment of Peyronie’s \ndisease \nInjection of Xiapex into collagen-containing structures such as the corpora cavernosa of the penis may \nresult in damage to those structures and possible injury such as corporal rupture (penile fracture). \nTherefore, Xiapex must be injected only into the Peyronie’s plaque and care should be taken to avoid \ninjecting into the urethra, nerves, blood vessels, corpora cavernosa or other collagen-containing \nstructures of the penis. \n \nCorporal rupture was reported as a serious adverse reaction after Xiapex injection in 5 out of \n1044 patients (0.5%) in the controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in Peyronie’s disease. In other \nXiapex-treated patients (9 of 1044; 0.9%), a combination of penile ecchymoses or haematoma, sudden \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n\npenile detumescence, and/or a penile “popping” sound or sensation was reported, and in these cases, a \ndiagnosis of corporal rupture cannot be excluded. \n \nSevere penile haematoma was also reported as an adverse reaction in 39 of 1044 patients (3.7%) in the \ncontrolled and uncontrolled clinical studies in Peyronie’s disease. \n \nPhysicians should advise the patient to wait for at least 4 weeks after the second injection of a \ntreatment cycle before resuming sexual activity taking care to ensure that any pain and swelling has \nceased and to be cautious when resuming sexual activity. \n \nSigns or symptoms that may reflect serious injury to the penis should be promptly evaluated in order \nto assess for corporal rupture or severe penile haematoma, which may require surgical intervention. \n \nUse in patients with coagulation disorders \nXiapex must be used with caution in patients with coagulation disorders or those taking \nanticoagulants. In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in Dupuytren’s \ncontracture, 73% of Xiapex-treated patients reported an ecchymosis or a contusion and 38% reported a \nhaemorrhage at the injection site. In the two double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in \nPeyronie’s disease, 65.5% of Xiapex-treated patients developed penile haematoma and 14.5% \ndeveloped penile ecchymosis. The efficacy and safety of Xiapex in patients receiving anticoagulant \nmedicinal products other than up to 150 mg acetylsalicylic acid per day prior to Xiapex administration \nis not known. Use of Xiapex in patients who have received anticoagulants (with the exception of up to \n150 mg acetylsalicylic acid daily) within 7 days prior to receiving an injection of Xiapex is not \nrecommended. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with any non-human protein medicinal product, patients may develop antibodies to the therapeutic \nprotein. During clinical studies, blood samples from patients with Dupuytren’s contracture and \nPeyronie’s disease were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to the protein components of the \nmedicinal product (AUX-I and AUX-II). \n \nIn the Dupuytren’s contracture clinical trials at 30 days post the first injection, 92% of patients had \ncirculating antibodies detected against AUX-I and 86% of patients against AUX-II. At five years after \nthe initial injection of Xiapex, 92.8% and 93.4% of subjects were seropositive for anti-AUX-I and \nanti-AUX-II respectively. \n \nAlmost all patients had positive titers for anti-AUX-I antibodies (97.9%) and anti-AUX-II antibodies \n(97.5%) 60 days post two concurrent injections. \n \nIn the Peyronie’s disease clinical studies, at 6 weeks after the first treatment cycle of Xiapex, \napproximately 75% of patients had antibodies against AUX-I and approximately 55% of patients had \nantibodies against AUX-II. Six weeks after the eighth injection (fourth treatment cycle) of Xiapex \n>99% of Xiapex-treated patients developed high titers of antibodies to both AUX-I and AUX-II. \nNeutralizing antibodies were assayed for a subset of 70 samples selected to be representative of high \nand low titer binding antibody responses at week 12 of treatment. For each subject in whom a \nWeek 12 sample was selected, the corresponding Week 6, 18, 24, and 52 samples were assayed if they \nwere also binding antibody positive. Neutralizing antibodies to AUX-I or AUX-II, were detected in \n60% and 51.8%, respectively, of patients tested. At five years after the initial injection of Xiapex the \nmajority of subjects (>90%) were seropositive for anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies. In \naddition, seropositivity for neutralizing anti-AUX-I and anti-AUX-II antibodies was maintained. \n \nIn patients treated for these two indications, there was no apparent correlation of antibody frequency, \nantibody titers, or neutralizing status to clinical response or adverse reactions. \n \nSince the enzymes in Xiapex have some sequence homology with human matrix metalloproteinases \n(MMPs), anti-drug antibodies (ADA) could theoretically interfere with human MMPs. No safety \nconcerns related to the inhibition of endogenous MMPs have been observed, in particular no adverse \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n\nevents indicating the development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases or the development of a \nmusculoskeletal syndrome (MSS). Whilst there is no clinical evidence from the current safety data of a \nmusculoskeletal syndrome developing following the administration of Xiapex, the potential for it to \noccur cannot be excluded. If this syndrome were to develop, it would occur progressively and is \ncharacterized by one or more of the following signs and symptoms: arthralgia, myalgia, joint stiffness, \nstiffness of the shoulders, hand oedema, palmar fibrosis and thickening or nodules forming in the \ntendons. \n \nPost-treatment surgery \nThe impact of treatment with Xiapex on subsequent surgery, if needed, is not known. \n \nSpecial penile conditions/diseases not studied in clinical trials \nXiapex treatment in patients having a calcified plaque that could have interfered with the injection \ntechnique, chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias, thrombosis of the dorsal penile artery \nand/or vein, infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile curvature, infiltration by an \ninfectious agent, such as in lymphogranuloma venereum, ventral curvature from any cause and \nisolated hourglass deformity of the penis has not been studied and treatment in these patients should be \navoided. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium- free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal medicinal product interaction studies with Xiapex have been performed. There is no \nquantifiable systemic exposure following a single injection of Xiapex in patients with Dupuytren’s \ncontracture and only minimal and short-lived systemic exposure of Xiapex in patients with Peyronie’s \ndisease. \n \nThere were no clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of adverse events following treatment \nwith Xiapex based on the severity of baseline erectile dysfunction or concomitant phosphodiesterase \ntype 5 (PDE5) inhibitor use. \n \nWhilst there is no clinical evidence of an interaction between tetracycline and \nanthracycline/anthraquinolone antibiotics and anthraquinone derivatives and Xiapex, such \nderivatives have been shown to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-mediated collagen degradation at \npharmacologically relevant concentrations in vitro. Therefore, use of Xiapex in patients who have \nreceived tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) within 14 days prior to receiving an injection of \nXiapex is not recommended. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and fertility \nFor Xiapex no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, or embryonal/foetal development, \n(see section 5.3). Parturition or postnatal development studies in animals were not conducted since \nhuman pharmacokinetic studies show that Xiapex levels are not quantifiable in the systemic \ncirculation following injection into a Dupuytren’s cord (see section 5.1). Patients develop ADAs after \nrepeated administration, the cross-reactivity of which versus endogenous MMPs involved in \npregnancy and labour cannot be excluded. The potential risk for humans on parturition and postnatal \ndevelopment is unknown. Therefore, the use of Xiapex is not recommended in pregnancy and \ntreatment should be postponed until after pregnancy. \n \nPeyronie’s disease occurs exclusively in adult male patients and hence there is no relevant information \nfor use in females. Low levels of Xiapex were quantifiable in the plasma of evaluable male patients for \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\nup to 30 minutes following administration of Xiapex into the penile plaque of patients with Peyronie’s \ndisease (see section 5.2). \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether collagenase clostridium histolyticum is excreted in human milk. Caution \nshould be exercised when Xiapex is administered to a breast-feeding woman. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nXiapex may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to the swelling and \npain which may impair the use of the treated hand in Dupuytren’s disease. Other minor influences on \nthe ability to drive and use machines include dizziness, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, and headache that \nhave also been reported following injection of Xiapex. Patients must be instructed to avoid potentially \nhazardous tasks such as driving or using machines until it is safe to do so or as advised by the \nphysician. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions during the Xiapex clinical studies (272 of 409 patients \nreceived up to three single injections of Xiapex and 775 patients received two concurrent injections in \nthe same hand) were local injection site reactions such as oedema peripheral (local to the injection \nsite), contusion (including ecchymosis), injection site haemorrhage and injection site pain. Injection \nsite reactions were very common, occurring in the vast majority of patients, were mostly mild to \nmoderate in severity and generally subsided within 1-2 weeks post injection. Serious adverse reactions \nof tendon rupture (6 cases), tendonitis (1 case), other ligament injury (2 cases) and complex regional \npain syndrome (1 case) related to the medicinal product were reported. Anaphylactic reaction was \nreported in a patient previously treated with Xiapex (1 case). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 1 presents adverse reactions listed by system organ class and frequency categories, using the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), and uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), and not known: cannot be estimated from the available data. Within each frequency group, \nadverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions reported from the \nclinical programme are those that occurred in the Phase 3 double blind placebo-controlled studies for \nthe treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture in adult patients with a palpable cord (AUX-CC-857, \nAUX-CC-859) and the post-marketing clinical studies (AUX-CC-864, AUX-CC-867) for two \nconcurrent injections in the same hand. \n \n\nTable 1: Tabulated list of adverse reactions. \n \nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n  Injection site \ncellulitis \nLymphangitis \n \n\n \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nLymphadenopathy Lymph node \npain \n\nThrombocytopenia \nLymphadenitis \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity \nAnaphylactic \nreaction \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  Disorientation \nAgitation \nInsomnia \nIrritability \nRestlessness \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n \n\n Paresthesia \nHypoesthesia \nBurning \nsensation \nDizziness \nHeadache \n\nComplex regional \npain syndrome \nMonoplegia \nSyncope \nvasovagal \nTremor \nHyperaesthesia \n \n\n \n\nEye disorders   Eyelid oedema \n \n\n \n\nVascular disorders   Haematoma \nHypotension \n \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n  Dyspnoea \nHyperventilation  \n \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Nausea Diarrhoea \nVomiting \nAbdominal pain \nupper \n \n\n \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritus \nEcchymosis \n \n \n\nBlood blistera \nBlister \nRash \nErythema \nHyperhidrosis  \n \n\nErythematous or \nmacular rash \nEczema \nSwelling face  \nSkin disorders, \nlike exfoliation, \nlesions, pain, \ntightness, \ndiscoloration or \nscab \n \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nPain in extremity Arthralgia \nAxillary mass \nJoint swelling \nMyalgia \n \n\nPain in chest wall, \ngroin, neck or \nshoulder \nMusculoskeletal \ndiscomfort or \nstiffness, joint \nstiffness or \ncrepitation \nLimb discomfort \nTendonitis \nMuscle spasms or \nweakness \n \n\n \n\nReproductive \nsystem and breast \ndisorders \n\n  Breast tenderness \nHypertrophy \nbreast \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n\nSystem organ class Very common Common Uncommon Not known \nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nOedema \nperipheralc \nInjection site \nhaemorrhage, \npain or swelling \nTenderness \n \n\nAxillary pain \nInflammation \nInjection site \nwarmth, \nerythema, \ninflammation, \nvesicles or \npruritus \nSwelling \n \n\nLocal swelling \nPyrexia \nPain \nDiscomfort \nFatigue \nFeeling hot \nInfluenza like \nillness \nInjection site \nreaction, malaise, \nirritation, \nanaesthesia, \ndesquamation, \nnodule or \ndiscoloration \nCold intolerance \nof the treated \nfingers \n \n\n \n\nInvestigations   Lymph node \npalpable \nAlanine \naminotransferase \nincreased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased \nBody temperature \nincreased \n \n\n \n\nInjury, poisoning \nand procedural \ncomplications \n\nContusion Skin \nlacerationa,b \n\nTendon rupture \nLigament injury \nLimb injury \nOpen wound \nWound dehiscence \n \n\nDigital necrosisd \nDigital fractured \n\na reported with a higher incidence (very common) in patients who received two concurrent \ninjections of Xiapex in the same hand compared with subjects treated with up to three single \ninjections in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled pivotal studies in Dupuytren’s contracture. \n\nb “skin laceration” includes “injection site laceration” and “laceration” \nc “oedema peripheral” includes “injection site oedema” and “oedema” \nd see also section 4.4 \n \nThe incidence of skin laceration (29.1%) was higher for subjects treated with two concurrent \ninjections of Xiapex in historically-controlled clinical study AUX-CC-867 compared with subjects \ntreated with up to three single injections in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled pivotal studies in \nDupuytren’s contracture (CORD I and CORD II) (8.8%). The majority of the skin lacerations occurred \non the manipulation day. A higher incidence of skin laceration may be attributable to more vigorous \nfinger extension procedures in patients after receiving anaesthesia to the hand. In Study AUX-CC-867, \nmost (85%) subjects received local anaesthesia prior to the finger extension procedure. \nThere were no other clinically relevant differences between two concurrent injections of Xiapex in the \nsame hand and up to three single injections of Xiapex in the types of adverse events reported (i.e., \nmost adverse events were local to the treated extremity and of mild or moderate intensity). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nThe overall safety profile was similar regardless of the timing of the post-injection finger extension \nprocedure (i.e., 24 hours, 48 hours, and ≥72 hours after injection) among patients who received two \nconcurrent injections of Xiapex in Study AUX-CC-867. \n \nPeyronie’s disease \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe overall safety profile was similar in the two Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled studies \n(832 male patients, 551 patients received Xiapex) and in an open-label Phase 3 study (189 male \npatients) of patients who had previously received placebo in the controlled studies. In the two Phase 3 \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled studies, most adverse reactions were local events of the penis and \ngroin and the majority of these events were of mild or moderate severity, and most (79%) resolved \nwithin 14 days of the injection. The adverse reaction profile was similar after each injection, \nregardless of the number of injections administered. The most frequently reported adverse drug \nreactions (≥25%) during the Xiapex controlled clinical studies were penile haematoma, penile swelling \nand penile pain. Severe penile haematoma including severe injection site haematoma were reported \nwith the frequency very common. \n \nIn the controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies of Xiapex in Peyronie’s disease corporal rupture and \nother serious penile injury were reported uncommonly (see section 4.4) \n \nA popping noise or popping sensation in the penis, sometimes described as “snapping” or “cracking” \nand sometimes accompanied by detumescence, haematoma and/or pain, were reported in 73/551 \n(13.2%) Xiapex-treated patients and 1/281 (0.3%) placebo-treated patients, in Studies 1 and 2 \ncombined. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 presents adverse reactions listed by system organ class and frequency categories, using the \nfollowing convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100), and not known: cannot be estimated from the available data.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAdministration of Xiapex at greater than recommended doses is expected to be associated with \nincreased local reactions at the site of injection. Routine supportive care and symptomatic treatment \nmust be provided in the case of overdose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other Drugs For Disorders of the Musculo-Skeletal System-Enzymes, \nATC code: M09AB02  \n \nXiapex is a lyophilized product for parenteral administration containing collagenase clostridium \nhistolyticum which is comprised of two collagenases in a defined mass ratio. These collagenases, \nreferred to as AUX-I and AUX-II, are representative of the two major collagenase classes (Class I and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n15 \n\nClass II) produced by Clostridium histolyticum. AUX-I and AUX-II are single polypeptide chains \nconsisting of approximately 1000 amino acids of known sequence with a molecular weight of 114 kDa \nand 113 kDa respectively as determined by mass spectrometry. The two polypeptides are purified by \nchromatographic steps customary for the separation and isolation of biotherapeutic proteins to yield a \nconsistent, well characterized and controlled mixture of two collagenase enzymes. \n \nBecause the collagen lysis process following Xiapex administration is localized and does not require \nor result in quantifiable systemic levels of AUX-I and AUX-II, the primary pharmacodynamic activity \nof Xiapex cannot be evaluated in subjects and therefore, such studies have not been undertaken. \n \nMechanism of action \nCollagenases are proteinases that hydrolyze collagen under physiological conditions. Xiapex is \ncomprised of a mixture of Class I (AUX-I) and Class II (AUX-II) clostridial collagenases in a defined \nmass ratio. The two classes of collagenases have similar but complementary substrate specificity. Both \ncollagenases effectively cleave interstitial collagen but at different sites on the molecule; additionally, \nthey prefer different conformations (triple helical versus denatured or cleaved). These differences \naccount for the ability of the two classes of enzymes to digest collagen in a complementary manner. \nClass I collagenases (α, β, γ, and η) are the products of the colG gene, they initiate collagen hydrolysis \nnear the amino and carboxy termini of triple helical domains and generate large proteolytic fragments. \nIn contrast, the Class II collagenases (δ, ε, and ζ,) are products of colH gene, their initial cleavage sites \nare located within the interior of the collagen molecule and generate smaller collagen fragments. Both \nclasses of collagenases readily hydrolyze gelatin (denatured collagen) and small collagen peptides, \nwhereas Class II has higher affinity for small collagen fragments. Class I cleaves insoluble triple \nhelical collagen with higher affinity than Class II collagenase. Together, these collagenases work to \nprovide broad hydrolytic activity towards collagen. \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \nInjection of Xiapex into a Dupuytren’s cord, which is comprised mostly of interstitial collagen types I \nand III, results in enzymatic disruption of the cord. \n \nPeyronie’s disease \nThe signs and symptoms of Peyronie’s disease are caused by a collagen plaque. Injection of Xiapex \ninto a Peyronie’s plaque, which is comprised mostly of collagen, may result in enzymatic disruption of \nthe plaque. Following this disruption of the plaque, penile curvature deformity and patient bother \ncaused by Peyronie’s disease are reduced. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \nThe efficacy of Xiapex 0.58 mg was evaluated in two pivotal randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies, CORD I (AUX-CC-857) and CORD II (AUX-CC-859), in adult patients \nwith Dupuytren’s contracture. The double-blind study population comprised 409 patients of whom \n272 received Xiapex 0.58 mg and 137 received placebo. The mean age was 63 years (range 33 to \n89 years) and 80% of patients were male. At study entry, patients in the clinical studies had: (1) a \nfinger flexion contracture with a palpable cord of at least one finger (other than the thumb) of 20° to \n100° in a MP joint or 20° to 80° in PIP joint and (2) a positive “table top test” defined as the inability to \nsimultaneously place the affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top. The cord affecting a \nselected primary joint received up to 3 injections of 0.58 mg of Xiapex or placebo. A finger extension \nprocedure was performed if needed, approximately 24 hours after injection to facilitate disruption of \nthe cord. Each injection was separated by approximately 4 weeks. \n \nThe primary endpoint of each study was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved a \nreduction in contracture of the selected primary joint (MP or PIP) to 5° or less of normal, \napproximately 4 weeks after the last injection of that joint.

Time of finger extension after \ninjection had no impact on the rate of clinical success for either MP or PIP joints. Clinically \nmeaningful improvement in hand function as determined by the URAM (Unite´ Rhumatologique des \nAffections de la Main) score was observed at Day 31 (-11.3) and Day 61 (-12.3). \n \nLong-term efficacy and safety \nA long-term, non-treatment, Year 2 to Year 5 follow-up study (AUX-CC-860) was undertaken to \nevaluate recurrence of contracture and long-term safety in subjects who received up to 8 single \ninjections of Xiapex 0.58 mg in a previous Phase 3 open-label or double-blind with open-label \nextension study. No new safety signals were identified among subjects who were followed for 5 years \nafter their initial injection of Xiapex in a previous clinical study. The majority of adverse events \nreported during the long-term follow-up period were non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and \nwere not related to the local administration of Xiapex. These data support the long-term safety profile \nof Xiapex confirming that no new safety risks were identified during the 5 year follow-up period. \n \nRecurrence was assessed in successfully treated joints (i.e., subjects had a reduction in contracture to \n5° or less at the Day 30 evaluation after the last injection of Xiapex in a previous study) and was \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\ndefined as an increase in joint contracture by at least 20° in the presence of a palpable cord, or the joint \nunderwent medical or surgical intervention primarily to correct a new or worsening Dupuytren’s \ncontracture in that joint.

The \n\nduration of assessment started at the day of success (visit after the last injection where the 0° \nto 5° measurement was first recorded). The duration of assessment ended at the last available \nmeasurement or at the day of medical intervention for joints that did not recur and the \nrecurrence day for recurrent joints. \n\nb A recurrent joint was a joint evaluated by the investigator as having a worsening Dupuytren's \ncontracture due to a palpable cord. The recurrence day was the visit where the recurrence \nwas reported or the day of intervention if a joint was treated for a worsening Dupuytren's \ncontracture. For joints reported as recurring in a previous study, the day of recurrence was \nthe first visit with a fixed flexion contracture measurement of 20° or greater following the \nreport of recurrence. \n\nc The nominal rate of recurrence was the total number of recurrences occurring prior to the last \nday of the interval divided by the total number of joints (×100).  \n\n \nRetreatment of recurrent contractures \nA study AUX-CC-862 was conducted in patients with Dupuytren's contracture who had recurrence of \ncontracture in a joint that was effectively treated with Xiapex in a previous clinical study. No new \nsafety signals were identified among subjects who were retreated with Xiapex. Most adverse events \nwere non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and related to the local administration of Xiapex or to \nthe finger extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption. The clinical efficacy in study \nAUX-CC-862 was similar to that reported in studies CORD I and CORD II. In study AUX-CC-862, \n64.5% of recurrent MP joints and 45.0% of recurrent PIP joints achieved clinical success after \nretreatment with up to three injections of Xiapex. \n \nIn the retreatment study AUX-CC-862, 150 anti-AUX-I antibody positive samples and 149 \nanti-AUX-II antibody positive samples were assessed for potential cross-reactivity with human \nMMPs-1, -2, -3, -8, and -13. Results showed no cross-reactivity with any of the five MMPs tested. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXiapex in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nPeyronie’s disease \nThe efficacy of Xiapex was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, \nStudy 1 (AUX-CC-803) and Study 2 (AUX-CC-804), in adult males with Peyronie’s disease. The \ndouble–blind study population comprised 832 male patients of whom 551 patients received Xiapex \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n20 \n\nand 281 received placebo. The median age was 58 years (range 23 to 84 years). At study entry, \npatients must have had penile curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees in the stable phase of \nPeyronie’s disease. Patients were excluded if they had a ventral curvature deformity, an isolated \nhourglass deformity or a calcified plaque that could have interfered with the injection technique. At \nbaseline, penile pain was either not present or was mild in most (98%) patients. \n \nIn these studies, patients were given up to 4 treatment cycles of Xiapex or placebo (weeks 0, 6, 12, \n18), and were followed in a non-treatment follow-up period (weeks 24-52). In each treatment cycle, \ntwo injections of Xiapex 0.58 mg or two injections of placebo were administered 1 to 3 days apart. A \npenile modelling procedure was performed on patients at the study site 1 to 3 days after the second \ninjection of the cycle. The treatment cycle was repeated at approximately six-week intervals for up to \nthree additional times, for a maximum of 8 total injection procedures and 4 total modelling \nprocedures. In addition, patients were instructed to perform penile modelling at home for six weeks \nafter each treatment cycle. \nIn Studies 1 and 2, the co-primary endpoints were: \n• the percent change from baseline to Week 52 in penile curvature deformity and \n• the change from baseline to Week 52 in the Bother domain of the Peyronie’s Disease \n\nQuestionnaire (PDQ) \n \nThe Bother domain score is a composite of the following patient-reported items: concern about \nerection pain, erection appearance, and the impact of Peyronie’s disease on intercourse and on \nfrequency of intercourse. \n \nXiapex treatment significantly improved penile curvature deformity in patients with Peyronie’s \ndisease compared with placebo (Table 9). The improvement in curvature deformity was numerically \nsimilar among patients with baseline deformity from 30 to 60 degrees and those with curvature \ndeformity from 61 to 90 degrees. \n \nXiapex significantly reduced patient-reported bother associated with Peyronie’s disease compared \nwith placebo (Table 10). The reduction in the Bother domain score was numerically similar between \npatient groups stratified by degree of baseline curvature deformity (30 to 60 degrees and 61 to \n90 degrees). \n \nTable 8 provides the baseline disease characteristics for the study population and Tables 9 -10 provide \nthe results of the co-primary efficacy endpoints measured in the 2 double-blind placebo-controlled \nstudies AUX-CC-803 and AUX-CC-804. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 8.

At baseline, the mean (SD) Female PDQ score \nwas 4.7 (3.61) and 2.7 (3.06) at week 36, i.e. a change from baseline of -2.0. The mean (SD) FSFI \nscore was 20.56 (10.08) at baseline and 26.72 (7.73) at week 36, a change from baseline of 7.54. \n \nLong-term efficacy and safety \nA phase 4, non-treatment, long-term follow-up study (AUX-CC-810) was undertaken to evaluate the \nefficacy and safety up to 5 years after the first injection of Xiapex in the pivotal 12-month double-\nblind placebo-controlled phase 3 studies or in the 9-month open-label phase 3 studies. Through the \n5 year follow up period (Table 13), subjects demonstrated an improvement in penile curvature and in \nPDQ bother compared with the last observed value from the previous phase 3 studies. There were no \nchanges in the international index of erectile function (IIEF) scores. No new safety signals were \nidentified during the 5 year follow-up period. \n \n\nTable 13: Long Term Efficacy variables – study AUX-CC-810 \n \n\n Baselinea Referenceb Year 2 Year 3  Year 4 Year 5  \nCurvature* \n(degrees) N=247 N=247 N=51 N=43 N=225 N=180 \n\nMean±SD 51.8±15.04 31.0±16.10 25.8±12.99 25.2±13.31 29.1±17.21 27.0±16.13 \nMedian 50.0 30.0 26.0 27.0 30.0 29.5 \n\nMin, Max 30, 90 0, 81 0, 55 0, 60 0, 85 0, 70 \nPDQ \nbother** N=183 N=183 N=34 N=29 N=154 N=123 \n\nMean±SD 6.5±3.47 3.4±3.30 3.2±3.30 2.7±2.84 2.5±3.01 2.4±2.89 \nMedian 6.0 2.0 2.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 \n\nMin, Max 0, 15 0, 14 0, 14 0, 9 0, 12 0, 13 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n24 \n\n Baselinea Referenceb Year 2 Year 3  Year 4 Year 5  \nIIEF erectile \nfunction**  N=181 N=183 N=37 N=31 N=167 N=134 \n\nMean±SD 23.2±6.47 24.9±6.12 22.9±7.70 22.9±8.13 23.3±7.54 23.6±7.48 \nMedian 26.0 27.0 26.0 26.0 27.0 27.0 \n\nMin, Max 2, 30 3, 30 3, 30 1, 30 3, 30 1, 30 \n \n\na Baseline was defined as the last observation prior to the first injection of Xiapex in the previous \nphase 3 study (i.e AUX-CC-802, AUX-CC-803, AUX-CC-804 or AUX-CC-806) \nb Reference was defined as the last post-baseline non-missing observed value from the previous \nphase 3 study (i.e AUX-CC-802, AUX-CC-803, AUX-CC-804 or AUX-CC-806) \n* Note: 29 subjects were excluded from this analysis. 9 subjects received commercial Xiapex and 2 \nsubjects had penile implant during the course of the non-treatment study (AUX-CC-810), and 18 \nsubjects had prior surgical intervention for the treatment of Peyronie´s Disease. \n**Note: 22 subjects were excluded from this analysis. 9 subjects received commercial Xiapex and 1 \nsubject had penile implant during the course of the non-treatment study (AUX-CC-810), and 12 \nsubjects had prior surgical intervention for the treatment of Peyronie´s Disease. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nXiapex in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nFollowing administration of either a single dose of 0.58 mg of Xiapex to 16 patients with Dupuytren’s \ncontracture, or two concurrent injections of 0.58 mg of Xiapex in the same hand in 12 patients \nwith Dupuytren's contracture, no quantifiable levels of Xiapex were detected in plasma from \n5 minutes to 30 days post injection. \n \nFollowing each of two intralesional administrations, separated by 24 hours, of Xiapex 0.58 mg into the \npenile plaque of 19 patients with Peyronie’s disease, plasma levels of AUX-I and AUX-II in patients \nwith quantifiable levels (82% and 40% for AUX-I and AUX-II, respectively) were minimal and short-\nlived. The maximal individual plasma concentrations of AUX-I and AUX-II were <29 ng/mL and \n<71 ng/mL, respectively. All plasma levels were below the limits of quantification within 30 minutes \nfollowing dosing. There was no evidence of accumulation following two sequential injections of \nXiapex administered 24 hours apart. No patients had quantifiable plasma levels 15 minutes after \nmodelling of plaque on Day 3 (i.e., 24 hours after Injection 2 on Day 2). \n \nDistribution \nThere has been no evidence of systemic toxicity to date in the clinical studies conducted with Xiapex \nadministered through localized injection into the Dupuytren’s cord or into the Peyronie’s plaque. \n \nBiotransformation \nBecause Xiapex is not a substrate for cytochrome P450 or other medicinal product metabolizing \nenzyme pathways, and because no active metabolites are expected, no metabolism studies have been \nperformed. \n \nElimination \nNo formal studies on elimination have been performed. There is no quantifiable systemic exposure \nfollowing a single injection of Xiapex in patients with Dupuytren’s contracture and only minimal and \nshort-lived systemic exposure in patients with Peyronie’s disease. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n25 \n\nSpecial population \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in any special patient groups e.g., Elderly, Renally or Hepatically \nImpaired, by Gender or Race. \n \nPaediatric population \nXiapex has not been studied in children and adolescents aged 0-18 years and hence no \npharmacokinetic data are available. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeated dose toxicity \nIn a single-dose phase or 61-day repeat-dose phase (3 times a week every 3 weeks for 3 cycles) study \nof intrapenile administration of collagenase clostridium histolyticum in dogs at exposures lower than \nor equal to the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis, there was no evidence of \nsystemic toxicity. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nWhen Xiapex was given intravenously every other day to male and female rats before cohabitation \nand through mating and implantation, no effects on the oestrus cycle, tubal transport, implantation and \npre-implantation development and/or on libido or epididymal sperm maturation were noted with \nintravenous doses up to 0.13 mg/dose (approximately 11 times the human dose on a mg/m2 basis). \nThere were no adverse reactions on early embryonic development (indicating no evidence of \nteratogenicity) in rats. No systemic toxicity was observed in this study at any dose level. \n \nMutagenicity \nCollagenase clostridium histolyticum was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium (AMES test) and \nwas not clastogenic in both an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay and an in vitro chromosomal \naberration assay in human lymphocytes. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nStandard two-year rodent bioassays have not been performed with Xiapex. Thus, the carcinogenic risk \nis unknown. \n \n \n6.

Reconstituted Xiapex can be kept at ambient \nroom temperature (20ºC-25ºC) for up to one hour or refrigerated 2ºC-8˚C for up to 4 hours prior to \nadministration. If refrigerated, the reconstituted solution must be allowed to return to ambient room \ntemperature (20ºC-25ºC) for approximately 15 minutes before use. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2ºC-8ºC). \nDo not freeze. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nXiapex powder is supplied in a clear glass vial (3 ml, type I glass) with rubber stopper, aluminium seal \nand flip-off cap (polypropylene). \n \nSolvent: 3 ml solution supplied in a clear glass vial (5 ml, type I glass) with rubber stopper, aluminium \nseal and flip-off cap (polypropylene). \n \nPack of 1 vial of powder and 1 vial of solvent \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nInstructions for use and handling \n \nPreparation - Reconstitution procedure \n \nThe vial containing Xiapex and the vial containing the solvent for solution for injection for \nreconstitution must be refrigerated. Prior to use, the vial containing Xiapex and the vial containing the \nsolvent for solution for reconstitution must be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to stand at \nroom temperature for at least 15 minutes and no longer than 60 minutes. Each vial of Xiapex and \nsterile solvent for reconstitution should only be used for a single injection. If two cords of affected \njoints on the same hand are to be treated during a treatment visit, separate vials and syringes \nshould be used for each reconstitution and injection. \n \nUsing an aseptic technique, the following procedure for reconstitution must be followed: \n \n1. Dupuytren’s contracture: The joint to be treated (MP or PIP) should be confirmed as the volume \n\nof solvent required for reconstitution is determined by the type of joint (PIP joint requires a \nsmaller volume for injection). \nPeyronie’s disease: The treatment area should be identified and marked with a surgical marker \non the erected penis. \n\n \n2. The flip-off plastic caps should be removed from both vials. The rubber stopper and \n\nsurrounding surface of the vial containing Xiapex and the vial containing the solvent for \nreconstitution should be swabbed with sterile alcohol (no other antiseptics must be used). \n\n \n3. Only the supplied solvent must be used for reconstitution; it contains calcium which is required \n\nfor the activity of Xiapex. Using a sterile syringe calibrated with 0.01 ml graduations, the \nappropriate amount of solvent supplied should be withdrawn in order to deliver as follows: \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 14.

The \nsolution should slowly be swirled to ensure that all of the lyophilised powder has gone into \nsolution. The syringe and needle used for reconstitution are thereafter removed and discarded. \n\n \n5. The solution should visually be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \n\nadministration. The reconstituted solution of Xiapex must be clear. If the solution contains \nparticles, is cloudy or discoloured, it should not be injected. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What Xiapex is and what it is used for \n \nXiapex is used for the treatment of two different conditions: Dupuytren’s contracture in adult \npatients with a palpable cord and Peyronie’s disease in adult men. \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \nThis is a disease that causes your finger(s) to bend inward. This bending is called a contracture and is \ncaused by the abnormal formation of a cord containing collagen under your skin. For many people, a \ncontracture causes significant difficulties with performing everyday tasks like driving, shaking hands, \nplaying sports, opening jars, typing or holding objects. \n \nPeyronie’s disease \nThis is a condition where adult men have a ‘plaque’ that can be felt and a curve to their penis. The \ndisease can cause a change in the shape of the erect penis due to the abnormal build-up of scar tissue, \nknown as a plaque, within the stretchy fibres of the penis. The plaque may interfere with the ability to \nget a straight erection because the plaque will not stretch as much as the rest of the penis. Men with \nPeyronie’s disease may have an erection that is curved or bent. \n \nThe active substance in Xiapex is collagenase clostridium histolyticum, and this collagenase is \nproduced using the microorganism Clostridium histolyticum. Xiapex is injected by your doctor into the \ncord in your finger/hand or plaque in your penis and works by breaking down the collagen in the cord \nor plaque. \nFor Dupuytren’s disease, Xiapex breaks down the collagen forming the cord and thereby releasing the \ncontracture completely or partly and enabling your finger(s) to be straighter. \nFor Peyronie’s disease, Xiapex breaks down the collagen in the plaque that is causing your erect penis \nto curve, which may help the previously bent erection to become straighter and enable you to feel less \nbothered by your disease. The reduction of the curve achieved will vary between individuals. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Xiapex \n \nYou must not be given Xiapex: \n• If you are allergic to collagenase clostridium histolyticum or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n• For Peyronie’s disease if the treatment of your plaque involves the tube (called the urethra) that \n\nyour urine passes through. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given Xiapex. \n \nAllergic reactions \nSevere allergic reactions can happen in patients who receive Xiapex, because it contains proteins \nforeign to the human body. \n \nCall your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms of an allergic reaction after an \ninjection of Xiapex: \n• hives \n• swollen face \n• breathing trouble \n• chest pain \n \nThe potential for a serious allergic reaction or the development of a musculoskeletal syndrome upon \nrepeated use of Xiapex cannot be excluded. The symptoms of musculoskeletal syndrome could be \njoint or muscle pain, shoulder stiffness, hand swelling, fibrosis of the palms, and thickening or nodule \nforming of tendons. If you notice such symptoms you should inform your doctor. \n \nBefore you are given this medicine, make sure your doctor knows: \n• if you have had an allergic reaction to a previous Xiapex injection. \n• if you have a history of problems with the normal clotting of your blood or if you are taking any \n\nmedicines to help control the normal clotting of your blood (known as anticoagulation \nmedicines). \n\n• if you are currently taking any anticoagulation medicines, you must not receive Xiapex within \n7 days of last dose of your anticoagulation medicine. One exception is the use of up to 150 mg \ndaily dose of acetylsalicylic acid (a substance present in many medicines used to prevent blood \nclotting) which can be taken. \n\n \nIf you are treated for Dupuytren’s contracture \n \nThis medicine must only be injected into the collagen cord in your hand by your doctor. Your doctor \nwill take care to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves or blood vessels. Incorrect injection into tendons, \nnerves or blood vessels may result in bleeding or damage and possible permanent injury to these \nstructures. If your cord to be treated is attached to the skin, you are at higher risk of the skin splitting \nor tearing during the finger extension procedure following the injection of Xiapex. \n \nSevere injury like e.g. finger necrosis or fracture could result in loss of finger or finger parts. Before \nfinger manipulation procedure will be performed tell your doctor, if you have a condition affecting \nyour bones, e.g. osteopenia or osteoporosis. Contact your doctor right away if you are concerned by \nincreasing pain or symptoms in the fingers after the treatment. \n \nTell your doctor if you have previously received or are thinking about receiving Xiapex to treat a \ncondition known as Peyronie's disease. This condition affects adult men, who have a ‘plaque’ that can \nbe felt and a curve to their erect penis. \n \nIf you are treated for Peyronie’s disease \n \nThis medicine must only be injected into the plaque in your penis by your doctor. \n \nPenile fracture (corporal rupture) or other serious injury to the penis \nReceiving an injection of Xiapex may cause damage to the tubes in your penis called the corpora. \nAfter treatment with Xiapex, one of these tubes may break during an erection. This is called a corporal \nrupture or penile fracture. \nAfter treatment with Xiapex, blood vessels in your penis may also break, causing blood to collect \nunder the skin (which is called a haematoma). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n40 \n\nSymptoms of penile fracture (corporal rupture) or other serious injury to your penis may include: \n• a popping sound or sensation in an erect penis \n• sudden loss of the ability to maintain an erection \n• pain in your penis \n• purple bruising and swelling of your penis \n• difficulty urinating or blood in the urine \n \nCall your doctor right away if you experience any of the symptoms of penile fracture or serious \ninjury to your penis listed above, as this may require surgical intervention. \nDo not have sex or have any other sexual activity for at least 4 weeks after the second injection of a \ntreatment cycle with Xiapex and after any pain and swelling has ceased and be cautious when \nresuming sexual activity. \n \nTell your doctor if you are thinking about receiving or have previously received Xiapex to treat a \ncondition known as Dupuytren’s contracture. In this condition, a cord forms in the tissue in the palm \nof the hand and causes one or more fingers to bend toward the palm so that they cannot be \nstraightened. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThere is no relevant use of Xiapex in children and adolescents aged 0-18 years for the treatment of \nDupuytren’s contracture or Peyronie’s disease. \n \nOther medicines and Xiapex \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This \nincludes medicines to help control the normal clotting of your blood (known as anticoagulation \nmedicines), anthraquinone derivatives, some antibiotics (tetracyclines and \nanthracyclines/anthraquinolones) used to treat infections. There are no known interactions with \nconcomitant use of medicines for erectile dysfunction and Xiapex treatment. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nDupuytren’s contracture \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this medicine. \nThere is no experience in the use of Xiapex in pregnant women therefore the use of Xiapex is not \nrecommended in pregnancy, and treatment should be postponed until after pregnancy. \n \nThere is no experience in the use of Xiapex in breast-feeding women therefore the use of Xiapex is not \nrecommended during breast-feeding. \n \nPeyronie's disease \nThis condition does not occur in females. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIf you experience dizziness, numbness or altered sensation, and headache immediately after an \ninjection of Xiapex you must avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or using machines until \nthese effects have passed or until advised by your doctor. \n \nSwelling and pain may impair the use of the treated hand in Dupuytren’s disease. \n \nXiapex contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n41 \n\n3. How Xiapex is used \n \nOnly doctors that have been appropriately trained in the correct use of Xiapex and are experienced in \nthe management of Dupuytren’s or Peyronie’s disease are allowed to give you treatment. \n \nYou will be given Xiapex as an injection directly into the area that is causing your finger/penis to bend \n(intralesional injection). Your doctor will perform all injections of Xiapex. \n \nThe recommended dose of your prescribed medicine is 0.58 mg. \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \nThe total volume of the injection depends on the joint being treated. Your doctor will carefully select \nan area where the collagen cord is best accessible and will proceed with the injection into the cord. \n \nAfter the injection, your doctor will place a dressing on your hand. You must limit motion of the \ntreated finger for a day and it is not uncommon for the finger to straighten on its own for some \npatients. Until advised by your doctor, do not flex or extend the fingers of the injected hand. Do not \nattempt to disrupt the injected cord by self manipulation at any time. Elevate the injected hand as \nmuch as possible until the day after the finger extension procedure. \n \nYour doctor will ask you to return approximately 24-72 hours after your injection to attempt to extend \nyour finger to straighten it. Following extension of your finger, your doctor will fit you with a splint to \nwear at bedtime for up to 4 months. \nIf your finger is still not able to straighten during a follow-up visit with your doctor, you may need \nadditional treatments with Xiapex which may be administered approximately 4 weeks after the first \ntreatment. Injections and finger extension procedures may be administered up to 3 times per cord at \napproximately 4-week intervals. Injections in up to two cords or two affected joints in the same hand \ncan be administered during a treatment visit. If the disease has resulted in multiple contractures, \nadditional cords may be treated at other treatment visits approximately 4 weeks apart, as determined \nby your doctor. \n \nBe sure to ask your doctor when you can resume normal activities after treatment with Xiapex. It is \nrecommended to avoid strenuous activities of your finger until instructed further by your doctor. Your \ndoctor may recommend you perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises several times a \nday for several months. \nClinical study experience with Xiapex is currently limited to up to 3 injections per cord and up to a \ntotal of 8 injections in the hands. \n \nPeyronie’s disease \nYour doctor will inject Xiapex into the plaque that is causing your penis to curve. \n \n• Xiapex is given as part of a treatment cycle. In each treatment cycle, you will receive one \n\ninjection of Xiapex, followed by a second injection on a separate day (1 to 3 days later). \n• After each injection of Xiapex, your penis may be wrapped with a bandage. Your doctor will tell \n\nyou when to remove the dressing. \n• One to three days after the second injection of Xiapex in a treatment cycle, you will need to \n\nreturn to your doctor for a manual procedure that will help stretch and help straighten your penis. \nYour doctor will tell you when to come back for this. \n\n• Your doctor will show you how to gently stretch and straighten your penis the right way. For \nfurther information see “Instructions on how to gently stretch your penis” and “Instructions \non how to gently straighten your penis” at the end of the Patient leaflet. \n\n• You should only gently stretch your penis when you do not have an erection. You should \ngently stretch your penis 3 times a day for 6 weeks after each treatment cycle. \n\n• You should only gently straighten your penis if you have an erection that happens without \nany sexual activity (spontaneous erection). You should gently straighten your penis 1 time a \nday for 6 weeks after each treatment cycle. \n\n• Your doctor will tell you when you can resume sexual activity after each treatment cycle. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n42 \n\n• Your doctor will also tell you when to come back if more treatment cycles are needed. \n \n\nClinical study experience with Xiapex is currently limited to four treatment cycles in which a total of 8 \ninjections may be administered into the plaque causing the curvature. \n \nTell your doctor right away if you have trouble stretching or straightening your penis, or if you have \npain or other concerns. \n \nIf you receive more Xiapex than you should \nAs this medicine is administered to you by your doctor it is very unlikely that you will be given an \nincorrect dose. In the unlikely event that your doctor administers a higher dose than recommended, \nyou may experience an increase in the severity of possible side effects listed in section 4 “Possible \nSide Effects”. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reaction \nSevere allergic reaction has been reported uncommonly (1 case). Please consult a doctor immediately \nif you experience any signs or symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, e.g., wide spread redness or \nrash, swelling, tightness in the throat or difficulty breathing. You must not be given Xiapex if you \nknow that you have had a serious allergic reaction to collagenase or any of the other ingredients. \n \nDupuytren’s contracture \n \nMost of the side effects that

How to store Xiapex \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nYour doctor must not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and vial \nlabel after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator at 2ºC-8ºC. Do not freeze. \n \nAfter reconstitution, immediate use of the medicine is recommended. Reconstituted Xiapex can be \nkept at ambient room temperature (20ºC-25ºC) for up to one hour or refrigerated at 2ºC-8˚C for up to \n4 hours prior to administration. If refrigerated, the reconstituted solution must be allowed to return to \nambient room temperature (20ºC-25ºC) for approximately 15 minutes before use. \n \nYour doctor must not use Xiapex if the reconstituted solution is discoloured or contains particles. The \nsolution must be clear, colourless with no lumps or flakes or particles. \n \nYour doctor will take care of storing, handling and disposing of Xiapex. Do not throw away any \nmedicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you \nno longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Xiapex contains \n• The active substance is collagenase clostridium histolyticum. Each vial of Xiapex contains \n\n0.9 mg of collagenase clostridium histolyticum. \n• The other ingredients are sucrose, trometamol and hydrochloric acid 2.4% w/w (for pH \n\nadjustment). \n• The solvent contains calcium chloride dihydrate, sodium chloride and water for injections. \n \nWhat Xiapex looks like and contents of the pack \nXiapex is a powder and solvent for solution for injection.

Preparation - Reconstitution procedure \n \nThe single dose vial containing Xiapex and the single dose vial containing the solvent for solution for \ninjection for reconstitution must be refrigerated. \n \n1. Before use, remove the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Xiapex and the vial containing \n\nthe diluent for reconstitution from the refrigerator and allow the two vials to stand at room \ntemperature for at least 15 minutes and no longer than 60 minutes. Visually inspect the vial \ncontaining Xiapex. The cake of lyophilized powder should be intact and white in colour. \n\n \n2. Confirm the joint to be treated (metacarpophalangeal [MP] or proximal interphalangeal [PIP]) \n\nas the volume of solvent required for reconstitution is determined by the type of joint (PIP joint \nrequires a smaller volume for injection). \n\n \n3. After removal of the flip-off cap from each vial, using aseptic technique swab the rubber stopper \n\nand surrounding surface of the vial containing Xiapex and the vial containing the diluent for \nreconstitution with sterile alcohol (no other antiseptics should be used). \n\n \n4. Use only the supplied diluent for reconstitution. The diluent contains calcium which is required \n\nfor the activity of Xiapex. \n \n5. Using a 1 ml syringe with 0.01 ml graduations with a 27-gauge 12-13 mm needle (not supplied), \n\nwithdraw the correct volume of the diluent supplied: \n \n\n• 0.39 ml of solvent for cords affecting a MP joint in Dupuytren’s contracture \n• 0.31 ml of solvent for cords affecting a PIP joint in Dupuytren’s contracture \n\n \n6. Inject the diluent slowly into the sides of the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Xiapex. \n\nDo not invert the vial or shake the solution. Slowly swirl the solution to ensure that all of the \nlyophilized powder has gone into solution. \n\n \n7. The reconstituted Xiapex solution can be kept at room temperature (20º to 25ºC) for up to one \n\nhour or refrigerated at 2º to 8°C for up to 4 hours prior to administration. If the reconstituted \nXiapex solution is refrigerated, allow this solution to return to room temperature for \napproximately 15 minutes before use. \n\n \n8. Discard the syringe and needle used for reconstitution and the diluent vial. \n \n9. When administering two injections in the same hand during a treatment visit, use a new syringe \n\nand separate vial of reconstituted solution (containing 0.58 mg of Xiapex) for the second \ninjection. Repeat steps 1 through 8. \n\n \n2. Identification of treatment area \n \n1. Prior to each treatment cycle, identify the treatment area as follows:  \n\nConfirm the joint to be treated (metacarpophalangeal [MP] or proximal interphalangeal [PIP]) \nas the volume of solvent required for reconstitution is determined by the type of joint (PIP joint \nrequires a smaller volume for injection). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n48 \n\n3. Injection procedure \n \nAdministration of a local anaesthetic medicinal product prior to injection of Xiapex is not \nrecommended, as it may interfere with proper placement of the injection. \n \n1. The reconstituted Xiapex solution should be clear. Inspect the solution visually for particulate \n\nmatter and discolouration prior to administration. If the solution contains particulates, is cloudy, \nor is discoloured, do not inject the reconstituted solution.  \n \n\n2. Reconfirm the cord to be injected. The site chosen for injection must be the area where the \ncontracting cord is maximally separated from the underlying flexor tendons and where the skin \nis not intimately adhered to the cord. \n\n \n3. When administering two injections in the same hand during a treatment visit, begin with the \n\naffected finger in the most ulnar aspect of the hand and continue toward the radial aspect \n(eg, fifth finger to index finger). Within each finger, begin with the affected joint in the \nmost proximal aspect of the finger and continue toward the distal aspect (eg, MP to PIP). \nFor each injection, follow steps 4-10. \n\n \n4. Apply antiseptic at the site of the injection and allow the skin to dry. \n \n5. Using a new sterile, hubless syringe with 0.01 ml graduations and a permanently fixed, 26 or \n\n27 gauge, 12 or 13 mm needle (not supplied), withdraw the adequate volume of reconstituted \nsolution for a 0.58 mg dose of Xiapex required for injection to deliver: \n• 0.25 ml of reconstituted Xiapex for cords affecting a MP joint or \n• 0.20 ml of reconstituted Xiapex for cords affecting a PIP joint. \n\n \n6. Use caution with cords as they approach the PIP flexion crease area. If injecting into a cord \n\naffecting the PIP joint of the fifth (little) finger, care must be taken to inject as close to the \npalmar digital crease as possible and not to insert more than 2 mm to 3 mm in depth. For PIP \njoints do not inject more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease. \n\n \n7. With your non-dominant hand, secure the patient’s hand to be treated while simultaneously \n\napplying tension to the cord. With your dominant hand, place the needle into the cord, using \ncaution to keep the needle within the cord. Avoid having the needle tip pass completely through \nthe cord to help minimise the potential for injection of Xiapex into tissues other than the cord. \nAfter needle placement, if there is any concern that the needle is in the flexor tendon, apply a \nsmall amount of passive motion at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. If insertion of the \nneedle into a tendon is suspected or paresthesia is noted by the patient, withdraw the needle and \nreposition it into the cord. If the needle is in the proper location, there will be some resistance \nnoted during the injection procedure. See Figure 1 below for an illustration of the injection \ntechnique. \n\n \n8. After confirming that the needle is correctly placed in the cord, inject approximately one-third \n\nof the dose. \n \n9. Next, keeping the needle under the skin at all times, withdraw the needle tip from the cord and \n\nreposition it in a slightly more distal location (approximately 2-3 mm) to the initial injection in \nthe cord and inject another one-third of the dose. \n\n \n10. Again keeping the needle under the skin at all times, withdraw the needle tip from the cord and \n\nreposition it a third time proximal to the initial injection (approximately 2-3 mm) and inject the \nfinal portion of the dose into the cord (see Figure 2). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n49 \n\nThe figures 1 and 2 below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be representative of the \nprecise location of anatomical structures in an individual patient. \n \nFigure 1: Illustration of the injection technique. \n \n\n \n \n \nFigure 2: Three step injection of Xiapex into the cord. \n \n\n \n \n11. Wrap the patient’s treated hand with a soft, bulky, gauze dressing. \n \n12. Discard the unused portion of the reconstituted solution and solvent after injection. Do not store, \n\npool, or use any vials containing unused reconstituted solution or solvent. \n \n13. Patients should be instructed: \n\n• Not to flex or extend the fingers of the injected hand to reduce extravasation of Xiapex \nout of the cord until the finger extension procedure is completed. \n\n• Not attempt to disrupt the injected cord by self manipulation at any time. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n50 \n\n• To elevate the injected hand as much as possible until the day after the finger extension \nprocedure. \n\n• To promptly contact their doctor if there is evidence of infection (e.g., fever, chills, \nincreasing redness or oedema) or trouble bending the finger after the swelling goes down \n(symptoms of tendon rupture). \n\n• To return to see their physician approximately 24-72 hours after each injection for an \nexamination of the injected hand and a possible finger extension procedure to disrupt the \ncord. \n\n \n4. Finger extension procedure \n \n1. At the follow-up visit approximately 24-72 hours after injection, determine if the contracture \n\nhas resolved. If a cord contracture remains, a passive finger extension procedure will be \nperformed in an attempt to disrupt the cord. \n \n\n2. If cords of two affected joints in one finger were treated, perform the finger extension \nprocedure on the cord affecting the MP joint before performing the procedure on the cord \naffecting the PIP joint. \n\n \n3.  Local anaesthesia may be used, if needed, during the finger extension procedure. \n \n4. While the patient’s wrist is in the flexed position, apply moderate stretching pressure to the \n\ninjected cord by extending the finger for approximately 10 to 20 seconds. For cords affecting \nthe PIP joint, perform the finger extension procedure when the MP joint is in the flexed \nposition. \n\n \n5. If the first finger extension procedure does not result in disruption of the cord, a second and \n\nthird attempt can be performed at 5- to 10-minute intervals. No more than 3 attempts per \naffected joint are recommended to disrupt a cord. \n\n \n6. If the cord has not disrupted after 3 attempts of extension per cord, a follow-up visit may be \n\nscheduled approximately 4 weeks after the injection. If, at that subsequent visit the contracted \ncord persists, an additional injection and finger extension procedure may be performed. \n\n \n7. Following the finger extension procedure(s) and fitting patient with a splint (with treated joint in \n\nmaximum extension), patients should be instructed to: \n• Not perform strenuous activity with the injected hand until advised to do so. \n• Wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months. \n• Perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises several times a day for several \n\nmonths. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n51 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe following information is intended for Peyronie’s disease patients only: \n\nInstructions on how to gently stretch your penis \n\nGently stretch your penis 3 times a day.

Preparation - Reconstitution procedure \n \nThe single dose vial containing Xiapex and the single dose vial containing the solvent for solution for \ninjection for reconstitution must be refrigerated. \n \na) Before use, remove the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Xiapex and the vial containing \n\nthe diluent for reconstitution from the refrigerator and allow the two vials to stand at room \ntemperature for at least 15 minutes and no longer than 60 minutes. Visually inspect the vial \ncontaining Xiapex. The cake of lyophilized powder should be intact and white in colour. \n \n\nb) After removal of the flip-off cap from each vial, using aseptic technique swab the rubber stopper \nand surrounding surface of the vial containing Xiapex and the vial containing the diluent for \nreconstitution with sterile alcohol (no other antiseptics should be used).  \n \n\nc) Use only the supplied diluent for reconstitution. The diluent contains calcium which is required \nfor the activity of Xiapex.  \n \n\nd) Using a 1 ml syringe with 0.01 ml graduations with a 27-gauge 12-13 mm needle (not supplied), \nwithdraw the correct volume of the diluent supplied: \n\n \n• 0.39 ml of solvent for the penile plaque in Peyronie’s disease \n \n\ne) Inject the diluent slowly into the sides of the vial containing the lyophilized powder of Xiapex. \nDo not invert the vial or shake the solution. Slowly swirl the solution to ensure that all of the \nlyophilized powder has gone into solution. \n\n \nf) The reconstituted Xiapex solution can be kept at room temperature (20º to 25ºC) for up to one \n\nhour or refrigerated at 2º to 8°C for up to 4 hours prior to administration. If the reconstituted \nXiapex solution is refrigerated, allow this solution to return to room temperature for \napproximately 15 minutes before use. \n\n \ng) Discard the syringe and needle used for reconstitution and the diluent vial. \n \n2. Identification of treatment area \n \na) Prior to each treatment cycle, identify the treatment area as follows: \n\n• Induce a penile erection  \n• Locate the plaque at the point of maximum concavity (or focal point) in the bend of the \n\npenis \n• Mark the point with a surgical marker. This indicates the target area in the plaque for \n\nXiapex deposition \n \n3. Injection procedure \n \na) The reconstituted Xiapex solution should be clear. Inspect the solution visually for particulate \n\nmatter and discolouration prior to administration. If the solution contains particulates, is cloudy, \nor is discoloured, do not inject the reconstituted solution. \n \n\nb) Apply antiseptic at the site of the injection and allow the skin to dry. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n53 \n\nc) Administer suitable local anaesthetic, if desired. \n \n\nd) Using a new hubless syringe containing 0.01 ml graduations with a permanently fixed 27-gauge \n12 or 13 mm needle (not supplied), withdraw a volume of 0.25 ml of reconstituted solution \n(containing 0.58 mg of Xiapex). \n\n \ne) The penis should be in a flaccid state before Xiapex is injected. Place the needle tip on the side \n\nof the target plaque in alignment with the point of maximal concavity. Orient the needle so that \nit enters the plaque from the side, NOT downwards or perpendicularly towards the corpora \ncavernosum. \n\n \nf) Insert and advance the needle transversely through the width of the plaque, towards the opposite \n\nside of the plaque without passing completely through it. Proper needle position is tested and \nconfirmed by carefully noting resistance to minimal depression of the syringe plunger. \n\n \ng) With the tip of the needle placed within the plaque, initiate injection, maintaining steady \n\npressure to slowly inject the drug into the plaque. Withdraw the needle slowly so as to deposit \nthe full dose along the needle track within the plaque. For plaques that are only a few \nmillimetres in width, the distance of withdrawal of the syringe may be very minimal. The goal \nis always to deposit the full dose entirely within the plaque. \n\n \nh) Upon complete withdrawal of the needle, apply gentle pressure at the injection site. Apply a \n\ndressing as necessary. \n \ni) Discard the unused portion of the reconstituted solution and diluent after each injection. Do not \n\nstore, pool, or use any vials containing unused reconstituted solution or diluent. \n \nj) The second injection of each treatment cycle should be made approximately 2 to 3 mm apart \n\nfrom the first injection. \n \n4. Penile modelling procedure \n \nPenile modelling helps relieve curvature deformity and straighten the penile shaft. At a follow-up visit \n1 to 3 days after the second injection of each treatment cycle, perform a penile modelling procedure \n(as described below) on the flaccid penis to stretch and elongate the plaque that Xiapex has disrupted: \n\n• Administer suitable local anaesthetic, if desired. \n• Wearing gloves, grasp the plaque or indurated portion of the flaccid penis about 1 cm \n\nproximal and distal to the injection site. Avoid direct pressure on the injection site. \n• Using the target plaque as a fulcrum point, use both hands to apply firm, steady pressure \n\nto elongate and stretch the plaque. The goal is to gradually create bending opposite to the \npatient’s penile curvature, with stretching to the point of moderate resistance. Hold \npressure for 30 seconds then release. \n\n• After a 30 second rest period, repeat the penile modelling technique for a total of 3 \nmodelling attempts at 30 seconds for each attempt. \n\n \nThe patient should then be instructed to self-perform penile modelling activities at home each day for \nthe 6-week period following the physician penile plaque modelling visit of each treatment cycle, \naccording to the detailed instructions provided in the package leaflet. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX IV \n \n\nSCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS \nOF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) \n\n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n55 \n\nScientific conclusions \n \nTaking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for collagenase clostridium \nhistolyticum, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: \n \nThe review of data presented in the PSUR for Xiapex, covering the period from 28 February 2018 to \n27 February 2019, identified post-marketing and literature case reports of finger necrosis and/or \namputation and of finger fractures in patients with Dupuytren’s contracture treated with collagenase \nclostridium histolyticum. Taking into account the plausibility of the mechanism of collagenase \nclostridium histolyticum and the subsequent manipulation procedure in patients with Dupuytren’s \ncontracture, the PRAC considers that the product information for Xiapex should be updated to \ninclude a warning with regards to finger necrosis resulting in some cases in finger amputation and a \nwarning with regards to finger fracture should be included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Reduced \nperipheral circulation may be one contributing factor for finger necrosis. For patients with an \nincreased risk of fracture, e.g. patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis, special caution is needed during \nthe manipulation procedure. The section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to include the adverse reactions \n“digital necrosis” and “digital fracture” with a frequency “not known”. The package leaflet is \nupdated accordingly. \n\nIn addition, based on the review of post marketing case reports of penile fracture in patients with \nPeyronie’s disease, the PRAC considers that the product information for Xiapex should be updated to \ninclude a new wording for section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PIL to increase the minimum \ntime span between injection and resumption of sexual activity to at least 4 weeks and to be cautious \nwhen resuming sexual activity. \n\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for collagenase clostridium histolyticum the CHMP is of the \nopinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing collagenase clostridium \nhistolyticum is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied. \n \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
