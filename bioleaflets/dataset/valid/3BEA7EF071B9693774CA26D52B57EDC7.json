NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nAptivus 250 mg soft capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach soft capsule contains 250 mg tipranavir. \n\nExcipients with known effect: Each soft capsule contains \n100.0 mg ethanol, 455.0 mg macrogolglycerol ricinoleate and 12.6 mg sorbitol\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSoft capsule.\n\nPink, oblong soft gelatin capsules imprinted with \u201cTPV 250\u201d in black.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment \nof HIV-1 infection in highly pre-treated adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with virus \nresistant to multiple protease inhibitors. Aptivus should only be used as part of an active combination \nantiretroviral regimen in patients with no other therapeutic options.\n\nIn deciding to initiate treatment with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful \nconsideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of \nmutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and \ntreatment history should guide the use of Aptivus. Initiation of treatment should take into account the \ncombinations of mutations which may negatively impact the virological response to Aptivus, co-\nadministered with low dose ritonavir (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nAptivus must always be given with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, and in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of \nritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Aptivus (especially as regards \nthe contraindications, warnings and undesirable effects sections).\n\nAptivus should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. \n\nPosology\nAdults and adolescents (from 12 \u2013 18 years of age)\nThe recommended dose of Aptivus is 500 mg, co-administered with 200 mg ritonavir (low dose \nritonavir), twice daily (see section 4.4 for precautionary measures in adolescents).\n\nDoses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy \nprofile of the combination.\nSince currently only limited efficacy and safety data are available for adolescents (see section 5.1) \nclose monitoring of virologic response and tolerance is particularly warranted in this patient group.\n\n\n\n3\n\nMissed dose\nPatients should be advised of the need to take Aptivus and ritonavir every day as prescribed. If a dose \nis missed by more than 5 hours, the patient should be instructed to wait and then to take the next dose \nof Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If a dose is missed by less than 5 hours, the \npatient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, and then to take the next dose of \nAptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time.\n\nElderly\nClinical studies of Aptivus did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to \ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger subjects (see section 5.2).\nIn general, caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of Aptivus in older \npeople reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of \nconcomitant disease or other therapy (see section 4.4).\n\nLiver impairment\nTipranavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. Liver impairment could therefore result in an increase \nof tipranavir exposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, Aptivus should be used with \ncaution, and with increased monitoring frequency, in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh Class A). Aptivus is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or \nC) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Aptivus capsules in children aged 2 to 12 years has not been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can \nbe made.\n\nAlso, appropriate dose adjustments for children under 12 years cannot be achieved with Aptivus \ncapsules. Aptivus oral solution is available for children between 2 and 12 years of age (please refer to \nthe respective SmPC for further details).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Aptivus in children under 2 years of age has not been established. No data \nare available. \n\nMethod of administration \nOral use.\nAptivus soft capsules co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be taken with food (see section \n5.2).\nAptivus soft capsules must be swallowed whole and must not be opened or chewed.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment. \n\nCombination of rifampicin with Aptivus with concomitant low dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nHerbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased \nplasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of tipranavir (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of Aptivus with low dose ritonavir, with active substances that are highly dependent \non CYP3A for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious \nand/or life-threatening events. These active substances include antiarrhythmics (such as amiodarone, \n\n\n\n4\n\nbepridil, quinidine), antihistamines (such as astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (such as \ndihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (such \nas cisapride), antipsychotics (such as pimozide, sertindole, quetiapine, lurasidone), sedatives/hypnotics \n(such as orally administered midazolam and triazolam) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as \nsimvastatin and lovastatin) (see section 4.5). Also the use of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist \nalfuzosin, and sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, \nco-administration of Aptivus with low dose ritonavir, and medicinal products that are highly \ndependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and \nmetoprolol given in heart failure (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of colchicine with Aptivus/ritonavir in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAptivus must be administered with low dose ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect (see section 4.2). \nFailure to correctly co-administer tipranavir with ritonavir will result in reduced plasma levels of \ntipranavir that may be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Patients should be instructed \naccordingly. \n\nAptivus is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Patients receiving Aptivus or any other \nantiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV-1 infection.\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n\nSwitching from Aptivus capsules to the oral solution\nAptivus capsules are not interchangeable with the oral solution. Compared to the capsules, tipranavir \nexposure is higher when administering the same dose as oral solution. Also, the composition of the \noral solution is different from that of the capsules, with the high vitamin E content being especially \nnoteworthy. Both of these factors may contribute to an increased risk of adverse reactions (type, \nfrequency and/or severity). Therefore patients should not be switched from Aptivus capsules to \nAptivus oral solution (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\nSwitching from Aptivus oral solution to the capsules\nAptivus oral solution is not interchangeable with the capsules. Compared to the oral solution, \ntipranavir exposure is lower when administering the same dose as capsules. However, children \npreviously treated with Aptivus oral solution and becoming 12 years of age should be switched to \ncapsules, particularly because of the more favourable safety profile of the capsules. It has to be noted \nthat the switch from the oral solution to the capsule formulation of Aptivus could be associated with \ndecreased exposure. Therefore, it is recommended that patients switching from Aptivus oral solution \nto capsules at the age of 12 years are closely monitored for the virologic response of their \nantiretroviral regimen (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\nLiver disease\nAptivus is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C) hepatic \ninsufficiency. Limited data are currently available for the use of Aptivus, co-administered with low \ndose ritonavir, in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and \ntreated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal \nhepatic adverse reaction. Aptivus should be used in this patient population only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk, and with increased clinical and laboratory monitoring. In the case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) should be closely monitored.\n\n\n\n5\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice. Aptivus with ritonavir should be discontinued once signs of worsening \nliver function occur in patients with pre-existing liver disease.\n\nAptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, has been associated with reports of clinical hepatitis \nand hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients with \nadvanced HIV disease taking multiple concomitant medicinal products. Caution should be exercised \nwhen administering Aptivus to patients with liver enzyme abnormalities or with a history of hepatitis. \nIncreased ALAT/ASAT monitoring should be considered in these patients.\n\nAptivus therapy should not be initiated in patients with pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT greater than 5 \ntimes the Upper Limit Normal (ULN) until baseline ASAT/ALAT is stabilised at less than 5X ULN, \nunless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.\n\nAptivus therapy should be discontinued in patients experiencing ASAT or ALAT elevations greater \nthan 10X ULN, or developing signs or symptoms of clinical hepatitis during therapy. If another cause \nis identified (eg acute hepatitis A, B or C virus, gallbladder disease, other medicinal products), then \nrechallenge with Aptivus may be considered when ASAT/ALAT have returned to the patient\u2019s \nbaseline levels.\n\nLiver monitoring\nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done prior to initiation of therapy, after two, four and then every \nfour weeks until 24 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter. Increased monitoring (i.e. \nprior to initiation of therapy, every two weeks during the first three months of treatment, then monthly \nuntil 48 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter) is warranted when Aptivus and low \ndose ritonavir are administered to patients with elevated ASAT and ALAT levels, mild hepatic \nimpairment, chronic hepatitis B or C, or other underlying liver disease.\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve patients\nIn a study performed in antiretroviral na\u00efve adult patients, tipranavir 500 mg with ritonavir 200 mg \ntwice daily, as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, was associated with an excess in the occurrence of \nsignificant (grade 3 and 4) transaminase elevations without any advantage in terms of efficacy (trend \ntowards a lower efficacy). The study was prematurely stopped after 60 weeks.\nTherefore, tipranavir with ritonavir should not be used in treatment-na\u00efve patients (see section 4.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nSince the renal clearance of tipranavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are not expected \nin patients with renal impairment.\n\nHaemophilia\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some \npatients additional Factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n\nBleeding\nRESIST participants receiving Aptivus with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at \n24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to \n1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between \ntreatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further \nmonitored.\n\n\n\n6\n\nFatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhages (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving Aptivus, \nmany of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that \nmay have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of Aptivus cannot be \nexcluded. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in \npatients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of \ncoagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on Aptivus.\n\nAn increased risk of ICH has previously been observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS \nsuch as those treated in the Aptivus clinical trials.\n\nIn in vitro experiments, tipranavir was observed to inhibit human platelet aggregation at levels \nconsistent with exposures observed in patients receiving Aptivus with ritonavir.\n\nIn rats, co-administration with vitamin E increased the bleeding effects of tipranavir (see section 5.3).\n\nAptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who may be \nat risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving \nmedicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and \nanticoagulants or who are taking supplemental vitamin E. Based on the limits of exposure available \nfrom observation in clinical trials, it is recommended not to co-administer to patients more than \n1,200 IU vitamin E per day.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. A higher increase of blood lipids were seen with tipranavir/ritonavir \nthan with comparators (other protease inhibitors) in clinical trials. For monitoring of blood lipids and \nglucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed \nas clinically appropriate. \n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumocystis pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted \nwhen necessary. In addition, reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in \nclinical studies with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nRash\nMild to moderate rashes including urticarial rash, maculopapular rash, and photosensitivity have been \nreported in subjects receiving Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir. At 48-weeks in Phase \nIII trials, rash of various types was observed in 15.5% males and 20.5% females receiving Aptivus co-\nadministered with low dose ritonavir. Additionally, in one interaction trial, in healthy female \nvolunteers administered a single dose of ethinyl oestradiol followed by Aptivus co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir, 33% of subjects developed a rash. Rash accompanied by joint pain or stiffness, \nthroat tightness, or generalized pruritus has been reported in both men and women receiving Aptivus\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir. In the paediatric clinical trial, the frequency of rash (all \ngrades, all causality) through 48 weeks of treatment was higher than in adult patients.\n\n\n\n7\n\nOsteonecrosis\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nInteractions\nThe interaction profile of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex. The \nmechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile of tipranavir are \ndescribed (see section 4.5).\n\nAbacavir and zidovudine \nThe concomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with zidovudine or \nabacavir, results in a significant decrease in plasma concentration of these nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Therefore, the concomitant use of zidovudine or abacavir with \nAptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not-recommended unless there are no other \navailable NRTIs suitable for patient management (see section 4.5).\n\nProtease inhibitors\nConcomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with the protease inhibitors \namprenavir, lopinavir or saquinavir (each co-administered with low dose ritonavir) in a dual-boosted \nregimen, results in significant decreases in plasma concentrations of these protease inhibitors. A \nsignificant decrease in plasma concentrations of atazanavir and a marked increase of tipranavir and \nritonavir concentrations was observed when Aptivus, associated with low dose ritonavir, was co-\nadministered with atazanavir (see section 4.5). No data are currently available on interactions of \ntipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with protease inhibitors other than those listed \nabove. Therefore, the co-administration of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with \nprotease inhibitors is not recommended.\n\nOral contraceptives and oestrogens \nSince levels of ethinyl oestradiol are decreased, the co-administration of Aptivus co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir is not recommended. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures are to be \nused when oestrogen based oral contraceptives are co-administered with Aptivus co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir (see section 4.5). Patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should \nbe clinically monitored for signs of oestrogen deficiency. Women using oestrogens may have an \nincreased risk of non serious rash.\n\nAnticonvulsants\nCaution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Aptivus may \nbe less effective due to decreased tipranavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents \nconcomitantly (see section 4.5).\n\nHalofantrine, lumefantrine\nDue to their metabolic profile and inherent risk of inducing torsades de pointes, administration of \nhalofantrine and lumefantrine with Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\nDisulfiram/metronidazole\nAptivus soft capsules contain alcohol (7% ethanol, ie 100 mg per capsule or up to 200 mg per dose) \nwhich can produce disulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram or other medicinal \nproducts which produce this reaction (e.g. metronidazole).\n\nFluticasone\nConcomitant use of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and fluticasone or other \nglucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of \n\n\n\n8\n\ntreatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and \nadrenal suppression (see section 4.5).\n\nAtorvastatin\nTipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, increases the plasma concentrations of \natorvastatin (see section 4.5). The combination is not recommended. Other HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitors should be considered such as pravastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). \nHowever, if atorvastatin is specifically required for patient management, it should be started with the \nlowest dose and careful monitoring is necessary.\n\nOmeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors\nThe combined use of Aptivus with ritonavir with either omeprazole, esomeprazole or with other \nproton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n\nColchicine \nIn patients with normal renal and hepatic function, a reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption \nof colchicine treatment is recommended in co-administration (see section 4.5).\n\nSalmeterol\nConcomitant use of salmeterol and Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\nBosentan\nDue to the marked hepatotoxicity of bosentan and the potential for increasing the liver toxicity \nassociated with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, this combination is not \nrecommended.\n\nWarnings related to certain excipients\nAptivus contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.\n\nThis medicine contains 100 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each capsule. The amount in 250 mg of this \nmedicine (i.e. one capsule) is equivalent to less than 3 ml of beer, or than 1 ml of wine.\nThe small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe interaction profile of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex and requires \nspecial attention in particular in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nMetabolic profile of tipranavir\nTipranavir is a substrate, an inducer and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A. When co-\nadministered with ritonavir at the recommended dosage (see section 4.2) there is a net inhibition of \nP450 CYP3A. Co-administration of Aptivus and low dose ritonavir with agents primarily metabolised \nby CYP3A may result in changed plasma concentrations of tipranavir or the other agents, which could \nalter their therapeutic and undesirable effects (see list and details of considered agents, below). Agents \nthat are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for \nserious adverse reactions are detailed in this section, and listed in section 4.3.\n\nA cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500 mg tipranavir with \n200 mg ritonavir  capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic \nCYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 \n(midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (digoxin). At steady state, there was a significant induction of \nCYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and \nintestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. P-gp activity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, \n\n\n\n9\n\nbut there was a slight induction at steady state. Practical recommendations deriving from this study are \ndisplayed below.\n\nStudies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP \n2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, \nbecause ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor. The in vivo net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on \nCYP 1A2, CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19, indicates, through a preliminary study, an inducing potential of \ntipranavir with ritonavir on CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, on CYP2C9 and P-gp after several days of \ntreatment. Data are not available to indicate whether tipranavir inhibits or induces glucuronosyl \ntransferases. \n\nIn vitro studies show that tipranavir is a substrate and also an inhibitor of P-gp. \n\nIt is difficult to predict the net effect of Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir on oral\nbioavailability and plasma concentrations of agents that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. The \nnet effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co-administered substance for CYP3A and \nP-gp, and the extent of intestinal first-pass metabolism/efflux.\n\nCo-administration of Aptivus and agents that induce CYP3A and/or P-gp may decrease tipranavir \nconcentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect (see list and details of considered agents, below). Co-\nadministration of Aptivus and medicinal products that inhibit P-gp may increase tipranavir plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in the table below.\n\nInteraction table\nInteractions between Aptivus and co-administered medicinal products are listed in the table below \n(increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, once daily as \u201cQD\u201d, twice daily as \n\u201cBID\u201d, concentration at end of dosing interval as \u201cC\u03c4\u201d).\nUnless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of \nAptivus/r (i.e. 500/200 mg BID). However, some PK interaction studies were not performed with this \nrecommended dosage. Nevertheless, the results of many of these interaction studies can be \nextrapolated to the recommended dosage since the doses used (eg. TPV/r 500/100 mg, TPV/r \n750/200 mg) represented extremes of hepatic enzyme induction and inhibition and bracketed the \nrecommended dosage of Aptivus/r.\n\nDrugs by therapeutic area Interaction\nGeometric mean change (%)\n\nRecommendations concerning\nco-administration\n\nAnti-infectives\nAntiretrovirals\nNucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)\nSince there is no significant impact of nucleoside and nucleotide analogues on the P450 enzyme system no \ndosage adjustment of Aptivus is required when co-administered with these agents.\n\nAbacavir 300 mg BID\n(TPV/r 750/100 mg BID)\n\nAbacavir Cmax \u2193 46%\nAbacavir AUC \u2193 36%\n\nThe clinical relevance of this \nreduction has not been \nestablished, but may decrease the \nefficacy of abacavir.\n\nMechanism unknown.\n\nThe concomitant use of Aptivus, co-\nadministered with low dose \nritonavir, with abacavir is not \nrecommended unless there are no \nother available NRTIs suitable for \npatient management.

Systemic corticosteroid \neffects including Cushing's \nsyndrome and adrenal suppression \nhave been reported in patients \nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or \nintranasally administered \nfluticasone propionate; this could \nalso occur with other corticosteroids \nmetabolised via the P450 3A \npathway e.g. budesonide. \nIt is unknown whether the \ncombination of tipranavir with \nritonavir might cause a larger \nincrease in fluticasone exposure.\n\nConcomitant administration of \nAptivus, co-administered with low \ndose ritonavir, and these \nglucocorticoids is not recommended \nunless the potential benefit of \ntreatment outweighs the risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid effects (see \nsection 4.4). A dose reduction of the \nglucocorticoid should be considered \nwith close monitoring of local and \nsystemic effects or a switch to a \nglucocorticoid, which is not a \nsubstrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone). Moreover, in case \nof withdrawal of glucocorticoids \nprogressive dose reduction may \nhave to be performed over a longer \nperiod. The effects of high \nfluticasone systemic exposure on \nritonavir plasma levels are as yet \nunknown.\n\n\n\n23\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nTipranavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, effective, safe \nmethod of contraception should be used during treatment (see section 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of tipranavir in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Tipranavir \nshould be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreastfeeding\nConsistent with the recommendation that HIV-infected mothers should not breast-feed their infants \nunder any circumstances to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV, mothers should discontinue \nbreast-feeding if they are receiving Aptivus.\n\nFertility\nClinical data on fertility are not available for tipranavir. Preclinical studies performed with tipranavir \nshowed no adverse effect on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness, somnolence, and fatigue have been reported in some patients; therefore, caution should be \nrecommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If patients experience fatigue, dizziness, or \nsomnolence they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nAmongst the most common adverse reactions reported for Aptivus were gastrointestinal complaints \nsuch as diarrhoea and nausea as well as hyperlipidaemia. The most serious adverse reactions include \nhepatic impairment and liver toxicity. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) was only observed in post \nmarketing experience (see section 4.4).\n\nAptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, has been associated with reports of significant liver \ntoxicity. In Phase III RESIST trials, the frequency of transaminase elevations was significantly \nincreased in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm compared to the comparator arm. Close monitoring is \ntherefore needed in patients treated with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir (see section \n4.4).\n\nLimited data are currently available for the use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, in \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Aptivus should therefore be used with caution in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis B or C. Aptivus should be used in this patient population only if the \npotential benefit outweighs the potential risk, and with increased clinical and laboratory monitoring.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nAssessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on experience in all Phase II \nand III trials in adults treated with the 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir dose twice daily \n(n=1397) and are listed below by system organ class and frequency according to the following \ncategories:\nVery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100), \nrare (\u22651/10,000 to \uf03c1/1,000) \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with Aptivus based on clinical studies and post-\nmarketing experience:\n\n\n\n24\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\nuncommon neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia\nImmune system disorders\n\nuncommon hypersensitivity\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\ncommon hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperlipidaemia\nuncommon anorexia, decreased appetite, weight decreased, \n\nhyperamylasaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia\n\nrare dehydration\n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nuncommon insomnia, sleep disorder\n\nNervous system disorders\n\ncommon headache\n\nuncommon dizziness, neuropathy peripheral, somnolence\n\nrare intracranial haemorrhage*\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\nuncommon dyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nvery common diarrhoea, nausea\n\ncommon vomiting, flatulence, abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, dyspepsia\n\nuncommon gastrooesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis\n\nrare lipase increased\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\n\nuncommon hepatic enzyme increased (ALAT, ASAT), \ncytolytic hepatitis, liver function test abnormal \n(ALAT, ASAT), hepatitis toxic\n\nrare hepatic failure (including fatal outcome), \nhepatitis, hepatic steatosis, hyperbilirubinaemia\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\ncommon rash\n\nuncommon pruritus, exanthem\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\nuncommon myalgia, muscle spasms\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nuncommon renal failure\n\n\n\n25\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\ncommon fatigue\n\nuncommon pyrexia, influenza like illness, malaise\n\n* see section Description of selected adverse reactions \u201cBleeding\u201d for source of information\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe following clinical safety features (hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidaemia, bleeding events, rash) were \nseen at higher frequency among tipranavir with ritonavir treated patients when compared with the \ncomparator arm treated patients in the RESIST trials, or have been observed with tipranavir with \nritonavir administration. The clinical significance of these observations has not been fully explored. \n\nHepatotoxicity\nAfter 48 weeks of follow-up, the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 ALAT and/or ASAT abnormalities was \nhigher in tipranavir with ritonavir patients compared with comparator arm patients (10% and 3.4%, \nrespectively). Multivariate analyses showed that baseline ALAT or ASAT above DAIDS Grade 1 and \nco-infection with hepatitis B or C were risk factors for these elevations. Most patients were able to \ncontinue treatment with tipranavir with ritonavir. \n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nHyperlipidaemia\nGrade 3 or 4 elevations of triglycerides occurred more frequently in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm \ncompared with the comparator arm. At 48 weeks these rates were 25.2% of patients in the tipranavir \nwith ritonavir arm and 15.6% in the comparator arm.  \n\nBleeding\nThis adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \nrandomised controlled clinical trials (n=6300).\nRESIST participants receiving tipranavir with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at \n24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to \n1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between \ntreatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further \nmonitored.\nFatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving tipranavir, \nmany of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that \nmay have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of tipranavir cannot \nbe excluded. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in \npatients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of \ncoagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on Aptivus.\nAn increased risk of ICH has previously been observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS \nsuch as those treated in the Aptivus clinical trials.\n\nRash\nAn interaction study in women between tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and \nethinyl oestradiol/norethindrone demonstrated a high frequency of non-serious rash. In the RESIST \ntrials, the risk of rash was similar between tipranavir with ritonavir and comparator arms (16.3% vs. \n12.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). No cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal \nNecrolysis have been reported in the clinical development programme of tipranavir.\n\n\n\n26\n\nLaboratory abnormalities\nFrequencies of marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in at least 2% of \npatients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arms in the phase III clinical studies (RESIST-1 and RESIST-\n2) after 48-weeks were increased ASAT (6.1%), increased ALAT (9.7%), increased amylase (6.0%), \nincreased cholesterol (4.2%), increased triglycerides (24.9%), and decreased white blood cell count \n(5.7%).\n\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with protease \ninhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). Reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes \nzoster virus infections were observed in the RESIST trials.\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn an open-label, dose-finding study of tipranavir plus ritonavir (Trial 1182.14), 28 children who were \n12 years of age or above received Aptivus capsules. In general, adverse reactions were similar to those \nseen in adults, with the exception of vomiting, rash and pyrexia, which were reported more frequently\nin children than in adults. The most frequently reported moderate or severe adverse reactions in the 48 \nweek analyses are noted below.\n\nMost frequently reported moderate or severe adverse reactions in paediatric patients aged 12 to \n18 years who took Aptivus capsules (reported in 2 or more children, Trial 1182.14, week 48 \nanalyses, Full Analysis Set).\n\nTotal patients treated (N) 28\nEvents [N(%)]\nVomiting/ retching 3 (10.7)\nNausea 2 (7.1)\nAbdominal pain1 2 (7.1)\nRash2 3 (10.7)\nInsomnia 2 (7.1)\nALAT increased 4 (14.3)\n1 Includes abdominal pain  (N=1) and dyspepsia (N=1).\n2 Rash consists of one or more of the preferred terms of rash, drug eruption, rash macular, rash papular, erythema, rash \n\nmaculo-papular, rash pruritic, and urticaria\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience with tipranavir overdose is very limited. No specific signs and symptoms of \noverdose are known. Generally, an increased frequency and higher severity of adverse reactions may \nresult from overdose.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27\n\nThere is no known antidote for tipranavir overdose. Treatment of overdose should consist of general \nsupportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient\u2019s clinical \nstatus. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed tipranavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric \nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed \nsubstance. Since tipranavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant \nremoval of this medicine.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE09\n\nMechanism of action\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) encodes an aspartyl protease that is essential for the \ncleavage and maturation of viral protein precursors. Tipranavir is a non-peptidic inhibitor of the HIV-1 \nprotease that inhibits viral replication by preventing the maturation of viral particles.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nTipranavir inhibits the replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1 and clinical isolates in acute models \nof T-cell infection, with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90) ranging from 0.03 to \n0.07 \u00b5M (18-42 ng/ml) and 0.07 to 0.18 \u00b5M (42-108 ng/ml), respectively. Tipranavir demonstrates \nantiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M non-clade B isolates (A, C, D, F, G, \nH, CRF01 AE, CRF02 AG, CRF12 BF). Group O and HIV-2 isolates have reduced susceptibility in \nvitro to tipranavir with EC50 values ranging from 0.164-1 \u00b5M and 0.233-0.522 \u00b5M, respectively. \nProtein binding studies have shown that the antiviral activity of tipranavir decreases on average 3.75-\nfold in conditions where human serum is present. \n\nResistance\nThe development of resistance to tipranavir in vitro is slow and complex. In one particular in vitro\nresistance experiment, an HIV-1 isolate that was 87-fold resistant to tipranavir was selected after 9 \nmonths, and contained 10 mutations in the protease: L10F, I13V, V32I, L33F, M36I, K45I, I54V/T, \nA71V, V82L, I84V as well as a mutation in the gag polyprotein CA/P2 cleavage site. Reverse genetic \nexperiments showed that the presence of 6 mutations in the protease (I13V, V32I, L33F, K45I, V82L, \nI84V) was required to confer > 10-fold resistance to tipranavir while the full 10-mutation genotype \nconferred 69-fold resistance to tipranavir. In vitro, there is an inverse correlation between the degree \nof resistance to tipranavir and the capacity of viruses to replicate. Recombinant viruses showing \u2265 3-\nfold resistance to tipranavir grow at less than 1% of the rate detected for wild type HIV-1 in the same \nconditions. Tipranavir resistant viruses which emerge in vitro from wild-type HIV-1 show decreased \nsusceptibility to the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and \nritonavir but remain sensitive to saquinavir. \n\nThrough a series of multiple stepwise regression analyses of baseline and on-treatment genotypes from \nall clinical studies, 16 amino acids have been associated with reduced tipranavir susceptibility and/or \nreduced 48-week viral load response: 10V, 13V, 20M/R/V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/M/V, \n58E, 69K, 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 84V. Clinical isolates that exhibited a \uf0b3 10-fold decrease in tipranavir \nsusceptibility harboured 8 or more tipranavir-associated mutations. In Phase II and III clinical trials, \n276 patients with on-treatment genotypes have demonstrated that the predominant emerging mutations \nwith tipranavir treatment are L33F/I/V, V82T/L and I84V. Combination of all three of these is usually \nrequired for reduced susceptibility. Mutations at position 82 occur via two pathways: one from pre-\nexisting mutation 82A selecting to 82T, the other from wild type 82V selecting to 82L.\n\nCross-resistance\nTipranavir maintains significant antiviral activity (< 4-fold resistance) against the majority of HIV-1 \nclinical isolates showing post-treatment decreased susceptibility to the currently approved protease \ninhibitors: amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir. Greater \n\n\n\n28\n\nthan 10-fold resistance to tipranavir is uncommon (< 2.5% of tested isolates) in viruses obtained from \nhighly treatment experienced patients who have received multiple peptidic protease inhibitors.\n\nECG evaluation\nThe effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a study in \nwhich 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: \ntipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and \nplacebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF \nchange was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% \nUpper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at therapeutic dose \nwith low dose of ritonavir did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.\n\nClinical pharmacodynamic data\nThis indication is based on the results of two phase III studies, performed in highly pre-treated adult \npatients (median number of 12 prior antiretroviral agents) with virus resistant to protease inhibitors \nand of one phase II study investigating pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Aptivus in mostly \ntreatment-experienced adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years.\n\nThe following clinical data is derived from analyses of 48-week data from ongoing studies (RESIST-1 \nand RESIST-2) measuring effects on plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. RESIST-1 and \nRESIST-2 are ongoing, randomised, open-label, multicentre studies in HIV-positive, triple-class \nexperienced patients, evaluating treatment with 500 mg tipranavir co-administered with low dose \nritonavir (200 mg; twice daily) plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) individually defined for \neach patient based on genotypic resistance testing and patient history. The comparator regimen \nincluded a ritonavir-boosted PI (also individually defined) plus an OBR. The ritonavir-boosted PI was \nchosen from among saquinavir, amprenavir, indinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir.  \n\nAll patients had received at least two PI-based antiretroviral regimens and were failing a PI-based \nregimen at the time of study entry. At least one primary protease gene mutation from among 30N, 46I, \n46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or 90M had to be present at baseline, with not more than \ntwo mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.\n\nAfter Week 8, patients in the comparator arm who met the protocol defined criteria of initial lack of \nvirologic response had the option of discontinuing treatment and switching over to tipranavir with \nritonavir in a separate roll-over study. \n\nThe 1483 patients included in the primary analysis had a median age of 43 years (range 17-80), were \n86% male, 75% white, 13% black and 1% Asian. In the tipranavir and comparator arms median \nbaseline CD4 cell counts were 158 and 166 cells/mm3, respectively, (ranges 1-1893 and 1-\n1184 cells/mm3); median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.79 and 4.80 log10 copies/ml, respectively \n(ranges 2.34-6.52 and 2.01-6.76 log10 copies/ml). \n\nPatients had prior exposure to a median of 6 NRTIs, 1 NNRTI, and 4 PIs. In both studies, a total of \n67% patient viruses were resistant and 22% were possibly resistant to the pre-selected comparator PIs. \nA total of 10% of patients had previously used enfuvirtide. Patients had baseline HIV-1 isolates with a \nmedian of 16 HIV-1 protease gene mutations, including a median of 3 primary protease gene \nmutations D30N, L33F/I, V46I/L, G48V, I50V, V82A/F/T/L, I84V, and L90M. With respect to \nmutations on codons 33, 82, 84 and 90 approximately 4% had no mutations, 24% had mutations at \ncodons 82 (less than 1% of patients had the mutation V82L) and 90, 18% had mutations at codons 84 \nand 90 and 53% had at least one key mutation at codon 90. One patient in the tipranavir arm had four \nmutations. In addition the majority of participants had mutations associated with both NRTI and \nNNRTI resistance. Baseline phenotypic susceptibility was evaluated in 454 baseline patient samples.  \nThere was an average decrease in susceptibility of 2-fold wild type (WT) for tipranavir, 12-fold WT \nfor amprenavir, 55-fold WT for atazanavir, 41-fold WT for indinavir, 87-fold WT for lopinavir, 41-\nfold WT for nelfinavir, 195-fold WT for ritonavir, and 20-fold WT for saquinavir.\n\n\n\n29\n\nCombined 48-week treatment response (composite endpoint defined as patients with a confirmed \n\uf0b31 log RNA drop from baseline and without evidence of treatment failure) for both studies was 34% \nin the tipranavir with ritonavir arm and 15% in the comparator arm. Treatment response is presented \nfor the overall population (displayed by enfuvirtide use), and detailed by PI strata for the subgroup of \npatients with genotypically resistant strains in the Table below. \n\nTreatment response* at week 48 (pooled studies RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 in treatment-\nexperienced patients)\n\nRESIST study Tipranavir/RTV CPI/RTV** p-value\n\nn (%) N n (%) N\nOverall population\nFAS\nPP\n\n255 (34.2)\n171 (37.7)\n\n746\n454\n\n114 (15.5)\n74 (17.1)\n\n737\n432\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n\uf03c0.0001\n\n- with ENF (FAS) 85 (50.0) 170 28 (20.7) 135 \uf03c0.0001\n- without ENF (FAS) 170 (29.5) 576 86 (14.3) 602 \uf03c0.0001\n\nGenotypically Resistant\nLPV/rtv  \nFAS\nPP\n\n66 (28.9)\n47 (32.2)\n\n228\n146\n\n23 (9.5)\n13 (9.1)\n\n242\n143\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n\uf03c0.0001\n\nAPV/rtv\nFAS\nPP\n\n50 (33.3)\n38 (39.2)\n\n150\n97\n\n22 (14.9)\n17 (18.3)\n\n148\n93\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n0.0010\n\nSQV/rtv\nFAS\nPP\n\n22 (30.6)\n11 (28.2)\n\n72\n39\n\n5 (7.0)\n2 (5.7)\n\n71\n35\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n0.0650\n\nIDV/rtv\nFAS\nPP\n\n6 (46.2)\n3 (50.0)\n\n13\n6\n\n1 (5.3)\n1 (7.1)\n\n19\n14\n\n0.0026\n0.0650\n\n* Composite endpoint defined as patients with a confirmed 1 log RNA drop from baseline and without \nevidence of treatment failure \n** Comparator PI/RTV: LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg twice daily (n=358), IDV/r 800 mg/100 mg twice \ndaily (n=23), SQV/r 1000 mg/100 mg twice daily or 800 mg/200 mg twice daily (n=162), APV/r \n600 mg/100 mg twice daily (n=194)\nENF Enfuvirtide; FAS Full Analysis Set; PP Per Protocol; APV/rtv Amprenavir/ritonavir; IDV/rtv\nIndinavir/ritonavir; LPV/rtv Lopinavir/ritonavir; SQV/rtv Saquinavir/ritonavir\n\nCombined 48-week median time to treatment failure for both studies was 115 days in the tipranavir \nwith ritonavir arm and 0 days in the comparator arm (no treatment response was imputed to day 0).\n\nThrough 48 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm \ncompared to the comparator PI/ritonavir arm with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml was 30% and 14% \nrespectively, and with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml was 23% and 10% respectively. Among all \nrandomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the last \nmeasurement up to Week 48 was -0.64 log10 copies/ml in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir \nversus -0.22 log10 copies/ml in the comparator PI/ritonavir arm.\n\nAmong all randomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at \nthe last measurement up to Week 48 was +23 cells/mm3 in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir \n(N=740) versus +4 cells/mm3 in the comparator PI/ritonavir (N=727) arm.\n\nThe superiority of tipranavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir over the comparator protease \ninhibitor/ritonavir arm was observed for all efficacy parameters at week 48. It has not been shown that \ntipranavir is superior to these boosted comparator protease inhibitors in patients harbouring strains \nsusceptible to these protease inhibitors. RESIST data also demonstrate that tipranavir co-administered \n\n\n\n30\n\nwith low dose ritonavir exhibits a better treatment response at 48 weeks when the OBR contains \ngenotypically available antiretroviral agents (e.g. enfuvirtide).\n\nAt present there are no results from controlled trials evaluating the effect of tipranavir on clinical \nprogression of HIV.\n\nPaediatric population\nHIV-positive, paediatric patients, aged 2 through 18 years, were studied in a randomized, open-label, \nmulticenter study (trial 1182.14). Patients were required to have a baseline HIV-1 RNA concentration \nof at least 1500 copies/ml, were stratified by age (2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years and 12 to 18 years) \nand randomized to receive one of two tipranavir with ritonavir dose regimens: 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2\n\ndose, compared to the 290 mg/m2/115 mg/m2 dose, plus background therapy of at least two non-\nprotease inhibitor antiretroviral medicinal products, optimized using baseline genotypic resistance \ntesting. All patients initially received Aptivus oral solution. Paediatric patients who were 12 years or \nolder and received the maximum dose of 500 mg/200 mg twice daily could change to Aptivus capsules \nfrom study day 28. The trial evaluated pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, as well as virologic \nand immunologic responses through 48 weeks.  \n\nNo data are available on the efficacy and safety of Aptivus capsules in children less than 12 years of \nage. Since Aptivus capsules and oral solution are not bioequivalent, results obtained with the oral \nsolution cannot be extrapolated to the capsules (see also section 5.2). In patients with a body surface \narea of less than 1.33 m2 appropriate dose adjustments cannot be achieved with the capsule \nformulation.\n\nThe baseline characteristics and the key efficacy results at 48 weeks for the paediatric patients \nreceiving Aptivus capsules are displayed in the tables below. Data on the 29 patients who switched to \ncapsules during the first 48 weeks are presented. Due to limitations in the study design (e.g. non-\nrandomized switch allowed according to patient/clinician decision), any comparisons between patients \ntaking capsules and oral solution are not meaningful.\n\nBaseline characteristics for patients 12 \u2013 18 years of age who took capsule\n\nVariable Value\nNumber of Patients 29\nAge-Median (years) 15.1\nGender % Male 48.3%\nRace % White 69.0%\n\n% Black 31.0%\n% Asian 0.0%\n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA \n(log10 copies/ml)\n\nMedian \n(Min \u2013 Max)\n\n4.6 (3.0 \u2013 6.8)\n\n% with VL  > \n100,000 copies/ml\n\n27.6%\n\nBaseline CD4+ \n(cells/mm3)\n\nMedian\n(Min \u2013 Max)\n\n330 (12 \u2013 593)\n\n% \u2264 200 27.6%\n\nBaseline % CD4+ cells Median \n(Min \u2013 Max)\n\n18.5% (3.1% \u2013\n37.4%)\n\nPrevious ADI* % with Category C 29.2%\nTreatment history % with any ARV 96.6%\n\nMedian # previous \nNRTIs\n\n5\n\nMedian # previous \nNNRTIs\n\n1\n\nMedian # previous \nPIs\n\n3\n\n\n\n31\n\n* AIDS defining illness\n\nKey efficacy results at 48 weeks for patients 12 \u2013 18 years of age who took capsule\n\nEndpoint Result\nNumber of patients 29\nPrimary efficacy  endpoint: \n% with VL < 400 \n\n31.0%\n\nMedian change from baseline\nin log10 HIV-1 RNA (copies/ml) \n\n-0.79\n\nMedian change from baseline\nin CD4+ cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n39\n\nMedian change from baseline\nin % CD4+ cells \n\n3%\n\nAnalyses of tipranavir resistance in treatment experienced patients\nTipranavir with ritonavir response rates in the RESIST studies were assessed by baseline tipranavir \ngenotype and phenotype.  Relationships between baseline phenotypic susceptibility to tipranavir, \nprimary PI mutations, protease mutations at codons 33, 82, 84 and 90, tipranavir resistance-associated \nmutations, and response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy were assessed.\n\nOf note, patients in the RESIST studies had a specific mutational pattern at baseline of at least one \nprimary protease gene mutation among codons 30N, 46I, 46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or \n90M, and no more than two mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.\n\nThe following observations were made:\n\n\uf02d Primary PI mutations\nAnalyses were conducted to assess virological outcome by the number of primary PI mutations (any \nchange at protease codons 30, 32, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 82, 84, 88 and 90) present at baseline. \nResponse rates were higher in tipranavir with ritonavir patients than comparator PI boosted with \nritonavir in new enfuvirtide patients, or patients without new enfuvirtide. However, without new \nenfuvirtide some patients began to lose antiviral activity between weeks 4 and 8.\n\n\uf02d Mutations at protease codons 33, 82, 84 and 90\nA reduced virological response was observed in patients with viral strains harbouring two or more \nmutations at HIV protease codons 33, 82, 84 or 90, and not receiving new enfuvirtide.\n\n\uf02d Tipranavir resistance-associated mutations\nVirological response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy has been evaluated using a tipranavir-\nassociated mutation score based on baseline genotype in RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 patients. This score \n(counting the 16 amino acids that have been associated with reduced tipranavir susceptibility and/or \nreduced viral load response: 10V, 13V, 20M/R/V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/M/V, 58E, \n69K, 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 84V) was applied to baseline viral protease sequences. A correlation \nbetween the tipranavir mutation score and response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy at week 48 has \nbeen established. \n\nThis score has been determined from the selected RESIST patient population having specific mutation \ninclusion criteria and therefore extrapolation to a wider population mandates caution.\n\nAt 48-weeks, a higher proportion of patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir achieved a treatment \nresponse in comparison to the comparator protease inhibitor/ritonavir for nearly all of the possible \ncombinations of genotypic resistance mutations (see table below).\n\n\n\n32\n\nProportion of patients achieving treatment response at Week 48 (confirmed \u22651 log10 copies/ml \ndecrease in viral load compared to baseline), according to tipranavir baseline mutation score \nand enfuvirtide use in RESIST patients\n\nNew ENF No New \nENF*\n\nNumber of \nTPV Score \nMutations**\n\nTPV/r TPV/r \n\n0,1 73% 53%\n2 61% 33%\n3 75% 27%\n4 59% 23%\n\n\u2265 5 47% 13%\nAll patients 61% 29%\n\n* Includes patients who did not receive ENF and those who were previously treated with and \ncontinued ENF\n**Mutations in HIV protease at positions L10V, I13V, K20M/R/V, L33F, E35G, M36I, K43T, M46L, \nI47V, I54A/M/V, 58E, H69K, T74P, V82L/T, N83D or I84V\nENF Enfuvirtide; TPV/r Tipranavir with ritonavir\n\nSustained HIV-1 RNA decreases up to week 48 were mainly observed in patients who received \ntipranavir with ritonavir and new enfuvirtide.

As demonstrated in a dose-\nranging evaluation in 113 HIV-negative healthy male and female volunteers, ritonavir increases AUC0-\n12h, Cmax and Cmin and decreases the clearance of tipranavir. 500 mg Tipranavir co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir (200 mg; twice daily) was associated with a 29-fold increase in the geometric mean \nmorning steady-state trough plasma concentrations compared to tipranavir 500 mg twice daily without \nritonavir. \n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of tipranavir in humans is limited, though no absolute quantification of absorption is \navailable. Tipranavir is a P-gp substrate, a weak P-gp inhibitor and appears to be a potent P-gp inducer \nas well. Data suggest that, although ritonavir is a P-gp inhibitor, the net effect of Aptivus, co-\nadministered with low dose ritonavir, at the proposed dose regimen at steady-state, is P-gp induction. \nPeak plasma concentrations are reached within 1 to 5 hours after dose administration depending upon \nthe dosage used. With repeated dosing, tipranavir plasma concentrations are lower than predicted from \nsingle dose data, presumably due to hepatic enzyme induction. Steady-state is attained in most subjects \nafter 7 days of dosing. Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, exhibits linear \npharmacokinetics at steady state.\n\nDosing with Aptivus capsules 500 mg twice daily concomitant with 200 mg ritonavir twice daily for 2 \nto 4 weeks and without meal restriction produced a mean tipranavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) \nof 94.8 \u00b1 22.8 \u00b5M for female patients (n=14) and 77.6 \u00b1 16.6 \u00b5M for male patients (n=106), occurring \napproximately 3 hours after administration. The mean steady-state trough concentration prior to the \nmorning dose was 41.6 \u00b1 24.3 \u00b5M for female patients and 35.6 \u00b1 16.7 \u00b5M for male patients. \nTipranavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged 851 \u00b1 309 \u00b5M\u2022h (CL=1.15 l/h) for female \npatients and 710 \u00b1 207 \u00b5M\u2022h (CL=1.27 l/h) for male patients. The mean half-life was 5.5 (females) or \n6.0 hours (males). \n\nEffects of food on oral absorption\nFood improves the tolerability of tipranavir with ritonavir. Therefore Aptivus, co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir, should be given with food. \n\nAbsorption of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is reduced in the presence of \nantacids (see section 4.5). \n\nDistribution\nTipranavir is extensively bound to plasma proteins (>99.9%). From clinical samples of healthy \nvolunteers and HIV-1 positive subjects who received tipranavir without ritonavir the mean fraction of \ntipranavir unbound in plasma was similar in both populations (healthy volunteers 0.015% \uf0b1 0.006%; \nHIV-positive subjects 0.019% \uf0b1 0.076%). Total plasma tipranavir concentrations for these samples \nranged from 9 to 82 \uf06dM. The unbound fraction of tipranavir appeared to be independent of total \nconcentration over this concentration range.  \n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the distribution of tipranavir into human cerebrospinal \nfluid or semen.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro metabolism studies with human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 is the predominant \nCYP isoform involved in tipranavir metabolism. \n\nThe oral clearance of tipranavir decreased after the addition of ritonavir which may represent \ndiminished first-pass clearance of the substance at the gastrointestinal tract as well as the liver. \n\n\n\n34\n\nThe metabolism of tipranavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is minimal. In a 14C-tipranavir \nhuman study (500 mg 14C-tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir,  twice daily), unchanged tipranavir was \npredominant and accounted for 98.4% or greater of the total plasma radioactivity circulating at 3, 8, or \n12 hours after dosing. Only a few metabolites were found in plasma, and all were at trace levels (0.2% \nor less of the plasma radioactivity). In faeces, unchanged tipranavir represented the majority of faecal \nradioactivity (79.9% of faecal radioactivity). The most abundant faecal metabolite, at 4.9% of faecal \nradioactivity (3.2% of dose), was a hydroxyl metabolite of tipranavir. In urine, unchanged tipranavir \nwas found in trace amounts (0.5% of urine radioactivity). The most abundant urinary metabolite, at \n11.0% of urine radioactivity (0.5% of dose) was a glucuronide conjugate of tipranavir.\n\nElimination\nAdministration of 14C-tipranavir to subjects (n = 8) that received 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg \nritonavir; twice daily dosed to steady-state demonstrated that most radioactivity (median 82.3%) was \nexcreted in faeces, while only a median of 4.4% of the radioactive dose administered was recovered in \nurine. In addition, most radioactivity (56%) was excreted between 24 and 96 hours after dosing. The \neffective mean elimination half-life of tipranavir with ritonavir in healthy volunteers (n = 67) and \nHIV-infected adult patients (n = 120) was approximately 4.8 and 6.0 hours, respectively, at steady \nstate following a dose of 500 mg/200 mg twice daily with a light meal. \n\nSpecial populations\nAlthough data available at this stage are currently limited to allow a definitive analysis, they suggest \nthat the pharmacokinetic profile is unchanged in older people and comparable between races. By \ncontrast, evaluation of the steady-state plasma tipranavir trough concentrations at 10-14 h after dosing \nfrom the RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 studies demonstrate that females generally had higher tipranavir \nconcentrations than males. After four weeks of Aptivus 500 mg with 200 mg ritonavir (twice daily) \nthe median plasma trough concentration of tipranavir was 43.9 \u00b5M for females and 31.1 \u00b5M for males. \nThis difference in concentrations does not warrant a dose adjustment.\n\nRenal impairment\nTipranavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However, since \nthe renal clearance of tipranavir is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in \npatients with renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn a study comparing 9 patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment to 9 controls, the single \nand multiple dose exposure of tipranavir and ritonavir were increased in patients with hepatic \nimpairment but still within the range observed in clinical studies.  No dosing adjustment is required in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment but patients should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4).\n\nThe influence of moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment on the \nmultiple dose pharmacokinetics of either tipranavir or ritonavir has so far not been investigated. \ntipranavir is contraindicated in moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe oral solution has been shown to have greater bioavailability than the soft capsule formulation.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted with tipranavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs, and co-\nadministered with ritonavir (3.75:1 w/w ratio) in rats and dogs. Studies with co-administration of \ntipranavir and ritonavir did not reveal any additional toxicological effects when compared to those \nseen in the tipranavir single agent toxicological studies.\n\nThe predominant effects of repeated administration of tipranavir across all species toxicologically \ntested were on the gastrointestinal tract (emesis, soft stool, diarrhoea) and the liver (hypertrophy). The \neffects were reversible with termination of treatment. Additional changes included bleeding in rats at \n\n\n\n35\n\nhigh doses (rodents specific). Bleeding observed in rats was associated with prolonged prothrombin \ntime (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and a decrease in some vitamin K dependent \nfactors. The co-administration of tipranavir with vitamin E in the form of TPGS (d-alphatocopherol \npolyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) from 2,322 IU/m\u00b2 upwards in rats resulted in a significant \nincrease in effects on coagulation parameters, bleeding events and death. In preclinical studies of \ntipranavir in dogs, an effect on coagulation parameters was not seen. Co-administration of tipranavir \nand vitamin E has not been studied in dogs. \n\nThe majority of the effects in repeat-dose toxicity studies appeared at systemic exposure levels which \nare equivalent to or even below the human exposure levels at the recommended clinical dose. \n\nIn in vitro studies, tipranavir was found to inhibit platelet aggregation when using human platelets (see \nsection 4.4) and thromboxane A2 binding in an in vitro cell model at levels consistent with exposure \nobserved in patients receiving Aptivus with ritonavir. The clinical implications of these findings are \nnot known.\n\nIn a study conducted in rats with tipranavir at systemic exposure levels (AUC) equivalent to human \nexposure at the recommended clinical dose, no adverse effects on mating or fertility were observed. At \nmaternal doses producing systemic exposure levels similar to or below those at the recommended \nclinical dose, tipranavir did not produce teratogenic effects. At tipranavir exposures in rats at 0.8-fold \nhuman exposure at the clinical dose, foetal toxicity (decreased sternebrae ossification and body \nweights) was observed. In pre- and post-natal development studies with tipranavir in rats, growth \ninhibition of pups was observed at maternally toxic doses approximating 0.8-fold human exposure. \n\nCarcinogenicity studies of tipranavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for \nthese species, which are regarded as of no clinical relevance. Tipranavir showed no evidence of \ngenetic toxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n\n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nOral solution.\n\nClear yellow viscous liquid.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nAptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment \nof HIV-1 infection in highly pre-treated children from 2 to 12 years of age with virus resistant to \nmultiple protease inhibitors. Aptivus should only be used as part of an active combination \nantiretroviral regimen in patients with no other therapeutic options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\nIn deciding to initiate treatment with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful \nconsideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of \nmutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and \ntreatment history should guide the use of Aptivus. Initiation of treatment should take into account the \ncombinations of mutations which may negatively impact the virological response to Aptivus, co-\nadministered with low dose ritonavir (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nAptivus must always be given with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, and in \ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of \nritonavir must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with Aptivus (especially as regards \nthe contraindications, warnings and undesirable effects sections).\n\nAptivus should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. \n\nAptivus with ritonavir should not be used in treatment-na\u00efve patients.\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose for children (age 2 to 12 years) is 375 mg/m2 Aptivus co-administered with \n150 mg/m2 ritonavir, twice daily. The paediatric dose should not exceed the 500 mg/200 mg dose.\n\nAptivus/ritonavir dose (375 mg/m2 Aptivus + 150 mg/m2 ritonavir)\n\nBSA Range \n(m2)\n\nDose \nAptivus\n\n(mg)\nVolume \n\nAptivus (ml)\n\nDose \nritonavir\n\n(mg)\n\nVolume \nritonavir\n\n(ml)\n0.37 \u2013 0.42 140 1.4 56 0.7\n0.43 \u2013 0.47 160 1.6 63 0.8\n\n\n\n38\n\n0.48 \u2013 0.52 180 1.8 71 0.9\n0.53 \u2013 0.58 200 2 79 1\n0.59 \u2013 0.63 220 2.2 87 1.1\n0.64 \u2013 0.68 240 2.4 95 1.2\n\n0.69 - 0.74 260 2.6 103 1.3\n0.75 \u2013 0.79 280 2.8 111 1.4\n0.80 \u2013 0.84 300 3 119 1.5\n0.85 \u2013 0.90 320 3.2 127 1.6\n0.91 \u2013 0.95 340 3.4 135 1.7\n0.96 \u2013 1.00 360 3.6 143 1.8\n\n1.01 - 1.06 380 3.8 151 1.9\n1.07 \u2013 1.11 400 4 159 2\n1.12 \u2013 1.16 420 4.2 167 2.1\n1.17 \u2013 1.22 440 4.4 174 2.2\n1.23 \u2013 1.27 460 4.6 182 2.3\n1.28 \u2013 1.32 480 4.8 190 2.4\n\n> 1.33 500 5 200 2.5\n\nDoses of ritonavir lower than 150 mg/m2 twice daily, should not be used as they might alter the \nefficacy profile of the combination.\n\nAptivus is available as soft capsules for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age (please refer to \nthe respective SmPC for further details). Patients treated with Aptivus and reaching the age of 12 years \nshould be switched to the capsule formulation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nMissed dose\nPatients should be advised of the need to take Aptivus and ritonavir every day as prescribed. If a dose \nis missed by more than 5 hours, the patient should be instructed to wait and then to take the next dose \nof tipranavir and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If a dose is missed by less than 5 hours, the \npatient should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately, and then to take the next dose of \ntipranavir and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time.\n\nLiver impairment\nTipranavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. Liver impairment could therefore result in an increase \nof tipranavir exposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, Aptivus should be used with \ncaution, and with increased monitoring frequency, in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh Class A). Aptivus is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or \nC) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Aptivus in children under 2 years of age has not been established. No data \nare available. \n\nMethod of administration \nOral use.\nAptivus oral solution co-administered with low dose oral solution ritonavir should be taken with food \n(see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment. \n\n\n\n39\n\nCombination of rifampicin with Aptivus with concomitant low dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nHerbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to the risk of decreased \nplasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of tipranavir (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of Aptivus with low dose ritonavir, with active substances that are highly dependent \non CYP3A for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious \nand/or life-threatening events. These active substances include antiarrhythmics (such as amiodarone, \nbepridil, quinidine), antihistamines (such as astemizole, terfenadine), ergot derivatives (such as \ndihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine), gastrointestinal motility agents (such \nas cisapride), antipsychotics (such as pimozide, sertindole, quetiapine, lurasidone), sedatives/hypnotics \n(such as orally administered midazolam and triazolam) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as \nsimvastatin and lovastatin) (see section 4.5). Also the use of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist \nalfuzosin, and sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, \nco-administration of Aptivus with low dose ritonavir, and medicinal products that are highly \ndependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and \nmetoprolol given in heart failure (see section 4.5).\n\nCo-administration of colchicine with Aptivus/ritonavir in patients with renal or hepatic impairment \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nAptivus must be administered with low dose ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect (see section 4.2). \nFailure to correctly co-administer tipranavir with ritonavir will result in reduced plasma levels of \ntipranavir that may be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Patients should be instructed \naccordingly. \n\nAptivus is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS. Patients receiving Aptivus or any other \nantiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV-1 infection.\n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nSwitching from Aptivus capsules to the oral solution\nAptivus capsules are not interchangeable with the oral solution. Compared to the capsules, tipranavir \nexposure is higher when administering the same dose as oral solution. Also, the composition of the \noral solution is different from that of the capsules, with the high vitamin E content being especially \nnoteworthy. Both of these factors may contribute to an increased risk of adverse reactions (type, \nfrequency and/or severity). Therefore patients should not be switched from Aptivus capsules to \nAptivus oral solution (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n\nSwitching from Aptivus oral solution to the capsules\nAptivus oral solution is not interchangeable with the capsules. Compared to the oral solution, \ntipranavir exposure is lower when administering the same dose as capsules. However, children \npreviously treated with Aptivus oral solution and becoming 12 years of age should be switched to \ncapsules, particularly because of the more favourable safety profile of the capsules. It has to be noted \nthat the switch from the oral solution to the capsule formulation of Aptivus could be associated with \ndecreased exposure. Therefore, it is recommended that patients switching from Aptivus oral solution \nto capsules at the age of 12 years are closely monitored for the virologic response of their \nantiretroviral regimen (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).\n\n\n\n40\n\nLiver disease\nAptivus is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh Class B or C) hepatic \ninsufficiency. Limited data are currently available for the use of Aptivus, co-administered with low \ndose ritonavir, in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and \ntreated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal \nhepatic adverse reaction. Aptivus should be used in this patient population only if the potential benefit \noutweighs the potential risk, and with increased clinical and laboratory monitoring. In the case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) should be closely monitored.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination therapy and should be monitored \naccording to standard practice. Aptivus with ritonavir should be discontinued once signs of worsening \nliver function occur in patients with pre-existing liver disease.\n\nAptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, has been associated with reports of clinical hepatitis \nand hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients with \nadvanced HIV disease taking multiple concomitant medicinal products. Caution should be exercised \nwhen administering Aptivus to patients with liver enzyme abnormalities or with a history of hepatitis. \nIncreased ALAT/ASAT monitoring should be considered in these patients.\n\nAptivus therapy should not be initiated in patients with pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT greater than 5 \ntimes the Upper Limit Normal (ULN) until baseline ASAT/ALAT is stabilised at less than 5X ULN, \nunless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.\n\nAptivus therapy should be discontinued in patients experiencing ASAT or ALAT elevations greater \nthan 10X ULN, or developing signs or symptoms of clinical hepatitis during therapy. If another cause \nis identified (e.g. acute hepatitis A, B or C virus, gallbladder disease, other medicinal products), then \nrechallenge with Aptivus may be considered when ASAT/ALAT have returned to the patient\u2019s \nbaseline levels.\n\nLiver monitoring\nMonitoring of hepatic tests should be done prior to initiation of therapy, after two, four and then every \nfour weeks until 24 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter. Increased monitoring (i.e. \nprior to initiation of therapy, every two weeks during the first three months of treatment, then monthly \nuntil 48 weeks, and then every eight to twelve weeks thereafter) is warranted when Aptivus and low \ndose ritonavir are administered to patients with elevated ASAT and ALAT levels, mild hepatic \nimpairment, chronic hepatitis B or C, or other underlying liver disease.\n\nTreatment-na\u00efve patients\nIn a study performed in antiretroviral na\u00efve adult patients, tipranavir 500 mg with ritonavir 200 mg \ntwice daily, as compared to lopinavir/ritonavir, was associated with an excess in the occurrence of \nsignificant (grade 3 and 4) transaminase elevations without any advantage in terms of efficacy (trend \ntowards a lower efficacy). The study was prematurely stopped after 60 weeks.\nTherefore, tipranavir with ritonavir should not be used in treatment-na\u00efve patients.\n\nRenal impairment\nSince the renal clearance of tipranavir is negligible, increased plasma concentrations are not expected \nin patients with renal impairment.\n\nHaemophilia\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some \npatients additional Factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with \nprotease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal \n\n\n\n41\n\nrelationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated. \nHaemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n\nBleeding\nRESIST participants receiving Aptivus with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at \n24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to \n1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between \ntreatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further \nmonitored.\n\nFatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhages (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving Aptivus, \nmany of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that \nmay have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of Aptivus cannot be \nexcluded. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in \npatients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of \ncoagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on Aptivus.\n\nAn increased risk of ICH has previously been observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS \nsuch as those treated in the Aptivus clinical trials.\n\nIn in vitro experiments, tipranavir was observed to inhibit human platelet aggregation at levels \nconsistent with exposures observed in patients receiving Aptivus with ritonavir.\n\nIn rats, co-administration with vitamin E increased the bleeding effects of tipranavir (see section 5.3).\n\nAptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who may be \nat risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving \nmedicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and \nanticoagulants or who are taking supplemental vitamin E. Patients taking Aptivus oral solution should \nbe advised not to take any supplemental vitamin E.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. A higher increase of blood lipids were seen with tipranavir/ritonavir \nthan with comparators (other protease inhibitors) in clinical trials. For monitoring of blood lipids and \nglucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed \nas clinically appropriate.\n\nImmune reactivation syndrome\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \npneumocystis pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted \nwhen necessary. In addition, reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in \nclinical studies with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nRash\nMild to moderate rashes including urticarial rash, maculopapular rash, and photosensitivity have been \nreported in subjects receiving Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir. At 48-weeks in Phase \n\n\n\n42\n\nIII trials, rash of various types was observed in 15.5% males and 20.5% females receiving Aptivus co-\nadministered with low dose ritonavir. Additionally, in one interaction trial, in healthy female \nvolunteers administered a single dose of ethinyl oestradiol followed by Aptivus co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir, 33% of subjects developed a rash. Rash accompanied by joint pain or stiffness, \nthroat tightness, or generalized pruritus has been reported in both men and women receiving Aptivus\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir. In the paediatric clinical trial, the frequency of rash (all \ngrades, all causality) through 48 weeks of treatment was higher than in adult patients.\n\nOsteonecrosis\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nInteractions\nThe interaction profile of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex. The \nmechanisms and potential mechanisms contributing to the interaction profile of tipranavir are \ndescribed (see section 4.5).\n\nAbacavir and zidovudine \nThe concomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with zidovudine or \nabacavir, results in a significant decrease in plasma concentration of these nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Therefore, the concomitant use of zidovudine or abacavir with \nAptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not-recommended unless there are no other \navailable NRTIs suitable for patient management (see section 4.5).\n\nProtease inhibitors\nConcomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with the protease inhibitors \namprenavir, lopinavir or saquinavir (each co-administered with low dose ritonavir) in a dual-boosted \nregimen, results in significant decreases in plasma concentrations of these protease inhibitors. A \nsignificant decrease in plasma concentrations of atazanavir and a marked increase of tipranavir and \nritonavir concentrations was observed when Aptivus, associated with low dose ritonavir, was co-\nadministered with atazanavir (see section 4.5). No data are currently available on interactions of \ntipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with protease inhibitors other than those listed \nabove. Therefore, the co-administration of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with \nprotease inhibitors is not recommended.\n\nOral contraceptives and oestrogens \nSince levels of ethinyl oestradiol are decreased, the co-administration of Aptivus co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir is not recommended. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures are to be \nused when oestrogen based oral contraceptives are co-administered with Aptivus co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir (see section 4.5). Patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should \nbe clinically monitored for signs of oestrogen deficiency. Women using oestrogens may have an \nincreased risk of non serious rash.\n\nAnticonvulsants\nCaution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Aptivus may \nbe less effective due to decreased tipranavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents \nconcomitantly (see section 4.5).\n\nHalofantrine, lumefantrine\nDue to their metabolic profile and inherent risk of inducing torsades de pointes, administration of \nhalofantrine and lumefantrine with Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n43\n\nFluticasone\nConcomitant use of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and fluticasone or other \nglucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of \ntreatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and \nadrenal suppression (see section 4.5).\n\nAtorvastatin\nTipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, increases the plasma concentrations of \natorvastatin (see section 4.5). The combination is not recommended. Other HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitors should be considered such as pravastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin (see section 4.5). \nHowever, if atorvastatin is specifically required for patient management, it should be started with the \nlowest dose and careful monitoring is necessary.\n\nOmeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors\nThe combined use of Aptivus with ritonavir with either omeprazole, esomeprazole or with other \nproton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n\nColchicine \nIn patients with normal renal and hepatic function, a reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption \nof colchicine treatment is recommended in co-administration (see section 4.5).\n\nSalmeterol\nConcomitant use of salmeterol and Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is not \nrecommended (see section 4.5).\n\nBosentan\nDue to the marked hepatotoxicity of bosentan and the potential for increasing the liver toxicity \nassociated with Aptivus,co-administered with low dose ritonavir, this combination is not \nrecommended.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe interaction profile of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex and requires \nspecial attention in particular in combination with other antiretroviral agents.\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nMetabolic profile of tipranavir\nTipranavir is a substrate, an inducer and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A. When co-\nadministered with ritonavir at the recommended dosage (see section 4.2) there is a net inhibition of \nP450 CYP3A. Co-administration of Aptivus and low dose ritonavir with agents primarily metabolised \nby CYP3A may result in changed plasma concentrations of tipranavir or the other agents, which could \nalter their therapeutic and undesirable effects (see list and details of considered agents, below). Agents \nthat are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for \nserious adverse reactions are detailed in this section, and listed in section 4.3.\n\nA cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily tipranavir 500 mg with \nritonavir 200 mg capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic \nCYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 \n(midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (digoxin). At steady state, there was a significant induction of \nCYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and \nintestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. P-gp activity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, \nbut there was a slight induction at steady state. Practical recommendations deriving from this study are \ndisplayed below. This study was also conducted with Aptivus oral solution 500 mg with ritonavir \n200 mg and showed the same CYP P450 and P-gp interactions as the Aptivus capsule 500 mg  with \nritonavir 200 mg. Based on the results from this study, Aptivus oral solution might be expected to \nhave a similar interaction profile as the capsules.\n\n\n\n44\n\nStudies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP \n2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, \nbecause ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor. The in vivo net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on \nCYP 1A2, CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19, indicates, through a preliminary study, an inducing potential of \ntipranavir with ritonavir on CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, on CYP2C9 and P-gp after several days of \ntreatment. Data are not available to indicate whether tipranavir inhibits or induces glucuronosyl \ntransferases. \n\nIn vitro studies show that tipranavir is a substrate and also an inhibitor of P-gp. \n\nIt is difficult to predict the net effect of Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir on oral \nbioavailability and plasma concentrations of agents that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. The \nnet effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co-administered substance for CYP3A and \nP-gp, and the extent of intestinal first-pass metabolism/efflux.\n\nCo-administration of Aptivus and agents that induce CYP3A and/or P-gp may decrease tipranavir \nconcentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect (see list and details of considered agents, below). Co-\nadministration of Aptivus and medicinal products that inhibit P-gp may increase tipranavir plasma \nconcentrations.\n\nKnown and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in the table below.\n\nInteraction table\nInteractions between Aptivus and co-administered medicinal products are listed in the table below \n(increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d,once daily as \u201cQD\u201d, twice daily as \n\u201cBID\u201d, concentration at end of dosing interval as \u201cC\u03c4\u201d).\nUnless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of \nAptivus/r (i.e. 500/200 mg BID).

Systemic corticosteroid \neffects including Cushing's \nsyndrome and adrenal suppression \nhave been reported in patients \nreceiving ritonavir and inhaled or \nintranasally administered \nfluticasone propionate; this could \nalso occur with other corticosteroids\nmetabolised via the P450 3A \npathway e.g. budesonide. \nIt is unknown whether the \ncombination of tipranavir with \nritonavir might cause a larger \nincrease in fluticasone exposure.\n\nConcomitant administration of \nAptivus, co-administered with low \ndose ritonavir, and these \nglucocorticoids is not recommended \nunless the potential benefit of \ntreatment outweighs the risk of \nsystemic corticosteroid effects (see \nsection 4.4). A dose reduction of the \nglucocorticoid should be considered \nwith close monitoring of local and \nsystemic effects or a switch to a \nglucocorticoid, which is not a \nsubstrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. \nbeclomethasone). Moreover, in case \nof withdrawal of glucocorticoids \nprogressive dose reduction may \nhave to be performed over a longer \nperiod. The effects of high \nfluticasone systemic exposure on \nritonavir plasma levels are as yet \nunknown.\n\n\n\n58\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nContraception in males and females\nTipranavir adversely interacts with oral contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative, effective, safe \nmethod of contraception should be used during treatment (see section 4.5).\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no adequate data from the use of tipranavir in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Tipranavir \nshould be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nBreastfeeding\nConsistent with the recommendation that HIV-infected mothers should not breast-feed their infants \nunder any circumstances to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV, mothers should discontinue \nbreast-feeding if they are receiving Aptivus.\n\nFertility\nClinical data on fertility are not available for tipranavir. Preclinical studies performed with tipranavir \nshowed no adverse effect on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDizziness, somnolence, and fatigue have been reported in some patients; therefore, caution should be \nrecommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If patients experience fatigue, dizziness, or \nsomnolence they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nAmongst the most common adverse reactions reported for Aptivus were gastrointestinal complaints \nsuch as diarrhoea and nausea as well as hyperlipidaemia. The most serious adverse reactions include \nhepatic impairment and liver toxicity. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) was only observed in post \nmarketing experience (see section 4.4).\n\nAptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir, has been associated with reports of significant liver \ntoxicity. In Phase III RESIST trials, the frequency of transaminase elevations was significantly \nincreased in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm compared to the comparator arm. Close monitoring is \ntherefore needed in patients treated with Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir (see section \n4.4).\n\nLimited data are currently available for the use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, in \npatients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Aptivus should therefore be used with caution in patients \nco-infected with hepatitis B or C. Aptivus should be used in this patient population only if the \npotential benefit outweighs the potential risk, and with increased clinical and laboratory monitoring.\n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions\nAssessment of adverse reactions from HIV-1 clinical study data is based on experience in all Phase II \nand III trials in adults treated with the 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir dose twice daily \n(n=1397) and are listed below by system organ class and frequency according to the following \ncategories:\nVery common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to \uf03c1/100), \nrare (\u22651/10,000 to \uf03c1/1,000) \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions associated with Aptivus based on clinical studies and post-\nmarketing experience:\n\n\n\n59\n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders\nuncommon neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia\nImmune system disorders\n\nuncommon hypersensitivity\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders\n\ncommon hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperlipidaemia\nuncommon anorexia, decreased appetite, weight decreased, \n\nhyperamylasaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, \ndiabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia\n\nrare dehydration\n\nPsychiatric disorders\n\nuncommon insomnia, sleep disorder\n\nNervous system disorders\n\ncommon headache\n\nuncommon dizziness, neuropathy peripheral, somnolence\n\nrare intracranial haemorrhage*\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\nuncommon dyspnoea\n\nGastrointestinal disorders\n\nvery common diarrhoea, nausea\n\ncommon vomiting, flatulence, abdominal pain, abdominal \ndistension, dyspepsia\n\nuncommon gastrooesophageal reflux disease, pancreatitis\n\nrare lipase increased\n\nHepatobiliary disorders\n\nuncommon hepatic enzyme increased (ALAT, ASAT), \ncytolytic hepatitis, liver function test abnormal \n(ALAT, ASAT), hepatitis toxic\n\nrare hepatic failure (including fatal outcome), \nhepatitis, hepatic steatosis, hyperbilirubinaemia\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders\n\ncommon rash\n\nuncommon pruritus, exanthem\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\nuncommon myalgia, muscle spasms\n\nRenal and urinary disorders\n\nuncommon renal failure\n\n\n\n60\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\ncommon fatigue\n\nuncommon pyrexia, influenza like illness, malaise\n\n* see section Description of selected adverse reactions \u201cBleeding\u201d for source of information\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nThe following clinical safety features (hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidaemia, bleeding events, rash) were \nseen at higher frequency among tipranavir with ritonavir treated patients when compared with the \ncomparator arm treated patients in the RESIST trials, or have been observed with tipranavir with \nritonavir administration. The clinical significance of these observations has not been fully explored.  \n\nHepatotoxicity \nAfter 48 weeks of follow-up, the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 ALAT and/or ASAT abnormalities was \nhigher in tipranavir with ritonavir patients compared with comparator arm patients (10% and 3.4%, \nrespectively). Multivariate analyses showed that baseline ALAT or ASAT above DAIDS Grade 1 and \nco-infection with hepatitis B or C were risk factors for these elevations. Most patients were able to \ncontinue treatment with tipranavir with ritonavir. \n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n4.4)\n\nHyperlipidaemia \nGrade 3 or 4 elevations of triglycerides occurred more frequently in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm \ncompared with the comparator arm. At 48 weeks these rates were 25.2% of patients in the tipranavir\nwith ritonavir arm and 15.6% in the comparator arm.  \n\nBleeding \nThis adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in \nrandomised controlled clinical trials (n=6300).\nRESIST participants receiving tipranavir with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at \n24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to \n1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between \ntreatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further \nmonitored.\nFatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving tipranavir, \nmany of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that \nmay have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of tipranavir cannot \nbe excluded. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in \npatients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Therefore, routine measurement of \ncoagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on Aptivus.\nAn increased risk of ICH has previously been observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS \nsuch as those treated in the Aptivus clinical trials.\n\nRash\nAn interaction study in women between tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and \nethinyl oestradiol/norethindrone demonstrated a high frequency of non-serious rash. In the RESIST \ntrials, the risk of rash was similar between tipranavir with ritonavir and comparator arms (16.3% vs. \n12.5%, respectively; see section 4.4). No cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal \nNecrolysis have been reported in the clinical development programme of tipranavir.\n\nLaboratory abnormalities\nFrequencies of marked clinical laboratory abnormalities (Grade 3 or 4) reported in at least 2% of \npatients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arms in the phase III clinical studies (RESIST-1 and RESIST-\n2) after 48-weeks were increased ASAT (6.1%), increased ALAT (9.7%), increased amylase (6.0%), \n\n\n\n61\n\nincreased cholesterol (4.2%), increased triglycerides (24.9%), and decreased white blood cell count \n(5.7%).\n\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with protease \ninhibitors, particularly in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). Reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes \nzoster virus infections were observed in the RESIST trials.\n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).\n\nPaediatric population\nIn an open-label, dose-finding study of tipranavir plus ritonavir (Trial 1182.14), 62 children aged 2 to \n12 years received Aptivus oral solution. In general, adverse reactions were similar to those seen in \nadults, with the exception of vomiting, rash and pyrexia which were reported more frequently in \nchildren than in adults. The most frequently reported moderate or severe adverse reactions in the \n48 week analyses are noted below. \n\nMost frequently reported moderate or severe adverse reactions in paediatric patients age 2 to < \n12 years (reported in 2 or more children, Trial 1182.14, 48 weeks analyses, Full Analysis Set).\n\nTotal patients treated (N) 62\nEvents [N(%)]\nDiarrhoea 4 (6.5)\nVomiting 3 (4.8)\nNausea 3 (4.8)\nAbdominal pain1 3 (4.8)\nPyrexia 4 (6.5)\nRash2 4 (6.5)\ngamma GT increased 4 (6.5)\nALAT increased 2 (3.2)\nAnaemia 2 (3.2)\n\n1 Includes abdominal pain (N=1), dysphagia (N=1) and epigastric discomfort (N=1). \n2 Rash consists of one or more of the preferred terms of rash, drug eruption, rash macular, rash papular, erythema, rash \nmaculo-papular, rash pruritic, and urticaria.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nHuman experience with tipranavir overdose is very limited. No specific signs and symptoms of \noverdose are known. Generally, an increased frequency and higher severity of adverse reactions may \nresult from overdose.\n\nThere is no known antidote for tipranavir overdose. Treatment of overdose should consist of general \nsupportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient\u2019s clinical \nstatus. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed tipranavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n62\n\nlavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed \nsubstance. Since tipranavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant \nremoval of this medicine.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE09\n\nMechanism of action\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) encodes an aspartyl protease that is essential for the \ncleavage and maturation of viral protein precursors. Tipranavir is a non-peptidic inhibitor of the HIV-1 \nprotease that inhibits viral replication by preventing the maturation of viral particles.\n\nAntiviral activity in vitro\nTipranavir inhibits the replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1 and clinical isolates in acute models \nof T-cell infection, with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90) ranging from 0.03 to \n0.07 \u00b5M (18-42 ng/ml) and 0.07 to 0.18 \u00b5M (42-108 ng/ml), respectively. Tipranavir demonstrates \nantiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M non-clade B isolates (A, C, D, F, G, \nH, CRF01 AE, CRF02 AG, CRF12 BF). Group O and HIV-2 isolates have reduced susceptibility in \nvitro to tipranavir with EC50 values ranging from 0.164-1 \u00b5M and 0.233-0.522 \u00b5M, respectively. \nProtein binding studies have shown that the antiviral activity of tipranavir decreases on average 3.75-\nfold in conditions where human serum is present. \n\nResistance\nThe development of resistance to tipranavir in vitro is slow and complex. In one particular in vitro\nresistance experiment, an HIV-1 isolate that was 87-fold resistant to tipranavir was selected after 9 \nmonths, and contained 10 mutations in the protease: L10F, I13V, V32I, L33F, M36I, K45I, I54V/T, \nA71V, V82L, I84V as well as a mutation in the gag polyprotein CA/P2 cleavage site. Reverse genetic \nexperiments showed that the presence of 6 mutations in the protease (I13V, V32I, L33F, K45I, V82L, \nI84V) was required to confer > 10-fold resistance to tipranavir while the full 10-mutation genotype \nconferred 69-fold resistance to tipranavir. In vitro, there is an inverse correlation between the degree \nof resistance to tipranavir and the capacity of viruses to replicate. Recombinant viruses showing \u2265 3-\nfold resistance to tipranavir grow at less than 1% of the rate detected for wild type HIV-1 in the same \nconditions. Tipranavir resistant viruses which emerge in vitro from wild-type HIV-1 show decreased \nsusceptibility to the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and \nritonavir but remain sensitive to saquinavir. \n\nThrough a series of multiple stepwise regression analyses of baseline and on-treatment genotypes from \nall clinical studies, 16 amino acids have been associated with reduced tipranavir susceptibility and/or \nreduced 48-week viral load response: 10V, 13V, 20M/R/V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/M/V, \n58E, 69K, 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 84V. Clinical isolates that exhibited a \uf0b3 10-fold decrease in tipranavir \nsusceptibility harboured 8 or more tipranavir-associated mutations. In Phase II and III clinical trials, \n276 patients with on-treatment genotypes have demonstrated that the predominant emerging mutations \nwith tipranavir treatment are L33F/I/V, V82T/L and I84V. Combination of all three of these is usually \nrequired for reduced susceptibility. Mutations at position 82 occur via two pathways: one from pre-\nexisting mutation 82A selecting to 82T, the other from wild type 82V selecting to 82L.\n\nCross-resistance\nTipranavir maintains significant antiviral activity (< 4-fold resistance) against the majority of HIV-1 \nclinical isolates showing post-treatment decreased susceptibility to the currently approved protease \ninhibitors: amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir. Greater \nthan 10-fold resistance to tipranavir is uncommon (< 2.5% of tested isolates) in viruses obtained from \nhighly treatment experienced patients who have received multiple peptidic protease inhibitors.\n\n\n\n63\n\nECG evaluation\nThe effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a study in \nwhich 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: \ntipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and \nplacebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF \nchange was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% \nUpper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at therapeutic dose \nwith low dose of ritonavir did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.\n\nClinical pharmacodynamic data\nThis indication is based on the results of one phase II study investigating pharmacokinetics, safety and \nefficacy of Aptivus oral solution in mostly treatment-experienced children aged 2 to 12 years.\n\nThe following clinical data is derived from analyses of 48-week data from ongoing studies (RESIST-1 \nand RESIST-2) measuring effects on plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. RESIST-1 and \nRESIST-2 are ongoing, randomised, open-label, multicentre studies in HIV-positive, triple-class \nexperienced patients, evaluating treatment with tipranavir 500 mg co-administered with low dose \nritonavir 200 mg (twice daily) plus an optimised background regimen (OBR) individually defined for \neach patient based on genotypic resistance testing and patient history. The comparator regimen \nincluded a ritonavir-boosted PI (also individually defined) plus an OBR. The ritonavir-boosted PI was \nchosen from among saquinavir, amprenavir, indinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir.  \n\nAll patients had received at least two PI-based antiretroviral regimens and were failing a PI-based \nregimen at the time of study entry. At least one primary protease gene mutation from among 30N, 46I, \n46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or 90M had to be present at baseline, with not more than \ntwo mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.\n\nAfter Week 8, patients in the comparator arm who met the protocol defined criteria of initial lack of \nvirologic response had the option of discontinuing treatment and switching over to tipranavir with \nritonavir in a separate roll-over study. \n\nThe 1483 patients included in the primary analysis had a median age of 43 years (range 17-80), were \n86% male, 75% white, 13% black and 1% Asian. In the tipranavir and comparator arms median \nbaseline CD4 cell counts were 158 and 166 cells/mm3, respectively, (ranges 1-1893 and 1-\n1184 cells/mm3); median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.79 and 4.80 log10 copies/ml, respectively \n(ranges 2.34-6.52 and 2.01-6.76 log10 copies/ml). \n\nPatients had prior exposure to a median of 6 NRTIs, 1 NNRTI, and 4 PIs. In both studies, a total of \n67% patient viruses were resistant and 22% were possibly resistant to the pre-selected comparator PIs. \nA total of 10% of patients had previously used enfuvirtide. Patients had baseline HIV-1 isolates with a \nmedian of 16 HIV-1 protease gene mutations, including a median of 3 primary protease gene \nmutations D30N, L33F/I, V46I/L, G48V, I50V, V82A/F/T/L, I84V, and L90M. With respect to \nmutations on codons 33, 82, 84 and 90 approximately 4% had no mutations, 24% had mutations at \ncodons 82 (less than 1% of patients had the mutation V82L) and 90, 18% had mutations at codons 84 \nand 90 and 53% had at least one key mutation at codon 90. One patient in the tipranavir arm had four \nmutations. In addition the majority of participants had mutations associated with both NRTI and \nNNRTI resistance. Baseline phenotypic susceptibility was evaluated in 454 baseline patient samples.  \nThere was an average decrease in susceptibility of 2-fold wild type (WT) for tipranavir, 12-fold WT \nfor amprenavir, 55-fold WT for atazanavir, 41-fold WT for indinavir, 87-fold WT for lopinavir, 41-\nfold WT for nelfinavir, 195-fold WT for ritonavir, and 20-fold WT for saquinavir.\n\nCombined 48-week treatment response (composite endpoint defined as patients with a confirmed \n\uf0b31 log RNA drop from baseline and without evidence of treatment failure) for both studies was 34% \nin the tipranavir with ritonavir arm and 15% in the comparator arm. Treatment response is presented \nfor the overall population (displayed by enfuvirtide use), and detailed by PI strata for the subgroup of \npatients with genotypically resistant strains in the Table below. \n\n\n\n64\n\nTreatment response* at week 48 (pooled studies RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 in treatment-\nexperienced patients)\n\nRESIST study Tipranavir /RTV CPI/RTV** p-value\n\nn (%) N n (%) N\nOverall population\nFAS\nPP\n\n255 (34.2)\n171 (37.7)\n\n746\n454\n\n114 (15.5)\n74 (17.1)\n\n737\n432\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n\uf03c0.0001\n\n- with ENF (FAS) 85 (50.0) 170 28 (20.7) 135 \uf03c0.0001\n- without ENF (FAS) 170 (29.5) 576 86 (14.3) 602 \uf03c0.0001\n\nGenotypically Resistant\nLPV/rtv  \nFAS\nPP\n\n66 (28.9)\n47 (32.2)\n\n228\n146\n\n23 (9.5)\n13 (9.1)\n\n242\n143\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n\uf03c0.0001\n\nAPV/rtv\nFAS\nPP\n\n50 (33.3)\n38 (39.2)\n\n150\n97\n\n22 (14.9)\n17 (18.3)\n\n148\n93\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n0.0010\n\nSQV/rtv\nFAS\nPP\n\n22 (30.6)\n11 (28.2)\n\n72\n39\n\n5 (7.0)\n2 (5.7)\n\n71\n35\n\n\uf03c0.0001\n0.0650\n\nIDV/rtv\nFAS\nPP\n\n6 (46.2)\n3 (50.0)\n\n13\n6\n\n1 (5.3)\n1 (7.1)\n\n19\n14\n\n0.0026\n0.0650\n\n* Composite endpoint defined as patients with a confirmed 1 log RNA drop from baseline and without \nevidence of treatment failure \n** Comparator PI/RTV: LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg twice daily (n=358), IDV/r 800 mg/100 mg twice \ndaily (n=23), SQV/r 1000 mg/100 mg twice daily or 800 mg/200 mg twice daily (n=162), APV/r \n600 mg/100 mg twice daily (n=194)\nENF Enfuvirtide; FAS Full Analysis Set; PP Per Protocol; APV/rtv Amprenavir/ritonavir; IDV/rtv\nIndinavir/ritonavir; LPV/rtv Lopinavir/ritonavir; SQV/rtv Saquinavir/ritonavir\n\nCombined 48-week median time to treatment failure for both studies was 115 days in the tipranavir\nwith ritonavir arm and 0 days in the comparator arm (no treatment response was imputed to day 0).\n\nThrough 48 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients in the tipranavir with ritonavir arm \ncompared to the comparator PI/ritonavir arm with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml was 30% and 14% \nrespectively, and with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml was 23% and 10% respectively. Among all \nrandomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the last \nmeasurement up to Week 48 was -0.64 log10 copies/ml in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir \nversus -0.22 log10 copies/ml in the comparator PI/ritonavir arm.\n\nAmong all randomised and treated patients, the median change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at \nthe last measurement up to Week 48 was +23 cells/mm3 in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir \n(N=740) versus +4 cells/mm3 in the comparator PI/ritonavir (N=727) arm.\n\nThe superiority of tipranavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir over the comparator protease \ninhibitor/ritonavir arm was observed for all efficacy parameters at week 48. It has not been shown that \ntipranavir is superior to these boosted comparator protease inhibitors in patients harbouring strains \nsusceptible to these protease inhibitors. RESIST data also demonstrate that tipranavir co-administered \nwith low dose ritonavir exhibits a better treatment response at 48 weeks when the OBR contains \ngenotypically available antiretroviral agents (e.g. enfuvirtide).\n\nAt present there are no results from controlled trials evaluating the effect of tipranavir on clinical \nprogression of HIV.\n\n\n\n65\n\nPaediatric population\nHIV-positive, paediatric patients, aged 2 through 18 years, were studied in a randomized, open-label, \nmulticenter study (trial 1182.14). Patients were required to have a baseline HIV-1 RNA concentration \nof at least 1500 copies/ml, were stratified by age (2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years and 12 to 18 years) \nand randomized to receive one of two tipranavir with ritonavir dose regimens: 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2\n\ndose, compared to the 290 mg/m2/115 mg/m2 dose, plus background therapy of at least two non-\nprotease inhibitor antiretroviral medicinal products, optimized using baseline genotypic resistance \ntesting. All patients initially received Aptivus oral solution. Paediatric patients who were 12 years or \nolder and received the maximum dose of 500 mg/200 mg twice daily could change to Aptivus capsules \nfrom study day 28. The trial evaluated pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, as well as virologic \nand immunologic responses through 48 weeks.   \n\nThe available clinical data do not support the use of Aptivus oral solution in adolescents or adults. \nCompared to the capsules, tipranavir exposure is higher when administering the same dose as oral \nsolution (see section 5.2). Due to this and to the high vitamin E content of the oral solution, the risk of \nadverse reactions (type, frequency and/or severity) may be higher than with the capsule formulation. \nIn patients less than 12 years of age, however, the oral solution is the only available option for \ntreatment with tipranavir, as no data are available on the efficacy and safety of Aptivus capsules in \nchildren less than 12 years of age. Since Aptivus capsules and oral solution are not bioequivalent, \nresults obtained with the oral solution cannot be extrapolated to the capsules (see also section 5.2). \nMoreover, in patients with a body surface area of less than 1.33 m\u00b2 appropriate dose adjustments \ncannot be achieved with the capsule formulation. These factors lead to the conclusion that the benefits \noutweigh the risks of Aptivus oral solution only in children between 2 and 12 years of age without any \nother therapeutic option (see section 4.1).\n\nThe baseline characteristics and the key efficacy results at 48 weeks for the paediatric patients \nreceiving Aptivus oral solution are displayed in the tables below.\n\nBaseline characteristics for patients 2 - <12 years treated with Aptivus oral solution\n\nVariable Value\nNumber of Patients 62\nAge-Median (years) 8.1\nGender % Male 59.7%\nRace % White 71.0%\n\n% Black 25.8%\n% Asian 3.2%\n\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA \n(log10 copies/ml)\n\nMedian \n(Min \u2013 Max)\n\n4.8 (3.3 \u2013 6.0)\n\n% with VL  > \n100,000 copies/ml\n\n37.1%\n\nBaseline CD4+ \n(cells/mm3)\n\nMedian\n(Min \u2013 Max)\n\n600 (24 \u2013 2578)\n\n% \u2264 200 15.5%\n\nBaseline % CD4+ cells Median \n(Min \u2013 Max)\n\n21.9% (1.5% \u2013\n44.0%)\n\nPrevious ADI* % with Category C 48.4%\nTreatment history % with any ARV 96.8%\n\nMedian # previous \nNRTIs\n\n4\n\nMedian # previous \nNNRTIs\n\n1\n\nMedian # previous \nPIs\n\n1\n\n* AIDS defining illness\n\n\n\n66\n\nKey efficacy results at 48 weeks for patients 2 - <12 years treated with Aptivus oral solution\n\nEndpoint Result\nNumber of patients 62\nPrimary efficacy endpoint: \n% with VL < 400\n\n50.0%\n\nMedian change from baseline \nin log10 HIV-1 RNA (copies/ml) \n\n-2.06\n\nMedian change from baseline \nin CD4+ cell count (cells/mm3) \n\n167\n\nMedian change from baseline \nin % CD4+ cells \n\n5%\n\nAnalyses of tipranavir resistance in treatment experienced patients\nTipranavir with ritonavir response rates in the RESIST studies were assessed by baseline tipranavir \ngenotype and phenotype.  Relationships between baseline phenotypic susceptibility to tipranavir, \nprimary PI mutations, protease mutations at codons 33, 82, 84 and 90, tipranavir resistance-associated \nmutations, and response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy were assessed.\n\nOf note, patients in the RESIST studies had a specific mutational pattern at baseline of at least one \nprimary protease gene mutation among codons 30N, 46I, 46L, 48V, 50V, 82A, 82F, 82L, 82T, 84V or \n90M, and no more than two mutations on codons 33, 82, 84 or 90.\n\nThe following observations were made:\n\n\uf02d Primary PI mutations\nAnalyses were conducted to assess virological outcome by the number of primary PI mutations (any \nchange at protease codons 30, 32, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 82, 84, 88 and 90) present at baseline. \nResponse rates were higher in tipranavir with ritonavir patients than comparator PI boosted with \nritonavir in new enfuvirtide patients, or patients without new enfuvirtide. However, without new \nenfuvirtide some patients began to lose antiviral activity between weeks 4 and 8.\n\n\uf02d Mutations at protease codons 33, 82, 84 and 90\nA reduced virological response was observed in patients with viral strains harbouring two or more \nmutations at HIV protease codons 33, 82, 84 or 90, and not receiving new enfuvirtide.\n\n\uf02d Tipranavir resistance-associated mutations\nVirological response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy has been evaluated using a tipranavir-\nassociated mutation score based on baseline genotype in RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 patients. This score \n(counting the 16 amino acids that have been associated with reduced tipranavir susceptibility and/or \nreduced viral load response: 10V, 13V, 20M/R/V, 33F, 35G, 36I, 43T, 46L, 47V, 54A/M/V, 58E, \n69K, 74P, 82L/T, 83D and 84V) was applied to baseline viral protease sequences. A correlation \nbetween the tipranavir mutation score and response to tipranavir with ritonavir therapy at week 48 has \nbeen established. \n\nThis score has been determined from the selected RESIST patient population having specific mutation \ninclusion criteria and therefore extrapolation to a wider population mandates caution.\n\nAt 48-weeks, a higher proportion of patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir achieved a treatment \nresponse in comparison to the comparator protease inhibitor/ritonavir for nearly all of the possible \ncombinations of genotypic resistance mutations (see table below).\n\n\n\n67\n\nProportion of patients achieving treatment response at Week 48 (confirmed \u22651 log10 copies/ml \ndecrease in viral load compared to baseline), according to tipranavir baseline mutation score \nand enfuvirtide use in RESIST patients\n\nNew ENF No New \nENF*\n\nNumber of \nTPV Score \nMutations**\n\nTPV/r TPV/r \n\n0,1 73% 53%\n2 61% 33%\n3 75% 27%\n4 59% 23%\n\n\u2265 5 47% 13%\nAll patients 61% 29%\n\n* Includes patients who did not receive ENF and those who were previously treated with and \ncontinued ENF\n**Mutations in HIV protease at positions L10V, I13V, K20M/R/V, L33F, E35G, M36I, K43T, M46L, \nI47V, I54A/M/V, 58E, H69K, T74P, V82L/T, N83D or I84V\nENF Enfuvirtide; TPV/r Tipranavir with ritonavir\n\nSustained HIV-1 RNA decreases up to week 48 were mainly observed in patients who received \ntipranavir with ritonavir and new enfuvirtide.

As demonstrated in a dose-\nranging evaluation in 113 HIV-negative healthy male and female volunteers, ritonavir increases AUC0-\n12h, Cmax and Cmin and decreases the clearance of tipranavir. 500 mg tipranavir co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir (200 mg; twice daily) was associated with a 29-fold increase in the geometric mean \nmorning steady-state trough plasma concentrations compared to tipranavir 500 mg twice daily without \nritonavir. \n\nAbsorption\nAbsorption of tipranavir in humans is limited, though no absolute quantification of absorption is \navailable. Tipranavir is a P-gp substrate, a weak P-gp inhibitor and appears to be a potent P-gp inducer \nas well. Data suggest that, although ritonavir is a P-gp inhibitor, the net effect of Aptivus, co-\nadministered with low dose ritonavir, at the proposed dose regimen at steady-state, is P-gp induction. \nPeak plasma concentrations are reached within 1 to 5 hours after dose administration depending upon \nthe dosage used. With repeated dosing, tipranavir plasma concentrations are lower than predicted from \nsingle dose data, presumably due to hepatic enzyme induction. Steady-state is attained in most subjects \nafter 7 days of dosing. Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, exhibits linear \npharmacokinetics at steady state.\n\nDosing with Aptivus capsules 500 mg twice daily concomitant with 200 mg ritonavir twice daily for 2 \nto 4 weeks and without meal restriction produced a mean tipranavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) \nof 94.8 \u00b1 22.8 \u00b5M for female patients (n=14) and 77.6 \u00b1 16.6 \u00b5M for male patients (n=106), \noccurring approximately 3 hours after administration. The mean steady-state trough concentration \nprior to the morning dose was 41.6 \u00b1 24.3 \u00b5M for female patients and 35.6 \u00b1 16.7 \u00b5M for male \npatients. Tipranavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged 851 \u00b1 309 \u00b5M\u2022h (CL=1.15 l/h) for \nfemale patients and 710 \u00b1 207 \u00b5M\u2022h (CL=1.27 l/h) for male patients. The mean half-life was \n5.5 (females) or 6.0 hours (males). \n\nEffects of food on oral absorption\nFood improves the tolerability of tipranavir with ritonavir. Therefore Aptivus, co-administered with \nlow dose ritonavir, should be given with food. \n\nAbsorption of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is reduced in the presence of \nantacids (see section 4.5). \n\nDistribution\nTipranavir is extensively bound to plasma proteins (>99.9%). From clinical samples of healthy \nvolunteers and HIV-1 positive subjects who received tipranavir without ritonavir the mean fraction of \ntipranavir unbound in plasma was similar in both populations (healthy volunteers 0.015% \uf0b1 0.006%; \nHIV-positive subjects 0.019% \uf0b1 0.076%). Total plasma tipranavir concentrations for these samples \nranged from 9 to 82 \uf06dM. The unbound fraction of tipranavir appeared to be independent of total \nconcentration over this concentration range.  \n\nNo studies have been conducted to determine the distribution of tipranavir into human cerebrospinal \nfluid or semen.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro metabolism studies with human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 is the predominant \nCYP isoform involved in tipranavir metabolism. \n\nThe oral clearance of tipranavir decreased after the addition of ritonavir which may represent \ndiminished first-pass clearance of the substance at the gastrointestinal tract as well as the liver. \n\n\n\n69\n\nThe metabolism of tipranavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is minimal. In a 14C-tipranavir \nhuman study (500 mg 14C-tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir, twice daily), unchanged tipranavir was \npredominant and accounted for 98.4% or greater of the total plasma radioactivity circulating at 3, 8, or \n12 hours after dosing. Only a few metabolites were found in plasma, and all were at trace levels (0.2% \nor less of the plasma radioactivity). In faeces, unchanged tipranavir represented the majority of faecal \nradioactivity (79.9% of faecal radioactivity). The most abundant faecal metabolite, at 4.9% of faecal \nradioactivity (3.2% of dose), was a hydroxyl metabolite of tipranavir. In urine, unchanged tipranavir \nwas found in trace amounts (0.5% of urine radioactivity). The most abundant urinary metabolite, at \n11.0% of urine radioactivity (0.5% of dose) was a glucuronide conjugate of tipranavir.\n\nElimination\nAdministration of 14C-tipranavir to subjects (n = 8) that received 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg \nritonavir twice daily dosed to steady-state demonstrated that most radioactivity (median 82.3%) was \nexcreted in faeces, while only a median of 4.4% of the radioactive dose administered was recovered in \nurine. In addition, most radioactivity (56%) was excreted between 24 and 96 hours after dosing. The \neffective mean elimination half-life of tipranavir with ritonavir in healthy volunteers (n = 67) and \nHIV-infected adult patients (n = 120) was approximately 4.8 and 6.0 hours, respectively, at steady \nstate following a dose of 500 mg/200 mg twice daily with a light meal. \n\nSpecial populations\nAlthough data available at this stage are currently limited to allow a definitive analysis, they suggest \nthat the pharmacokinetic profile is unchanged in older people and comparable between races. By \ncontrast, evaluation of the steady-state plasma tipranavir trough concentrations at 10-14 h after dosing \nfrom the RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 studies demonstrate that females generally had higher tipranavir \nconcentrations than males. After four weeks of Aptivus 500 mg with 200 mg ritonavir (twice daily) \nthe median plasma trough concentration of tipranavir was 43.9 \u00b5M for females and 31.1 \u00b5M for males. \nThis difference in concentrations does not warrant a dose adjustment.\n\nRenal impairment\nTipranavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However, since \nthe renal clearance of tipranavir is negligible, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in \npatients with renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn a study comparing 9 patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment to 9 controls, the single \nand multiple dose exposure of tipranavir and ritonavir were increased in patients with hepatic \nimpairment but still within the range observed in clinical studies.  No dosing adjustment is required in \npatients with mild hepatic impairment but patients should be closely monitored (see sections 4.2 and \n4.4).\n\nThe influence of moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment on the \nmultiple dose pharmacokinetics of either tipranavir or ritonavir has so far not been investigated. \nTipranavir is contraindicated in moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe oral solution has been shown to have greater bioavailability than the soft capsule formulation.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted with tipranavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs, and co-\nadministered with ritonavir (3.75:1 w/w ratio) in rats and dogs. Studies with co-administration of \ntipranavir and ritonavir did not reveal any additional toxicological effects when compared to those \nseen in the tipranavir single agent toxicological studies.\n\nThe predominant effects of repeated administration of tipranavir across all species toxicologically \ntested were on the gastrointestinal tract (emesis, soft stool, diarrhoea) and the liver (hypertrophy). The \neffects were reversible with termination of treatment. Additional changes included bleeding in rats at \n\n\n\n70\n\nhigh doses (rodents specific). Bleeding observed in rats was associated with prolonged prothrombin \ntime (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and a decrease in some vitamin K dependent \nfactors. The co-administration of tipranavir with vitamin E in the form of TPGS (d-alphatocopherol \npolyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) from 2,322 IU/m\u00b2 upwards in rats resulted in a significant \nincrease in effects on coagulation parameters, bleeding events and death. In preclinical studies of \ntipranavir in dogs, an effect on coagulation parameters was not seen. Co-administration of tipranavir \nand vitamin E has not been studied in dogs. \n\nThe majority of the effects in repeat-dose toxicity studies appeared at systemic exposure levels which \nare equivalent to or even below the human exposure levels at the recommended clinical dose. \n\nIn in vitro studies, tipranavir was found to inhibit platelet aggregation when using human platelets (see \nsection 4.4) and thromboxane A2 binding in an in vitro cell model at levels consistent with exposure \nobserved in patients receiving Aptivus with ritonavir. The clinical implications of these findings are \nnot known.\n\nIn a study conducted in rats with tipranavir at systemic exposure levels (AUC) equivalent to human \nexposure at the recommended clinical dose, no adverse effects on mating or fertility were observed. At \nmaternal doses producing systemic exposure levels similar to or below those at the recommended \nclinical dose, tipranavir did not produce teratogenic effects. At tipranavir exposures in rats at 0.8-fold \nhuman exposure at the clinical dose, foetal toxicity (decreased sternebrae ossification and body \nweights) was observed. In pre- and post-natal development studies with tipranavir in rats, growth \ninhibition of pups was observed at maternally toxic doses approximating 0.8-fold human exposure. \n\nCarcinogenicity studies of tipranavir in mice and rats revealed tumourigenic potential specific for \nthese species, which are regarded as of no clinical relevance. Tipranavir showed no evidence of \ngenetic toxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. \n\nIn Aptivus oral solution, a degradation impurity (5-trifluoro-2-methylpyridinol, 5-TFMP) may be \npresent. Highly purified 5-TFMP has been tested using the in vitro Ames bacterial reverse mutation \ntest and has shown positive results. Therefore, 5-TFMP is considered a mutagen with unknown \ncarcinogenic potential. Given the expected limited treatment duration of the oral solution the clinical \nrelevance is uncertain.\n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS\n\n6.1 List of excipients\n\nMacrogol \nVitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate\nPurified water\nPropylene glycol \nMono/diglycerides of caprylic/capric acid \nSucralose\nButter mint (flavouring)\nButter toffee (flavouring) \nAscorbic acid\n\n6.2 Incompatibilities\n\nNot applicable.\n\n6.3 Shelf life\n\n18 months.\n\n\n\n71\n\nIn use storage: 60 days, after first opening of the bottle. It is advisable that the patient writes the date \nof opening the bottle on the label and/or carton.\n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage\n\nStore between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00baC. Do not refrigerate or freeze.\n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container\n\nAmber glass bottle, with two-piece plastic child-resistant closure (outer shell high density \npolyethylene (HDPE), inner shell polypropylene resin with a foamed laminated polyethylene liner.. \nEach pack contains 1 bottle of 95 ml oral solution and is supplied with a clear polypropylene 5 ml oral \nsyringe, HDPE syringe tip cap and clear LDPE bottle-syringe adapter.\n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling\n\nBefore taking Aptivus it should be checked that the oral solution is clear and whether there are crystals \nor other particles at the bottom of the bottle. A small amount of crystals may be observed in the bottle, \nwhich does not affect the potency or safety of the product. If observed, crystals are typically seen as a \npaper-thin layer on the bottom when the bottle is stored upright. Dosing by means of the measuring \ndevice remains accurate even when crystals are observed. If there is more than a thin layer of crystals \nat the bottom of the bottle or uncertainty about the amount of crystals observed, the bottle should be \nreturned for a replacement as soon as possible. Until the bottle is exchanged the patient should \ncontinue to take the usual doses of the oral solution. Patients should be instructed to observe closely \nfor crystals. \n\nThe exact dose should be measured using the supplied measuring syringe and adapter, as follows:\n\n1. Open the bottle by pressing down on the cap and turning in an anti-clockwise direction. \n2. Remove the syringe cap covering the tip of the oral syringe (the cap will not be attached if this \n\nis the first time the oral syringe has been used) and insert the oral syringe into the adapter \nlocated in the neck of the bottle. Make sure the oral syringe is tightly inserted.\n\n3. Turn the bottle upside down and gently withdraw the required amount of Aptivus oral solution.\n4. Administer Aptivus oral solution immediately. The maximum volume which can be withdrawn \n\nat one time is 5 ml (equivalent to 500 mg tipranavir), which is the maximum single dose for a \nchild with BSA > 1.33 m2.\n\n5. After use of the oral syringe, reapply the syringe cap. \n\nNo special requirements for disposal. \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET\n\n\n\n86\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user\n\nAptivus 250 mg soft capsules\ntipranavir\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor or your pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Aptivus is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take Aptivus\n3. How to take Aptivus\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Aptivus\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\nIf Aptivus has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this leaflet is \naddressed to your child (in this case please read \u201cyour child\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d).\n\n1. What Aptivus is and what it is used for\n\nAptivus contains the active substance tipranavir. It belongs to a group of medicines called protease \ninhibitors and is used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It blocks \nan enzyme called protease that is involved in the reproduction of HIV. When the enzyme is blocked, \nthe virus does not reproduce normally, slowing down the infection. You must take Aptivus together \nwith:\n\n\uf02d low dose ritonavir (this helps Aptivus to reach a high enough level in your blood)\n\uf02d other HIV medicines. Your doctor, together with you, will decide which other medicines you \n\nshould take. This will depend on, for example:\n\uf02d which other medicines you have already taken for HIV\n\uf02d which medicines your HIV is resistant to. If your HIV is resistant to some HIV \n\nmedicines, this means that the medicine will not work so well, or will not work at all.\n\nAptivus is specifically used for the treatment of HIV which is resistant to most other protease \ninhibitors. Before starting treatment, your doctor will have taken blood samples to test the resistance \nof your HIV. These tests will have confirmed that the HIV in your blood is resistant to most other \nprotease inhibitors. Aptivus treatment is therefore appropriate for you. You should not use Aptivus if \nyou have never received antiretroviral therapy or have other antiretroviral options available.\n\nAptivus soft capsules are indicated for:\n\uf02d adolescents 12 years of age or older\n\uf02d adults\n\n\n\n87\n\n2. What you need to know before you take Aptivus\n\nYou must take Aptivus in combination with low dose ritonavir and other antiretroviral \nmedicines. It is therefore important that you know about these medicines too. You should \ntherefore carefully read the Package Leaflets of ritonavir and your other antiretroviral\nmedicines. If you have any further questions about ritonavir or the other medicines you are \nprescribed, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nDo not take Aptivus\n- if you are allergic to tipranavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6)\n- if you have moderate to severe liver problems. Your doctor will take a blood sample to test how \n\nwell your liver is working (your liver function). Depending on your liver function you may have \nto delay or stop Aptivus treatment\n\n- if you are currently taking products containing:\n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis)\n- cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)\n- pimozide or sertindole (used to treat schizophrenia)\n- quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive \n\ndisorder)\n- lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia)\n- triazolam or oral midazolam (taken by mouth). These medicines are used to treat \n\nanxiety or sleep disorders\n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches)\n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergies or hay fever)\n- simvastatin or lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)\n- amiodarone, bepridil, flecainide, propafenone or quinidine (used to treat heart \n\ndisorders)\n- metoprolol (used to treat heart failure)\n- alfuzosin and sildenafil (when used to treat a rare blood vessel disorder characterized \n\nby increased pressure in the pulmonary artery)\n- colchicine (when used to treat gout flares in patients with kidney or liver disease).\n\nDo not take products containing St John\u2019s wort (a herbal remedy for depression). This may stop \nAptivus from working properly.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Aptivus.\n\nTell your doctor if you have:\n- type A or B haemophilia\n- diabetes\n- liver disease.\n\nIf you have:\n- high liver function test results\n- hepatitis B or C infection\nyou are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver damage while taking Aptivus. Your \ndoctor will monitor your liver function by blood tests before and during Aptivus treatment. If you have \nliver disease or hepatitis, your doctor will decide if you need additional testing. You should inform \nyour doctor as soon as possible if you notice the signs or symptoms of hepatitis:\n- fever\n- malaise (feeling generally unwell)\n- nausea (upset stomach)\n- vomiting\n- abdominal pain\n- tiredness\n\n\n\n88\n\n- jaundice (yellowing of the skin or the eyeballs)\n\nAptivus is not a cure for HIV infection:\nYou should know that you may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV \ndisease. You should therefore remain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV \nwhen taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss \nwith your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nRash:\nMild to moderate rash, including:\n- hives\n- rash with flat or raised small red spots\n- sensitivity to the sun\nhave been reported in approximately 1 in 10 patients receiving Aptivus. Some patients who developed \nrash also had:\n- joint pain or stiffness\n- throat tightness\n- generalized itching\n\nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection (for example fever, enlarged lymph nodes), please inform your\ndoctor immediately.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\nTell your doctor if you experience fainting or a sensation of abnormal heart beats. Aptivus in \ncombination with low dose ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical \nactivity of your heart. These changes may be seen on an ECG (electrocardiogram).\n\nBone problems: Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease \ncalled osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your doctor.\n\nChildren\nAptivus soft capsules should not be used by children under 12 years of age.\n\nOlder people\nIf you are older than 65 years your doctor will exercise caution when prescribing Aptivus soft capsules \nto you and will closely monitor your therapy. Tipranavir has been used in limited number of patients \n65 years or older.\n\nOther medicines and Aptivus\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\n\n\n89\n\nThis is very important. If you take other medicines at the same time as Aptivus and ritonavir, this can \nstrengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines. These effects are called interactions, and can lead to \nserious side effects, or prevent proper control of other conditions you may have.\n\nInteractions with other HIV medicines:\n- etravirine belongs to a class of HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors (NNRTIs). Taking Aptivus with etravirine is not recommended.\n\n- abacavir and zidovudine. These belong to a class of HIV medicines called nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Your doctor will only prescribe you abacavir and zidovudine if \nyou are unable to take other NRTIs. \n\n- didanosine: If you are taking didanosine enteric coated tablets, you should take them at least \ntwo hours before or after Aptivus.\n\n- emtricitabine: If you are taking emtricitabine your kidney function should be checked before \ninitiation of Aptivus.\n\n- rilpivirine: If you are taking rilpivirine, your doctor will monitor you closely.\n\n- Protease Inhibitors (PIs): Taking Aptivus may cause large decreases in the blood levels of other \nHIV protease inhibitors. For example the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir \nand saquinavir will be decreased.\nTaking Aptivus, with atazanavir, may cause the blood levels of Aptivus and ritonavir to increase \na lot. \nYour doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of Aptivus and \nprotease inhibitors.\n\nOther medicines with which Aptivus may interact include:\n- oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT): If you are taking the contraceptive pill \n\nto prevent pregnancy you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. barrier \ncontraception like condoms). Generally, it is not recommended to take Aptivus, with ritonavir, \ntogether with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). You should check \nwith your doctor if you do wish to continue taking oral contraceptives or HRT. If you use oral \ncontraceptives or HRT you have an increased chance of developing a skin rash while taking \nAptivus. If a rash occurs, it is usually mild to moderate. You should talk to your doctor as you \nmay need to temporarily stop taking either Aptivus or your oral contraceptives or HRT\n\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). These may decrease the \neffectiveness of Aptivus.\n\n- sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines used to produce and maintain an erection). The effects \nof sildenafil and vardenafil are likely to be increased if you take them with Aptivus. You should \nnot be prescribed tadalafil until you have been taking Aptivus for 7 days or more.\n\n- omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitors \nused to reduce the gastric acid production)\n\n- metronidazole (used to treat infections) \n- disulfiram (used to treat alcohol dependence)\n- buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines used to treat severe pain)\n- cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus (used to prevent organ rejection (to suppress the immune \n\nsystem))\n- warfarin (used to treat and prevent thrombosis)\n- digoxin (used to treat heart arrhythmias and heart failure)\n- antifungal medications including fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or voriconazole\n\nThe following medicines are not recommended:\n- fluticasone (used to treat asthma)\n- atorvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)\n- salmeterol (used to achieve long-term asthma control, bronchospasm prevention with COPD)\n\n\n\n90\n\n- bosentan (used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension)\n- halofantrine or lumefantrine (used to treat malaria)\n- tolterodine (used to treat overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or \n\nurge incontinence))\n- boceprevir and telaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C)\n- cobicistat and products containing cobicistat (used to increase effectiveness of HIV medicines).\n\nAptivus may lead to a loss of effectiveness of some medicines including:\n- methadone, meperidine (pethidine), used as morphine substitutes\n\nYour doctor may have to increase or decrease the dose of other medicines which you take together \nwith Aptivus. Examples include:\n- rifabutin and clarithromycin (antibiotics)\n- theophylline (used to treat asthma) \n- desipramine, trazodone and bupropion (used to treat depression; bupropion is also used for \n\nsmoking cessation)\n- midazolam (when given by injection); midazolam is a sedative used to treat anxiety and to help \n\nyou sleep\n- rosuvastatin or pravastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)\n- colchicine (used to treat gout flares with normal kidney and liver function)\n- raltegravir (used to treat HIV infection)\n- dolutegravir (used to treat HIV infection).\n\nIf you take aluminium- and magnesium-based antacid (used to treat dyspepsia/gastrooesophageal \nreflux), the time interval between Aptivus and antacid should be at least two hours.\n\nTell your doctor if you receive medicines such as blood-thinning agents, or if you are taking vitamin \nE. Your doctor may wish to consider certain precautionary measures in such circumstances.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. It is not known whether Aptivus may \nbe used safely during pregnancy. You must not breast-feed your baby because it is possible that the \nbaby can become HIV-infected through the breast milk. See also Section 2, under \u201cOral \ncontraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u201d.\nAptivus contains very small amounts of alcohol (see Aptivus capsules contain ethanol). \n\nDriving and using machines\nSome of the side effects of Aptivus may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery (e.g. \ndizziness and sleepiness). If affected, you should not drive or operate machinery.\n\nAptivus capsules contain ethanol, macrogolglycerol ricinoleate and sorbitol (E420)\nAptivus contains 100 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each capsule. The amount in 250 mg of this medicine \n(i.e. one capsule) is equivalent to less than 3 ml of beer, or than 1 ml of wine. The small amount of \nalcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. \n\nAptivus also contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.\n\nThis medicine contains 12.6 mg of sorbitol in each capsule.\n\n3. How to take Aptivus\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. You must take Aptivus together with ritonavir. \n\nThe recommended dose for an adult or an adolescent 12 years and above is:\n\n\n\n91\n\n- 500 mg (two 250 mg capsules) Aptivus together with \n- 200 mg (two 100 mg capsules) ritonavir\ntwice per day with food. \n\nOral use.\nAptivus capsules should be taken with food, swallowed whole and must not be opened or chewed.\n\nAlways take this medicine in combination with other antiretroviral medicines. You should follow the \ninstructions for these medicines within the supplied Package Leaflets.\n\nYou should continue to take Aptivus for as long as your doctor tells you.\n\nIf you take more Aptivus than you should\nInform your doctor as soon as possible if you take more than the prescribed dose of Aptivus.\n\nIf you forget to take Aptivus\nIf you miss a dose of Aptivus or ritonavir by more than 5 hours, wait and then take the next dose of \nAptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If you miss a dose of Aptivus and/or ritonavir by \nless than 5 hours, take your missed dose immediately. Then take your next dose of Aptivus and \nritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you stop taking Aptivus\nIt has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times:\n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines\n- reduces the chances of your HIV becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines\n\nTherefore, it is important that you continue taking Aptivus correctly, as described above. Do NOT stop \ntaking Aptivus unless your doctor instructs you to do so.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. It may be \ndifficult to tell the difference between:\n- side effects caused by Aptivus\n- side effects caused by the other medicines you are also taking\n- complications of HIV infection.\n\nFor this reason it is very important that you tell your doctor about any changes in your health. \n\nSerious side effects associated with Aptivus:\n\n- Abnormal liver function\n- Hepatitis and fatty liver\n- Liver failure. This can lead to death \n- Increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin)\nYou should inform your doctor if you experience:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Nausea (upset stomach)\n\n\n\n92\n\n- Vomiting and/or jaundice\nwhich may be symptoms of abnormal liver function\n\n- Bleeding\n- *Bleeding in the brain. This can lead to permanent disability or death, and has \n\noccurred in some patients treated with Aptivus in clinical trials. In the majority of \nthese patients the bleeding may have had other causes. For example they had other \nmedical conditions or were receiving other medicine that may have caused the \nbleeding.\n\nPossible side effects:\n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people\n- Diarrhoea \n- Nausea (upset stomach)\n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people\n- Vomiting\n- Abdominal pain (tummy pain)\n- Flatulence (when you break wind more often)\n- Tiredness\n- Headache\n- Mild rashes e.g. with hives or with flat or raised small red spots\n- Increases in blood lipid (fat) levels\n- Dyspepsia\n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people\n- Reduction in red and white blood cells\n- Reduction in blood platelets\n- Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions\n- Decreased appetite\n- Diabetes\n- Increased blood sugar\n- Increased blood levels of cholesterol\n- Sleeplessness and other sleep disorders\n- Sleepiness\n- Dizziness\n- Numbness and/or tingling and/or pain in the feet or hands\n- Breathing difficulties\n- Heartburn\n- Inflammation of the pancreas\n- Skin inflammation\n- Itching\n\n- Muscle cramp\n- Muscle pain\n- Kidney disease\n- Flu like symptoms (feeling unwell)\n- Fever\n- Weight loss\n- Increased blood levels of the pancreas enzyme amylase\n- Increases in liver enzyme activity\n- Hepatitis with liver cell damage due to influence of a toxin\n\nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people\n- Liver failure (including fatal outcome)\n- Hepatitis\n- Fatty liver\n\n\n\n93\n\n- Increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin)\n- Dehydration (when your body does not have enough water)\n- Thinning of the face\n- Bleeding in the brain* (see above)\n- Increased blood levels of the pancreas enzyme lipase\n\nFurther information on possible side effects related to combination antiretroviral treatment:\n- Bleeding\n\n- Increased bleeding. If you have haemophilia type A and B, you may experience \nincreased bleeding. This may be in the skin or joints. If you suffer increased bleeding \nyou should see your doctor immediately. \n\nMuscle disorders \nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. These occur particularly when \nAptivus or other protease inhibitors are taken together with nucleoside analogues. Rarely these muscle \ndisorders have been serious, involving breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis).\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nThe most common side effects were generally similar to those described in adults. Vomiting, rash and \nfever were observed more frequently in children than in adults.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Aptivus\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle after EXP. The expiry date \nrefers to the last day of that month.\n\nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Once the bottle is opened the contents must be used within 60 \ndays (stored below 25\u00b0C). You should write the date of opening the bottle on the label and/or outer \ncarton. \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, please ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child\u2019s.\n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n1. What Aptivus is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Aptivus\n3. How to take Aptivus\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Aptivus\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Aptivus is and what it is used for\n\nAptivus contains the active substance tipranavir. It belongs to a group of medicines called protease \ninhibitors and is used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It blocks \nan enzyme called protease that is involved in the reproduction of HIV. When the enzyme is blocked, \nthe virus does not reproduce normally, slowing down the infection. Your child must take Aptivus\ntogether with:\n\n\uf02d low dose ritonavir (this helps Aptivus to reach a high enough level in your child\u2019s blood)\n\uf02d other HIV medicines. Your child\u2019s doctor, together with you, will decide which other medicines \n\nyour child should take. This will depend on, for example:\n\uf02d which other medicines your child has already taken for HIV\n\uf02d which medicines your child\u2019s HIV is resistant to. If your child\u2019s HIV is resistant to \n\nsome HIV medicines, this means that the medicine will not work so well, or will not \nwork at all.\n\nAptivus is specifically used for the treatment of HIV which is resistant to most other protease \ninhibitors. Before starting treatment, your child\u2019s doctor will have taken blood samples to test the \nresistance of your child\u2019s HIV. These tests will have confirmed that the HIV in your child\u2019s blood is \nresistant to most other protease inhibitors. Aptivus treatment is therefore appropriate for your child. \nYour child should not use Aptivus if they have never received antiretroviral therapy or have other \nantiretroviral options available.\n\nAptivus oral solution is indicated for:\n\uf02d children from 2 to 12 years of age \n\n\n\n98\n\n2. What you need to know before your child takes Aptivus\n\nYour child must take Aptivus in combination with low dose ritonavir and other antiretroviral \nmedicines. It is therefore important that you know about these medicines too. You should \ntherefore carefully read the Package Leaflets of ritonavir and your child\u2019s other antiretroviral\nmedicines. If you have any further questions about ritonavir or the other medicines your child is \nprescribed, please ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.\n\nDo not give Aptivus\n- if your child is allergic to tipranavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n- if your child has moderate to severe liver problems. Your child\u2019s doctor will take a blood \n\nsample to test how well your child\u2019s liver is working (your child\u2019s liver function). Depending on \nyour child\u2019s liver function they may have to delay or stop Aptivus treatment\n\n- if your child is currently taking products containing:\n- rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis)\n- cisapride (used to treat stomach problems)\n- pimozide or sertindole (used to treat schizophrenia)\n- quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive \n\ndisorder)\n- lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia)\n- triazolam or oral midazolam (taken by mouth). These medicines are used to treat \n\nanxiety or sleep disorders\n- ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches)\n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergies or hay fever)\n- simvastatin or lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)\n- amiodarone, bepridil, flecainide, propafenone or quinidine (used to treat heart \n\ndisorders)\n- metoprolol (used to treat heart failure)\n- alfuzosin and sildenafil (when used to treat a rare blood vessel disorder characterized \n\nby increased pressure in the pulmonary artery)\n- colchicine (when used to treat gout flares in patients with kidney or liver disease).\n\nYour child must not take products containing St John\u2019s wort (a herbal remedy for depression). This \nmay stop Aptivus from working properly.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist before giving Aptivus to your child.\n\nTell your child\u2019s doctor if they have:\n- type A or B haemophilia\n- diabetes\n- liver disease.\n\nIf your child has:\n- high liver function tests results\n- hepatitis B or C infection \nyour child is at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver damage while taking Aptivus. Your \nchild\u2019s doctor will monitor their liver function by blood tests before and during Aptivus treatment. If \nyour child has liver disease or hepatitis, their doctor will decide if they need additional testing. You \nshould inform your child\u2019s doctor as soon as possible if you notice your child has the signs or \nsymptoms of hepatitis:\n- fever\n- malaise (feeling generally unwell)\n- nausea (upset stomach)\n- vomiting\n- abdominal pain\n\n\n\n99\n\n- tiredness\n- jaundice (yellowing of the skin or the eyeballs)\n\nAptivus is not a cure for HIV infection:\nYou should know that your child may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated \nwith HIV disease. You should therefore remain in regular contact with your child\u2019s doctor. Your child \ncan still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your child\u2019s doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.\n\nRash:\nMild to moderate rash, including:\n- hives\n- rash with flat or raised small red spots\n- sensitivity to the sun \nhave been reported in approximately 1 in 10 patients receiving Aptivus. Some patients who developed \nrash also had:\n- joint pain or stiffness\n- throat tightness\n- generalized itching\n\nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, \nenabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection (for example fever, enlarged lymph nodes), please inform your \nchild\u2019s doctor immediately.\n\nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after your child starts taking medicines for \nthe treatment of your child\u2019s HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the \nstart of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle \nweakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, \npalpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your child\u2019s doctor immediately to seek necessary \ntreatment.\n\nTell your child\u2019s doctor if your child experiences fainting or a sensation of abnormal heart beats. \nAptivus in combination with low dose ritonavir may cause changes in your child\u2019s heart rhythm and \nthe electrical activity of your child\u2019s heart. These changes may be seen on an ECG \n(electrocardiogram).\n\nBone problems: Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease \ncalled osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of \ncombination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe \nimmunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for \ndeveloping this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the \nhip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \ninform your child\u2019s doctor.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nAptivus should neither be used by children under 2 years of age nor by adolescents 12 years of age or \nolder.\n\nAptivus oral solution contains vitamin E. Your child should not take any additional vitamin E \nsupplements.\n\n\n\n100\n\nOther medicines and Aptivus\nTell your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \nother medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.\n\nThis is very important. If your child takes other medicines at the same time as Aptivus and ritonavir, \nthis can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines. These effects are called interactions, and can \nlead to serious side effects, or prevent proper control of other conditions your child may have.\n\nInteractions with other HIV medicines:\n- etravirine belongs to a class of HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors (NNRTIs). Taking Aptivus with etravirine is not recommended.\n\n- abacavir and zidovudine. These belong to a class of HIV medicines called nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Your child\u2019s doctor will only prescribe them abacavir and \nzidovudine if they are unable to take other NRTIs. \n\n- didanosine: If your child is taking didanosine enteric coated tablets, they should take them at \nleast two hours before or after Aptivus. \n\n- emtricitabine: If your child is taking emtricitabine your child\u2019s kidney function should be \nchecked before initiation of Aptivus.\n\n- rilpivirine: If your child is taking rilpivirine, your child\u2019s doctor will monitor your child closely.\n\n- Protease Inhibitors (PIs): Taking Aptivus may cause large decreases in the blood levels of other \nHIV protease inhibitors. For example the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir \nand saquinavir will be decreased.\nTaking Aptivus, with atazanavir, may cause the blood levels of Aptivus and ritonavir to increase \na lot. \nYour child\u2019s doctor will carefully consider whether to treat them with combinations of Aptivus\nand protease inhibitors.\n\nOther medicines with which Aptivus may interact include:\n- oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT): If your child is taking the \n\ncontraceptive pill to prevent pregnancy they should use an additional or different type of \ncontraception (e.g. barrier contraception like condoms). Generally, it is not recommended to \ntake Aptivus, with ritonavir, together with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy \n(HRT). You should check with your child\u2019s doctor if they do wish to continue taking oral \ncontraceptives or HRT. If your child uses oral contraceptives or HRT they have an increased \nchance of developing a skin rash while taking Aptivus. If a rash occurs, it is usually mild to \nmoderate. You should talk to your child\u2019s doctor as they may need to temporarily stop taking \neither Aptivus or their oral contraceptives or HRT\n\n- carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). These may decrease the \neffectiveness of Aptivus.\n\n- sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines used to produce and maintain an erection). The effects \nof sildenafil and vardenafil are likely to be increased if taken with Aptivus. Tadalafil should not \nbe prescribed until Aptivus has been taken  for 7 days or more.\n\n- omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitors \nused to reduce the gastric acid production)\n\n- metronidazole (used to treat infections) \n- disulfiram (used to treat alcohol dependence)\n- buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines used to treat severe pain)\n- cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus (used to prevent organ rejection (to suppress the immune \n\nsystem))\n- warfarin (used to treat and prevent thrombosis)\n\n\n\n101\n\n- digoxin (used to treat heart arrhythmias and heart failure)\n- antifungal medications including fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or voriconazole\n\nThe following medicines are not recommended:\n- fluticasone (used to treat asthma)\n- atorvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)\n- salmeterol (used to achieve long-term asthma control, bronchospasm prevention with COPD)\n- bosentan (used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension)\n- halofantrine or lumefantrine (used to treat malaria)\n- tolterodine (used to treat overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or \n\nurge incontinence))\n- boceprevir and telaprevir (used to treat hepatitis C)\n- cobicistat and products containing cobicistat (used to increase effectiveness of HIV medicines).\n\nAptivus may lead to a loss of effectiveness of some medicines including:\n- methadone, meperidine (pethidine), used as morphine substitutes\n\nYour child\u2019s doctor may have to increase or decrease the dose of other medicines which they take \ntogether with Aptivus. Examples include:\n- rifabutin and clarithromycin (antibiotics)\n- theophylline (used to treat asthma) \n- desipramine, trazodone and bupropion (used to treat depression; bupropion is also used for \n\nsmoking cessation)\n- midazolam (when given by injection); midazolam is a sedative used to treat anxiety and to help \n\nyour child sleep\n- rosuvastatin or pravastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol)\n- colchicine (used to treat gout flares with normal kidney and liver function)\n- raltegravir (used to treat HIV infection)\n- dolutegravir (used to treat HIV infection)\n\nIf your child takes aluminium- and magnesium-based antacid (used to treat dyspepsia/ \ngastrooesophageal reflux), the time interval between Aptivus and antacid should be at least two hours.\n\nTell your child\u2019s doctor if your child receives medicines such as blood-thinning agents, or if your child \nis taking vitamin E. Your child\u2019s doctor may wish to consider certain precautionary measures in such \ncircumstances.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nIf your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, you think your child may be pregnant or is planning to have \na baby, ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist for advice before giving this medicine. It is not known \nwhether Aptivus may be used safely during pregnancy. Your child must not breast-feed the baby \nbecause it is possible that the baby can become HIV-infected through the breast milk. See also Section \n2, under \u201cOral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u201d.\n\nDriving and using machines\nSome of the side effects of Aptivus may affect your child\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery (e.g. \ndizziness and sleepiness). If affected, your child should not drive or operate machinery. \n\n3. How to take Aptivus\n\nAlways give your child this medicine exactly as the doctor has advised. Check with your child\u2019s \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your child must take Aptivus together with ritonavir. \n\nAptivus oral solution should be taken with food.\n\n\n\n102\n\nThe dose for children, aged 2 to 12 years, will be calculated by the doctor. This will be based on the \nchild\u2019s body surface area in metres squared. The dose for children should not exceed 5 ml (500 mg) \ntwice a day. Be sure your child\u2019s doctor clearly informs you what the correct dose for your child \nshould be. You should measure the exact dose using the supplied measuring syringe and adapter, as \nfollows:\n\n1. Check that the oral solution is clear (see below). \n2. Open the bottle by pressing down on the cap and turning it in an anti-clockwise direction.\n3. Remove the syringe cap covering the tip of the oral syringe (the cap will not be attached if this \n\nis the first time you are using the syringe).\n4. Insert the oral syringe into the adapter located in the neck of the bottle. Make sure the oral \n\nsyringe is tightly inserted. The maximum volume you can withdraw at one time is 5 ml \n(equivalent to 500 mg tipranavir), which is the maximum single dose for a child with BSA\n(Calculated body surface area) > 1.33 m2\n\n5. Turn the bottle upside down and gently withdraw the required amount of Aptivus oral solution.\n6. Gently empty Aptivus oral solution from the syringe into your child\u2019s mouth.\n7. After use of the oral syringe, replace the syringe cap.\n\nBefore giving Aptivus you should check that the oral solution is clear. Crystals may be seen as a \npaper-thin layer at the bottom of the bottle when it is stored upright. There may be other particles at \nthe bottom of the bottle. A small amount of crystals does not affect the strength or safety of your \nchild\u2019s medicine.  \n\nYou should return the bottle to your child\u2019s pharmacist or doctor for a replacement as soon as possible \nif:\n- there is more than a thin layer of crystals at the bottom of the bottle, or\n- you are uncertain about the amount of crystals you see or\n- any other particles are visible. \nUntil you exchange the bottle, please continue to give your child their usual doses of Aptivus oral \nsolution.\n\nYour child will always have to take Aptivus in combination with other antiretroviral medicines. You \nshould follow the instructions for these medicines within the supplied Package Leaflets.\n\nYour child should continue to take Aptivus for as long as your child\u2019s doctor tells him/her. At the age \nof 12 years, children treated with Aptivus should be switched from the oral solution to the capsules.\n\nIf your child takes more Aptivus than he/she should\nInform your child\u2019s doctor as soon as possible if they take more than the prescribed dose of Aptivus.\n\nIf your child forgets to take Aptivus\nIf your child misses a dose of Aptivus or ritonavir by more than 5 hours, wait and then give the next \ndose of Aptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time. If your child misses a dose of Aptivus\nand/or ritonavir by less than 5 hours, give the missed dose immediately. Then give the next dose of \nAptivus and ritonavir at the regularly scheduled time.\n\nDo not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf your child stops taking Aptivus\nIt has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times:\n- greatly increases the effectiveness of your child\u2019s combination antiretroviral medicines\n- reduces the chances of your child\u2019s HIV becoming resistant to his/her antiretroviral medicines. \n\nTherefore, it is important that your child continues taking Aptivus correctly, as described above. Your \nchild must NOT stop taking Aptivus unless your child\u2019s doctor instructs to do so.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.\n\n\n\n103\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves. Your child\u2019s doctor will test for these changes.\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. It may be \ndifficult to tell the difference between:\n- side effects caused by Aptivus\n- side effects caused by the other medicines your child is also taking\n- complications of HIV infection. \n\nFor this reason it is very important that you tell your child\u2019s doctor about any changes in their health. \n\nSerious side effects associated with Aptivus:\n\n- Abnormal liver function\n- Hepatitis and fatty liver \n- Liver failure. This can lead to death \n- Increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin)\nYou should inform your child\u2019s doctor if they experience:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Nausea (upset stomach)\n- Vomiting and/or jaundice\nwhich may be symptoms of abnormal liver function\n\n- Bleeding\n- * Bleeding in the brain. This can lead to permanent disability or death, and has \n\noccurred in some patients treated with Aptivus in clinical trials. In the majority of \nthese patients the bleeding may have had other causes. For example they had other \nmedical conditions or were receiving other medicine that may have caused the \nbleeding.\n\nPossible side effects:\n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people\n- Diarrhoea \n- Nausea (upset stomach)\n\nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people\n- Vomiting\n- Abdominal pain (tummy pain)\n- Flatulence (breaking wind more often)\n- Tiredness\n- Headache\n- Mild rashes e.g. with hives or with flat or raised small red spots\n- Increases in blood lipid (fat) levels\n- Dyspepsia\n\nUncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people\n- Reduction in red and white blood cells\n- Reduction in blood platelets\n- Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions\n- Decreased appetite\n- Diabetes\n- Increased blood sugar\n\n\n\n104\n\n- Increased blood levels of cholesterol\n- Sleeplessness and other sleep disorders\n- Sleepiness\n- Dizziness\n- Numbness and/or tingling and/or pain in the feet or hands\n- Breathing difficulties\n- Heartburn\n- Inflammation of the pancreas\n- Skin inflammation\n- Itching\n- Muscle cramp\n- Muscle pain\n- Kidney disease\n- Flu like symptoms (feeling unwell)\n- Fever\n- Weight loss\n- Increased blood levels of the pancreas enzyme amylase\n- Increases in liver enzyme activity\n- Hepatitis with liver cell damage due to influence of a toxin\n\nRare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people\n- Liver failure (including fatal outcome)\n- Hepatitis\n- Fatty liver\n- Increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin)\n- Dehydration (when the body does not have enough water)\n- Thinning of the face\n- Bleeding in the brain* (see above)\n- Increased blood levels of the pancreas enzyme lipase\n\nFurther information on possible side effects related to combination antiretroviral treatment:\n- Bleeding\n\n- Increased bleeding. If your child has haemophilia type A and B, they may experience \nincreased bleeding. This may be in the skin or joints. If your child suffers increased \nbleeding you should see your child\u2019s doctor immediately. \n\nMuscle disorders \nThere have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. These occur particularly when \nAptivus or other protease inhibitors are taken together with nucleoside analogues. Rarely these muscle \ndisorders have been serious, involving breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis).\n\nAdditional side effects in children and adolescents\nThe most common side effects were generally similar to those described in adults. Vomiting, rash and \nfever were observed more frequently in children than in adults.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf your child gets any side effects, please talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national \n\nreporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more \n\ninformation on the safety of this medicine.\n\n5. How to store Aptivus\n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n105\n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle after EXP.

protease inhibitors and is used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. it blocks an enzyme called protease that is involved in the reproduction of hiv. when the enzyme is blocked, the virus does not reproduce normally, slowing down the infection. you must take aptivus together with: low dose ritonavir (this helps aptivus to reach a high enough level in your blood) other hiv medicines. your doctor, together with you, will decide which other medicines you should take. this will depend on, for example: which other medicines you have already taken for hiv which medicines your hiv is resistant to. if your hiv is resistant to some hiv medicines, this means that the medicine will not work so well, or will not work at all. aptivus is specifically used for the treatment of hiv which is resistant to most other protease inhibitors. before starting treatment, your doctor will have taken blood samples to test the resistance of your hiv. these tests will have confirmed that the hiv in your blood is resistant to most other protease inhibitors. aptivus treatment is therefore appropriate for you. you should not use aptivus if you have never received antiretroviral therapy or have other antiretroviral options available. aptivus soft capsules are indicated for: adolescents 12 years of age or older adults 87", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text":

aptivus treatment - if you are currently taking products containing: - rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) - cisapride (used to treat stomach problems) - pimozide or sertindole (used to treat schizophrenia) - quetiapine (used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder) - lurasidone (used to treat schizophrenia) - triazolam or oral midazolam (taken by mouth). these medicines are used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders - ergot derivatives (used to treat headaches) - astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat allergies or hay fever) - simvastatin or lovastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) - amiodarone, bepridil, flecainide, propafenone or quinidine (used to treat heart disorders) - metoprolol (used to treat heart failure) - alfuzosin and sildenafil (when used to treat a rare blood vessel disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary artery) - colchicine (when used to treat gout flares in patients with kidney or liver disease). do not take products containing st john's wort (a herbal remedy for depression). this may stop aptivus from working properly. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking aptivus. tell your doctor if you have: - type a or b haemophilia - diabetes - liver disease. if you have: - high liver function test results - hepatitis b or c infection you are at increased risk of severe and potentially fatal liver damage while taking aptivus. your doctor will monitor your liver function by blood tests before and during aptivus treatment. if you have liver disease or hepatitis, your doctor will decide if you need additional testing. you should inform your doctor as soon as possible if you notice the signs or symptoms of hepatitis: - fever - malaise (feeling generally unwell) - nausea (upset stomach) - vomiting - abdominal pain - tiredness 88 - jaundice (yellowing of the skin or the eyeballs) aptivus is not a cure for hiv infection: you should know that you may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with hiv disease. you should therefore remain in regular contact with your doctor. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. rash: mild to moderate rash, including: - hives - rash with flat or raised small red spots - sensitivity to the sun have been reported in approximately 1 in 10 patients receiving aptivus. some patients who developed rash also had: - joint pain or stiffness - throat tightness - generalized itching in some patients with advanced hiv infection (aids) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example fever, enlarged lymph nodes), please inform your doctor immediately. in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. tell your doctor if you experience fainting or a sensation of abnormal heart beats. aptivus in combination with low dose ritonavir may cause changes in your heart rhythm and the electrical activity of your heart. these changes may be seen on an ecg (electrocardiogram). bone problems: some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. children aptivus soft capsules should not be used by children under 12 years of age. older people if you are older than 65 years your doctor will exercise caution when prescribing aptivus soft capsules to you and will closely monitor your therapy. tipranavir has been used in limited number of patients 65 years or older. other medicines and aptivus tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. this is very important. if you take other medicines at the same time as aptivus and ritonavir, this can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines. these effects are called interactions, and can lead to serious side effects, or prevent proper control of other conditions you may have. interactions with other hiv medicines: - etravirine belongs to a class of hiv medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis). taking aptivus with etravirine is not recommended. - abacavir and zidovudine. these belong to a class of hiv medicines called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis). your doctor will only prescribe you abacavir and zidovudine if you are unable to take other nrtis. - didanosine: if you are taking didanosine enteric coated tablets, you should take them at least two hours before or after aptivus. - emtricitabine: if you are taking emtricitabine your kidney function should be checked before initiation of aptivus. - rilpivirine: if you are taking rilpivirine, your doctor will monitor you closely. - protease inhibitors (pis): taking aptivus may cause large decreases in the blood levels of other hiv protease inhibitors. for example the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir and saquinavir will be decreased. taking aptivus, with atazanavir, may cause the blood levels of aptivus and ritonavir to increase a lot. your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of aptivus and protease inhibitors. other medicines with which aptivus may interact include: - oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (hrt): if you are taking the contraceptive pill to prevent pregnancy you should use an additional or different type of contraception (e.g. barrier contraception like condoms). generally, it is not recommended to take aptivus, with ritonavir, together with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (hrt). you should check with your doctor if you do wish to continue taking oral contraceptives or hrt. if you use oral contraceptives or hrt you have an increased chance of developing a skin rash while taking aptivus. if a rash occurs, it is usually mild to moderate. you should talk to your doctor as you may need to temporarily stop taking either aptivus or your oral contraceptives or hrt - carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (used to treat epilepsy). these may decrease the effectiveness of aptivus. - sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (medicines used to produce and maintain an erection). the effects of sildenafil and vardenafil are likely to be increased if you take them with aptivus. you should not be prescribed tadalafil until you have been taking aptivus for 7 days or more. - omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitors used to reduce the gastric acid production) - metronidazole (used to treat infections) - disulfiram (used to treat alcohol dependence) - buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines used to treat severe pain) - cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus (used to prevent organ rejection (to suppress the immune system)) - warfarin (used to treat and prevent thrombosis) - digoxin (used to treat heart arrhythmias and heart failure) - antifungal medications including fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole or voriconazole the following medicines are not recommended: - fluticasone (used to treat asthma) - atorvastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) - salmeterol (used to achieve long-term asthma control, bronchospasm prevention with copd) 90 - bosentan (used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension) - halofantrine or lumefantrine (used to treat malaria) - tolterodine (used to treat overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence)) - boceprevir and telaprevir (used to treat hepatitis c) - cobicistat and products containing cobicistat (used to increase effectiveness of hiv medicines). aptivus may lead to a loss of effectiveness of some medicines including: - methadone, meperidine (pethidine), used as morphine substitutes your doctor may have to increase or decrease the dose of other medicines which you take together with aptivus. examples include: - rifabutin and clarithromycin (antibiotics) - theophylline (used to treat asthma) - desipramine, trazodone and bupropion (used to treat depression; bupropion is also used for smoking cessation) - midazolam (when given by injection); midazolam is a sedative used to treat anxiety and to help you sleep - rosuvastatin or pravastatin (used to lower blood cholesterol) - colchicine (used to treat gout flares with normal kidney and liver function) - raltegravir (used to treat hiv infection) - dolutegravir (used to treat hiv infection). if you take aluminium- and magnesium-based antacid (used to treat dyspepsia/gastrooesophageal reflux), the time interval between aptivus and antacid should be at least two hours. tell your doctor if you receive medicines such as blood-thinning agents, or if you are taking vitamin e. your doctor may wish to consider certain precautionary measures in such circumstances. pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. it is not known whether aptivus may be used safely during pregnancy. you must not breast-feed your baby because it is possible that the baby can become hiv-infected through the breast milk. see also section 2, under \"oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (hrt)\". aptivus contains very small amounts of alcohol (see aptivus capsules contain ethanol). driving and using machines some of the side effects of aptivus may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery (e.g. dizziness and sleepiness). if affected, you should not drive or operate machinery. aptivus capsules contain ethanol, macrogolglycerol ricinoleate and sorbitol (e420) aptivus contains 100 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each capsule. the amount in 250 mg of this medicine (i.e. one capsule) is equivalent to less than 3 ml of beer, or than 1 ml of wine. the small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. aptivus also contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea. this medicine contains 12.6 mg of sorbitol in each capsule.",

caused by aptivus - side effects caused by the other medicines you are also taking - complications of hiv infection. for this reason it is very important that you tell your doctor about any changes in your health. serious side effects associated with aptivus: - abnormal liver function - hepatitis and fatty liver - liver failure. this can lead to death - increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin) you should inform your doctor if you experience: - loss of appetite - nausea (upset stomach) 92 - vomiting and/or jaundice which may be symptoms of abnormal liver function - bleeding - *bleeding in the brain. this can lead to permanent disability or death, and has occurred in some patients treated with aptivus in clinical trials. in the majority of these patients the bleeding may have had other causes. for example they had other medical conditions or were receiving other medicine that may have caused the bleeding. possible side effects: very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people - diarrhoea - nausea (upset stomach) common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people - vomiting - abdominal pain (tummy pain) - flatulence (when you break wind more often) - tiredness - headache - mild rashes e.g. with hives or with flat or raised small red spots - increases in blood lipid (fat) levels - dyspepsia uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people - reduction in red and white blood cells - reduction in blood platelets - allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions - decreased appetite - diabetes - increased blood sugar - increased blood levels of cholesterol - sleeplessness and other sleep disorders - sleepiness - dizziness - numbness and/or tingling and/or pain in the feet or hands - breathing difficulties - heartburn - inflammation of the pancreas - skin inflammation - itching - muscle cramp - muscle pain - kidney disease - flu like symptoms (feeling unwell) - fever - weight loss - increased blood levels of the pancreas enzyme amylase - increases in liver enzyme activity - hepatitis with liver cell damage due to influence of a toxin rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people - liver failure (including fatal outcome) - hepatitis - fatty liver 93 - increased blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of haemoglobin) - dehydration (when your body does not have enough water) - thinning of the face - bleeding in the brain* (see above) - increased blood levels of the pancreas enzyme lipase further information on possible side effects related to combination antiretroviral treatment: - bleeding - increased bleeding. if you have haemophilia type a and b, you may experience increased bleeding. this may be in the skin or joints. if you suffer increased bleeding you should see your doctor immediately. muscle disorders there have been reports of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. these occur particularly when aptivus or other protease inhibitors are taken together with nucleoside analogues. rarely these muscle disorders have been serious, involving breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). additional side effects in children and adolescents the most common side effects were generally similar to those described in adults. vomiting, rash and fever were observed more frequently in children than in adults. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, please talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this
