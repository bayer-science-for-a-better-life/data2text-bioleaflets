NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nQuadramet 1.3 GBq/mL solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 1.3 GBq Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam pentasodium at the reference date \n(corresponding to 20 to 80 µg/ml of samarium per vial) \n \nSamarium specific activity is approximately 16 – 65 MBq/µg of samarium. \n \nEach vial contains 2-4 GBq at the reference date. \n \nSamarium-153 emits both medium-energy beta particles and an imageable gamma photon, and has a \nperiod of 46.3 hours (1.93 days). The primary radiation emissions of samarium-153 are shown in \nTable 1. \n \n\nTABLE 1 : SAMARIUM-153 PRINCIPAL RADIATION EMISSION DATA \n\nRadiation Energy (keV)* Abundance \n\nBeta 640 30% \n\nBeta 710 50% \n\nBeta 810 20% \n\nGamma 103 29% \n\n* Maximum energies are listed for the beta emissions, the average beta particle energy is \n233 keV. \n\n \nExcipient with known effect: sodium 8.1 mg/mL. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless to light amber solution with pH ranging between 7.0 and 8.5. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nQuadramet is indicated for the relief of bone pain in patients with multiple painful osteoblastic skeletal \nmetastases which take up technetium (99mTc)-labelled biphosphonates on bone scan. \n \nThe presence of osteoblastic metastases which take up technetium (99mTc)-labelled biphosphonates \nshould be confirmed prior to therapy. \n \n\n\n\n 3\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nQuadramet should only be administered by physicians experienced in the use of radiopharmaceuticals \nand after full oncological evaluation of the patient by qualified physicians. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose of Quadramet is 37 MBq per kg body weight. \n \nPaediatric population \nQuadramet is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 years due to a lack of data on \nsafety and efficacy. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nQuadramet is to be administered by slow intravenous route through an established intravenous line \nover a period of one minute. Quadramet should not be diluted before use. \n \nPatients who respond to Quadramet generally experience the onset of pain relief within 1 week after \ntreatment. Relief of pain may persist for 4 weeks up to 4 months. Patients who experience a reduction \nin pain may be encouraged to decrease their use of opioid analgesics. \n \nRepeat administration of Quadramet should be based on an individual patient's response to prior \ntreatment and on clinical symptoms. A minimum interval of 8 weeks should be respected, subject to \nrecovery of adequate bone marrow function. \n \nThe data on the safety of repeated dosing are limited and based on compassionate use of the product. \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance (ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate (EDTMP) \n\nor similar phosphonates) or to any of the excipients excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• in pregnant women (See section 4.6). \n• in patients having received chemotherapy or hemi-body external radiation therapy in a \n\npreceding period of 6 weeks. \n \nQuadramet is used only as a palliative agent and should not be used concurrently with myelotoxic \nchemotherapy as this may enhance myelotoxicity. \n \nIt should not be used concurrently with other biphosphonates if an interference is shown on the \ntechnetium (99mTc)-labelled biphosphonate bone scans. \n \n\n\n\n 4\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn absence of clinical data, the injected activity should be adapted to the renal function. \n \nUse of Quadramet in patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve from previous \ntherapy or disease involvement is not recommended unless the potential benefit of the treatment \noutweighs its risks. \n \nBecause of potential bone marrow suppression after administration, blood counts should be monitored \nweekly for at least 8 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after administration of Quadramet, or until recovery of \nadequate bone marrow function. \n \nThe patient should be encouraged to ingest (or receive by intravenous administration) a minimum of \n500 ml of fluids prior to injection and should be encouraged to void as often as possible after injection \nto minimise radiation exposure to the bladder. \n \nThe clearance of Quadramet being rapid, the precautions relating to the excreted urinary radioactivity \nneed not be taken after 6-12 hours following administration. \n \nSpecial precautions, such as bladder catheterisation, should be taken during six hours following \nadministration to incontinent patients to minimise the risk of radioactive contamination of clothing, \nbed linen, and the patient's environment. For the other patients the urine should be collected for at least \nsix (6) hours. \n \nBladder catheterisation should be undertaken in patients with urinary obstruction. \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \ndesignated clinical settings. Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations \nand the appropriate licences of the local competent official organisations. \nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety \nand pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying \nwith the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice for pharmaceuticals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBecause of the potential for additive effects on bone marrow, the treatment should not be given \nconcurrently with chemotherapy or external beam radiation therapy. Quadramet may be given \nsubsequent to either of these treatments after allowing for adequate marrow recovery. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nQuadramet is contra-indicated (see 4.3) in pregnancy. The possibility of pregnancy must strictly be \nruled out. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during the treatment \nand the whole period of follow-up. \n \nBreast-feeding \nThere are no available clinical data relating to the excretion of Quadramet in human milk. If therefore \nQuadramet administration is deemed necessary, formula feeding should be substituted for breast-\nfeeding and the expressed feeds discarded. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n\n\n\n 5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nDecreases in white blood cell and platelet counts and anaemia were observed in patients receiving \nQuadramet. \nIn clinical trials white blood cell and platelet counts decreased to a nadir of approximately 40 % to \n50 % of baseline 3 to 5 weeks after a dose, and generally returned to pre-treatment levels by 8 weeks \npost treatment.  \n \nThe few patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 hematopoietic toxicity usually either had a history of \nrecent external beam radiation therapy or chemotherapy or had rapidly progressive disease with \nprobable bone marrow involvement. \n \nPostmarketing reports of thrombocytopenia have included isolated reports of intracranial \nhaemorrhage, and cases in which the outcome was fatal. \n \nA small number of patients have reported a transient increase in bone pain shortly after injection (flare \nreaction). This is usually mild and self-limiting and occurs within 72 hours of injection. Such reactions \nare usually responsive to analgesics. \n \nAdverse drug reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sweating were reported. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported after \nQuadramet administration. \n \nA few patients experienced cord/root compressions, disseminated intravascular coagulation and \ncerebrovascular accidents. The occurrence of these events may be linked to the patients’ disease \nevolution. When there are spinal metastases at the cervico-dorsal level, an increased risk of spinal cord \ncompression cannot be excluded. \n \nThe radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and \nmutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the \ndisease itself. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe product should only be administered by qualified personnel in authorised settings. The possibility \nof pharmacological overdose is therefore remote. \n \nThe risks to be expected are associated with the inadvertent administration of excess radioactivity. \nRadiation dose to the body can be limited by promoting a diuresis and frequent voiding of urine. \n \n \n\n\n\n 6\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGIC PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Various pain palliation radiopharmaceuticals. \nATC Code: V10BX02 \n \nMechanism of action \nQuadramet has an affinity for skeletal tissue and concentrates in areas of bone turnover in intimate \nassociation with hydroxyapatite. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nStudies in rats have demonstrated that Quadramet is cleared rapidly from the blood and localises to \ngrowing areas of bone matrix, specifically the layer of osteoid undergoing mineralisation. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nIn clinical studies employing planar imaging techniques, Quadramet accumulates with a lesion-to-\nnormal bone ratio of approximately 5 and a lesion-to-soft tissue ratio of approximately 6. Thus, areas \nof metastatic involvement can accumulate significantly greater amounts of Quadramet than \nsurrounding normal bone. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nTotal skeletal uptake of Quadramet in studies of 453 patients with a variety of primary malignancies \nwas 65.5 ± 15.5 % of the administered activity. A positive correlation was found between skeletal \nuptake and the number of metastatic sites. In contrast, skeletal uptake was inversely proportional to \nplasma radioactivity at 30 minutes. \n \nElimination \nIn patients, Quadramet is rapidly cleared from the blood. Thirty minutes after injection of the agent to \n22 patients, only 9.6 ± 2.8 % of the administered activity remained in plasma. At 4 and 24 hours, \nplasma radioactivity had decreased from 1.3 ± 0.7 % to 0.05 ± 0.03 %. \n \nUrinary excretion occurred predominantly during the first 4 hours (30.3 ± 13.5 %). At 12 hours, \n35.3 ± 13.6 % of the administered activity had been excreted into the urine. Less urinary excretion \noccurred in patients who had extensive bony metastases, regardless of the amount of \nradiopharmaceutical administered. \n \nBiotransformation \nAnalysis of urine samples found the radioactivity to be present as the intact complex \n \n\n\n\n 7\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe radiolysis products of Sm-EDTMP showed a renal toxicity in rats and dogs with a no effect level \nof 2.5 mg/kg. \n \nRepeated dose administration of samarium (153Sm)-EDTMP to dogs indicated a slightly longer time \nfor depressed bone marrow and peripheral haematological parameters to recover when compared to \nrecovery following only single dose administration. \n \nRadioactive Sm-EDTMP has not been tested for mutagenicity/carcinogenicity but due to the radiation \ndose resulting from therapeutic exposure it should be regarded as presenting a genotoxic/carcinogenic \nrisk. \n \nNon-radioactive Sm-EDTMP showed no mutagenic potential in a battery of in vivo and in vitro tests. \nThe same results were observed for Sm-EDTMP enriched with radiolysis degradants. \n \nIn a carcinogenic potential study of EDTMP, osteosarcomas occurred in rats at high doses. In the \nabsence of genotoxic properties, these effects can be assigned to the EDTMP chelatant properties \nleading to osseous metabolism disturbances. \n \nNo studies have been performed to assess the effect of Quadramet on reproduction. \n \n \n6.

DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \n \n \n \n11. DOSIMETRY \n \nThe estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average adult patient from an intravenous injection of \nQuadramet are shown in Table 2. The dosimetry estimates were based on clinical biodistribution \nstudies using methods developed for radiation dose calculations by the Medical Internal Radiation \nDose (MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. \n \nBecause Quadramet is excreted in the urine, radiation exposure was based on a urinary voiding \ninterval of 4.8 hours. Radiation dose estimates for bone and marrow assume that radioactivity is \ndeposited on bone surfaces, in accordance with autoradiograms of bone samples taken from patients \nwho received Quadramet. \n \n\n\n\n 9\n\nRadiation dose to specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy, may be influenced \nsignificantly by pathophysiological changes induced by the disease process. This should be taken into \nconsideration when using the following information:  \n \n\nTABLE 2 : RADIATION ABSORBED DOSES \n\nOrgan Absorbed dose per injected activity (mGy/MBq) \n\nAdrenals 0.009 \n\nBrain 0.011 \n\nChest 0.003 \n\nGallbladder 0.004 \n\nAscending colon wall 0.005 \n\nDescending colon wall 0.010 \n\nSmall intestine 0.006 \n\nMyocardial wall 0.005 \n\nKidneys 0.018 \n\nLiver 0.005 \n\nLungs 0.008 \n\nMuscle 0.007 \n\nOvaries 0.008 \n\nPancreas 0.005 \n\nRed marrow 1.54 \n\nBone surfaces 6.76 \n\nSkin 0.004 \n\nSpleen 0.004 \n\nStomach 0.004 \n\nTestes 0.005 \n\nThymus 0.004 \n\nThyroid 0.007 \n\nUrinary bladder wall 0.973 \n\nUterus 0.011 \n\nEffective dose  \n(mSv/MBq) \n\n0.307 \n\n \nFor this product the effective dose resulting from an injected activity of 2 590 MBq is 796 mSv. \n \nFor an administered activity of 2 590 MBq, the typical radiation dose to the target organ, skeletal \nmetastases, is 86.5 Gy and the typical radiation doses to the critical organs are: normal bone surfaces \n17.5 Gy, red marrow 4.0 Gy, urinary bladder wall 2.5 Gy, kidneys 0.047 Gy and ovaries 0.021 Gy. \n \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n12.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n\n \n \n\nQuadramet 1.3 GBq/mL solution for injection \nSamarium (153Sm) lexidronam pentasodium. \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Quadramet is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Quadramet \n3. How to take Quadramet \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Quadramet \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Quadramet is and what it is used for \n \nQuadramet is a medicinal product for therapeutic use only. \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical is used for the treatment of bone pain due to your disease. \n \nQuadramet has a high affinity for skeletal tissue. Once injected it concentrates in bone lesions. \nBecause Quadramet contains small amounts of a radioactive element, samarium-153, radiations are \ndelivered locally to the bone lesions, allowing to develop the palliative action on bone pain. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Quadramet \n \nDo not take Quadramet: \n• If you are allergic to ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP) or similar \nphosphonate compounds or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6), \n• If you are pregnant, \n• If you have received chemotherapy or hemibody field external radiation therapy in a preceding \nperiod of 6 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Quadramet. \n \nYour doctor will take blood samples weekly for at least 8 weeks to check your platelets, white and red \nblood cell counts which may slightly decrease due to the therapy. \n \nDuring 6 hours following the injection of Quadramet, your physician will encourage you to drink and \nvoid as often as possible. He will decide at which time you will be authorised to leave the nuclear \nmedicine department. \n \nIn the case of urine incontinence or urinary obstruction you will get a urine catheter for about 6 hours. \nFor the other patients the urine should be collected for at least 6 hours. \n \nIf your renal function is decreased, the amount of product will be adapted. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nQuadramet is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines  and Quadramet \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding: \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nQuadramet must not be administered to pregnant women. \nIf Quadramet administration to a breastfeeding woman is deemed necessary, breastfeeding should be \nstopped. \n \n \n3. How to take Quadramet \n \nYour doctor will want to carry out a special scan before administering Quadramet to ascertain whether \nyou are likely to benefit from Quadramet. \n \nDosage \nOne single dose of 37 megabecquerel (Becquerel is the unit in which radioactivity is measured) of \nQuadramet per kilogram of body weight is to be injected. \n\nIf you have the impression that the effect of Quadramet is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor \nor pharmacist. \n\nMethod and route of administration \nQuadramet is to be administered by slow injection into a vein. \n\nFrequency of administration \nThis medicinal product is not intended to be injected on a regular or continuous basis. The \nadministration can however be repeated after 8 weeks following injection, subject to the evolution of \nyour disease. \n\nDuration of treatment \nYou will be authorised to leave the nuclear medicine department after a dosimetric follow-up \n(generally within 6 hours following Quadramet injection). \n\nIf you take more Quadramet than you should \nQuadramet being supplied as a single-dose vial, an accidental overdose is unlikely to occur. \nRadiation dose to the body can be limited by increasing fluid intake and frequent voiding of urine. \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe undesirable effects due to Quadramet administration are linked with a decrease of red and white \nblood cells, and platelets. Cases of bleeding have been reported, some of which have been serious. \n \nThis is the reason why your blood counts will be monitored strictly for a few weeks following \nQuadramet injection. \n \nYou may exceptionally feel a slight increase in bone pain a few days after Quadramet injection. You \nshould not be alarmed at this; in such case, your pain medicine will be slightly increased. This effect is \nmoderate and brief and will disappear after some hours. \n \nAdverse drug reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sweating were reported. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported after \nQuadramet administration. \n \nIn rare cases, the following undesirable effects have been observed: neuralgia, coagulation disorders, \ncerebrovascular accidents. These effects were deemed to be related to the progression of the disease. \n \nIf you experience back pain or sensory abnormalities, please inform your physician as soon as \npossible. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Quadramet \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use Quadramet after the expiry date which is stated on the label. \nQuadramet expires 1 day from the activity reference time stated on the label. \n \nStore at –10°C to –20°C in a freezer in its original packaging. \n \nQuadramet should be used within 6 hours of thawing. After thawing, do not freeze again. \n \nThe product label includes the appropriate storage conditions and the expiry date for the batch of \nproduct. Hospital personnel will ensure that the product is stored correctly and not administered to you \nafter the stated expiry date. \n \nStorage procedures should be in accordance with national regulations for radioactive materials. \n \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n6.
