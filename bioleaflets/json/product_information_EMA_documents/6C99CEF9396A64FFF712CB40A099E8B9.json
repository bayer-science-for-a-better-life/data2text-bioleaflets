NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKarvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach tablet contains 26.65 mg of lactose (as lactose monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nPeach, biconvex, oval-shaped, with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2775 engraved on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nKarvezide can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nirbesartan 300 mg or by Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n Karvezide 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nKarvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Karvezide may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial Populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Karvezide is not recommended for patients with severe \nrenal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this \n\n\n\n 3 \n\npopulation. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal \ncreatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nKarvezide is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with \ncaution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n \nNo dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nKarvezide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n The concomitant use of Karvezide with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Karvezide has been rarely associated with symptomatic \nhypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic \nhypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous \ndiuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected \nbefore initiating therapy with Karvezide. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Karvezide, a similar effect should be \nanticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Karvezide is used in patients with impaired renal \nfunction, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Karvezide in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. Karvezide should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Karvezide in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Karvezide is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Karvezide, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Karvezide hyperkalaemia \nmight occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. \nAdequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered \ncautiously with Karvezide (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Karvezide may be increased with the \nconcomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior \ntreatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when \ninitiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is \ncorrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Karvezide. Therefore, the \ncombination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Karvezide is administered with medicinal products affected by \nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Karvezide should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these \nmedications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Karvezide contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Karvezide during breast-feeding, Karvezide \nis not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Karvezide during breast feeding is not \nrecommended. If Karvezide is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Karvezide is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated \n\ncases of renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Karvezide. Tables 2 and 3 below detail the \nadverse reactions reported with the individual components of Karvezide. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\n \nImmune system disorders: \n\n \nNot known: \n\n \nAnaphylactic reaction including \nanaphylactic shock \n\n \n \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, \nphotosensitivity reactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: Fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (incl cysts and \npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Karvezide. The patient should \nbe closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends \non the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of \nemesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum \nelectrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should \nbe placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n  \nKarvezide is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, \nhydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, \nreducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \n\n\n\n 12 \n\ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of \nKarvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office \nvisits were 68% and 76% for Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg and Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-\n8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Karvezide, rebound hypertension has not \nbeen seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Karvezide, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Karvezide as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP \n≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, \nparallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\n\n\n\n 13 \n\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Karvezide, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% \nand 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the \nbioavailability of Karvezide. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration \nfor irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \n\nLinearity/non-linearityIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose \nrange of 10 to 600 mg. A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg \nwas observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and \n3.0-3.5 ml/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-\nstate plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. \nLimited accumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In \na study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive \npatients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide:  \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan:  \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide:  \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nKarvezide can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nirbesartan 300 mg or by Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n Karvezide 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nKarvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Karvezide may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Karvezide is not recommended for patients with severe \nrenal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this \n\n\n\n 19 \n\npopulation. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal \ncreatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nKarvezide is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with \ncaution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n \nNo dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nKarvezide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of Administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n The concomitant use of Karvezide with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Karvezide has been rarely associated with symptomatic \nhypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic \nhypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous \ndiuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected \nbefore initiating therapy with Karvezide. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Karvezide, a similar effect should be \nanticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Karvezide is used in patients with impaired renal \nfunction, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Karvezide in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. Karvezide should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Karvezide in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Karvezide is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Karvezide, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Karvezide hyperkalaemia \nmight occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. \nAdequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered \ncautiously with Karvezide (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Karvezide may be increased with the \nconcomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to \n300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior \ntreatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when \ninitiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is \ncorrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Karvezide. Therefore, the \ncombination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Karvezide is administered with medicinal products affected by \nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Karvezide should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these \nmedications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Karvezide contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Karvezide during breast-feeding, Karvezide \nis not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Karvezide during breast feeding is not \nrecommended. If Karvezide is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Karvezide is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Karvezide. The patient should \nbe closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends \non the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of \nemesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum \nelectrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should \nbe placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKarvezide is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, \nhydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, \nreducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \n\n\n\n 28 \n\nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of \nKarvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office \nvisits were 68% and 76% for Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg and Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-\n8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Karvezide, rebound hypertension has not \nbeen seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Karvezide, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of non-black patients. \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Karvezide as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP \n≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, \nparallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Karvezide, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% \nand 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the \nbioavailability of Karvezide. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration \nfor irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide  \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan  \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nKarvezide can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nirbesartan 300 mg or by Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n Karvezide 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nKarvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Karvezide may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Karvezide is not recommended for patients with severe \nrenal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this \n\n\n\n 35 \n\npopulation. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal \ncreatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nKarvezide is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with \ncaution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n \nNo dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nKarvezide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n The concomitant use Karvezide with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients \n\nwith diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Karvezide has been rarely associated with symptomatic \nhypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic \nhypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous \ndiuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected \nbefore initiating therapy with Karvezide. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Karvezide, a similar effect should be \nanticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Karvezide is used in patients with impaired renal \nfunction, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Karvezide in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. Karvezide should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Karvezide in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Karvezide is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Karvezide, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Karvezide hyperkalaemia \nmight occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. \nAdequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered \ncautiously with Karvezide (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n \n\n\n\n 38 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Karvezide may be increased with the \nconcomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to \n300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior \ntreatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when \ninitiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is \ncorrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Karvezide. Therefore, the \ncombination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Karvezide is administered with medicinal products affected by \nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Karvezide should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these \nmedications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Karvezide contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Karvezide during breast-feeding, Karvezide \nis not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Karvezide during breast feeding is not \nrecommended. If Karvezide is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Karvezide is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Karvezide. Tables 2 and 3 below detail the \nadverse reactions reported with the individual components of Karvezide. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic \nshock \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (incl cysts and \npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Karvezide. The patient should \nbe closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends \non the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of \nemesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum \nelectrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should \nbe placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKarvezide is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, \nhydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, \nreducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \n\n\n\n 44 \n\ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of \nKarvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office \nvisits were 68% and 76% for Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg and Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-\n8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Karvezide, rebound hypertension has not \nbeen seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Karvezide, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Karvezide as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP \n≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, \nparallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \n\n\n\n 45 \n\nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Karvezide, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% \nand 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the \nbioavailability of Karvezide. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration \nfor irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n 47 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\n \nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nKarvezide can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nirbesartan 300 mg or by Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n Karvezide 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nKarvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Karvezide may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Karvezide is not recommended for patients with severe \nrenal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this \n\n\n\n 51 \n\npopulation. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal \ncreatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nKarvezide is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with \ncaution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n \nNo dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nKarvezide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n The concomitant use of Karvezide with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Karvezide has been rarely associated with symptomatic \nhypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic \nhypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous \ndiuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected \nbefore initiating therapy with Karvezide. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Karvezide, a similar effect should be \nanticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Karvezide is used in patients with impaired renal \nfunction, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Karvezide in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. Karvezide should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n\n\n\n 52 \n\n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Karvezide in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Karvezide is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Karvezide, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Karvezide hyperkalaemia \nmight occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. \nAdequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered \ncautiously with Karvezide (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 53 \n\n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Karvezide may be increased with the \nconcomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to \n300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior \ntreatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when \ninitiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is \ncorrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Karvezide. Therefore, the \ncombination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Karvezide is administered with medicinal products affected by \nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Karvezide should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these \nmedications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n 56 \n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Karvezide contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Karvezide during breast-feeding, Karvezide \nis not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Karvezide during breast feeding is not \nrecommended. If Karvezide is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 57 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Karvezide is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachines. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \n\n\n\n 58 \n\nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Karvezide. Tables 2 and 3 below detail the \nadverse reactions reported with the individual components of Karvezide. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic \nshock \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (incl cysts and \npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Karvezide. The patient should \nbe closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends \non the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of \nemesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum \nelectrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should \nbe placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKarvezide is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, \nhydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, \nreducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \n\n\n\n 60 \n\ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of \nKarvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office \nvisits were 68% and 76% for Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg and Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-\n8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Karvezide, rebound hypertension has not \nbeen seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Karvezide, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Karvezide as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP \n≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, \nparallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n\n\n\n 62 \n\n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Karvezide, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% \nand 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the \nbioavailability of Karvezide. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration \nfor irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n 63 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nKarvezide can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not \n\nadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg alone; \n Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nirbesartan 300 mg or by Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n Karvezide 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients insufficiently controlled by \n\nKarvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Karvezide may be administered with another antihypertensive medicinal product (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Karvezide is not recommended for patients with severe \nrenal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides in this \n\n\n\n 67 \n\npopulation. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment whose renal \ncreatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \n Karvezide is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with \ncaution in patients with impaired hepatic function. No dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in \npatients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nOlder people \n \nNo dosage adjustment of Karvezide is necessary in older people. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nKarvezide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy \nhave not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \n\nother sulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n The concomitant use of Karvezide with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in \n\npatients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n<60 ml/min/1.73 m²) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Karvezide has been rarely associated with symptomatic \nhypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for hypotension. Symptomatic \nhypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous \ndiuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected \nbefore initiating therapy with Karvezide. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Karvezide, a similar effect should be \nanticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Karvezide is used in patients with impaired renal \nfunction, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Karvezide in patients with a recent kidney \ntransplantation. Karvezide should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n\n\n\n 68 \n\n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): there is evidence that the \nconcomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of \nhypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual \nblockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual blockade therapy is \nconsidered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to \nfrequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and \nangiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic \nnephropathy. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Karvezide in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Karvezide is not recommended. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Karvezide, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Karvezide hyperkalaemia \nmight occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. \nAdequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended. Potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts substitutes should be co-administered \ncautiously with Karvezide (see section 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see Section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or \nischemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \n \nAcute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide \nderivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma. While hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma have been reported so far with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset \nof decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. \nUntreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to \ndiscontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be \nconsidered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-\nclosure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy (see section 4.8). \n \nLactose: patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Karvezide may be increased with the \nconcomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to \n\n\n\n 70 \n\n300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic blockers. Prior \ntreatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when \ninitiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless the volume depletion is \ncorrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Karvezide. Therefore, the \ncombination of lithium and Karvezide is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves \nnecessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Karvezide is administered with medicinal products affected by \nserum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins. Karvezide should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these \nmedications; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nCarbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with \nthe risk of symptomatic hyponatraemia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. If \npossible, another class of diuretics should be used; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \n\n\n\n 72 \n\nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfoetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \npreeclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nSince Karvezide contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs): \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Karvezide during breast-feeding, Karvezide \nis not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-\nfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \n \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of Karvezide during breast feeding is not \nrecommended. If Karvezide is used during breast feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n 73 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBased on its pharmacodynamic properties, Karvezide is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachine. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nAmong 898 hypertensive patients who received various doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n(range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25 mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 29.5% of the patients \nexperienced adverse reactions. The most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), fatigue \n(4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in \nthe trials. \n \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials. \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports \nInvestigations: Common: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \n\ncreatinine and creatine kinase \nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \nNervous system disorders: Common: dizziness \n\nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \nNot known: headache \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Common: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Common: abnormal urination \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity \nNot known: arthralgia, myalgia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Uncommon: \nNot known: \n\njaundice \nhepatitis, abnormal liver function \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Karvezide. Tables 2 and 3 below detail the \nadverse reactions reported with the individual components of Karvezide. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: thrombocytopenia  \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: Anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic \nshock \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, acute \nmyopia and secondary acute angle-closure \nglaucoma \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (incl cysts and \npolyps) \n\nNot known: non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell \ncarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) \n\n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose \ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \n\n\n\n 75 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Karvezide. The patient should \nbe closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends \non the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of \nemesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum \nelectrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should \nbe placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nKarvezide is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, \nhydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, \nreducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of \nKarvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff during office \nvisits were 68% and 76% for Karvezide 150 mg/12.5 mg and Karvezide 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. \nThese 24-hour effects were observed without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are \nconsistent with safe and effective blood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 6-\n8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Karvezide, rebound hypertension has not \nbeen seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Karvezide, regardless of age or gender. As is the case with other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black hypertensive patients have notably \nless response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low \ndose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in black patients \napproaches that of non-black patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nEfficacy and safety of Karvezide as initial therapy for severe hypertension (defined as SeDBP \n≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 8-week, \nparallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \n\n\n\n 77 \n\nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of \ncardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of \nend-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer:  \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dosedependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n \n\n\n\n 78 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nAbsorption \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Karvezide, the absolute oral bioavailability is 60-80% \nand 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does not affect the \nbioavailability of Karvezide. Peak plasma concentration occurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration \nfor irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in older subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the terminal \nhalf-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in older people. The mean \nplasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.  \n \nElimination \n \nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or \nintravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, \nand the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged \nirbesartan. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least \n61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the \nplacental but not the blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters \nof irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. In patients with \ncreatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was reported to \nincrease to 21 hours. \n\n\n\n 79 \n\n \nHepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not \nsignificantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nThe potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination after oral administration was \nevaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to 6 months. There were no toxicological findings \nobserved of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan \n \nThere was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In \nnon-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in \nmacaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). \nAt very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys (such as interstitial \nnephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and \ncreatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the \nhypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, \nirbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in \nmacaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the \npharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \n \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \n \nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at \noral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including \nmortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live \nfoetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. \nStudies in animals indicate that the radiolabelled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit foetuses. \nIrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide \n \nAlthough equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in some experimental \nmodels, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association \nbetween its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Karvezide is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Karvezide \n3. How to take Karvezide \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Karvezide \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Karvezide is and what it is used for \n \nKarvezide is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-\nII is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. \nThis results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these \nreceptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Karvezide work together to lower blood pressure further than if either \nwas given alone. \n \nKarvezide is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or \nhydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Karvezide \n \nDo not take Karvezide \n if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Karvezide in early \n\npregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Karvezide and if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \no aliskiren. \n\n if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun \nexposure and UV rays while taking Karvezide. \n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Karvezide”. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Karvezide is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n if you are on a low-salt diet \n if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Karvezide) \n\n if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking \n\nKarvezide. This could be a sign that you are developing glaucoma, increased pressure in your \neye(s). You should discontinue Karvezide treatment and seek medical attention. \n\n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKarvezide should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Karvezide \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Karvezide may have an effect on other \nmedicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with Karvezide without close \nsupervision by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n\n\n\n 104 \n\n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take \nKarvezide” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n some laxatives \n medicines for the treatment of gout \n therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n medicines to control heart rhythm \n medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins) \n carbamazepine (a medicine for the treatment of epilepsy). \n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers, arthritis medicines, or colestyramine and colestipol \nresins for lowering blood cholesterol. \n \nKarvezide with food and drink \nKarvezide can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Karvezide, if you drink alcohol while on treatment with \nthis medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, specially when getting \nup from a sitting position. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Karvezide before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Karvezide. Karvezide is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.

What you need to know before you take Karvezide \n3. How to take Karvezide \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Karvezide \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Karvezide is and what it is used for \n \nKarvezide is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-\nII is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. \nThis results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these \nreceptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Karvezide work together to lower blood pressure further than if either \nwas given alone. \n \nKarvezide is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or \nhydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Karvezide \n \nDo not take Karvezide \n if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Karvezide in early \n\npregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Karvezide and if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n\n\n\n 117 \n\n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \no aliskiren. \n\n if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun \nexposure and UV rays while taking Karvezide. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Karvezide”. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Karvezide is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n if you are on a low-salt diet \n if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Karvezide) \n\n if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics  \n if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking \n\nKarvezide. This could be a sign that you are developing glaucoma, increased pressure in your \neye(s). You should discontinue Karvezide treatment and seek medical attention. \n\n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKarvezide should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Karvezide \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Karvezide may have an effect on other \nmedicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with Karvezide without close \nsupervision by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take \nKarvezide” and “Warnings and precautions”). \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n\n\n\n 118 \n\n potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n some laxatives \n medicines for the treatment of gout \n therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n medicines to control heart rhythm \n medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins)  \n carbamazepine (a medicine for the treatment of epilepsy). \n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers, arthritis medicines, or colestyramine and colestipol \nresins for lowering blood cholesterol. \n \nKarvezide with food and drink \nKarvezide can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Karvezide, if you drink alcohol while on treatment with \nthis medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, specially when getting \nup from a sitting position. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Karvezide before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Karvezide. Karvezide is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Karvezide is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nKarvezide is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your \ndoctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nKarvezide contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \nsome sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3. How to take Karvezide \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nDosage \nThe recommended dose of Karvezide is one or two tablets a day. Karvezide will usually be prescribed \nby your doctor when your previous treatment did not reduce your blood pressure enough. Your doctor \nwill instruct you how to switch from the previous treatment to Karvezide. \n \nMethod of administration \nKarvezide is for oral use. Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of \nwater). You can take Karvezide with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same \ntime each day. It is important that you continue to take Karvezide until your doctor tells you otherwise. \n \nThe maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 6-8 weeks after beginning treatment. \n\n\n\n 119 \n\n \nIf you take more Karvezide than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren should not take Karvezide \nKarvezide should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, \ncontact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Karvezide \nIf you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to \nmake up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

You may need to read it again. \n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What you need to know before you take Karvezide \n3. How to take Karvezide \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Karvezide \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Karvezide is and what it is used for \n \nKarvezide is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-\nII is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. \nThis results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these \nreceptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Karvezide work together to lower blood pressure further than if either \nwas given alone. \n \nKarvezide is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with irbesartan or \nhydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Karvezide \n \nDo not take Karvezide \n if you are allergic to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n if you are allergic  to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived medicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Karvezide in early \n\npregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \n\nlowering medicine containing aliskiren.  \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before taking Karvezide and if any of the following apply to you: \n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n\n\n\n 124 \n\n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n if you are taking  any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \no an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \n\ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \no aliskiren. \n\n if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase the \nrisk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin from sun \nexposure and UV rays while taking Karvezide. \n\n \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n \nSee also information under the heading “Do not take Karvezide”. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Karvezide is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n if you are on a low-salt diet \n if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Karvezide) \n\n if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics  \n if you have changes in your vision or pain in one or both of your eyes while taking \n\nKarvezide. This could be a sign that you are developing glaucoma, increased pressure in your \neye(s). You should discontinue Karvezide treatment and seek medical attention. \n\n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nKarvezide should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nOther medicines and Karvezide \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Karvezide may have an effect on other \nmedicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with Karvezide without close \nsupervision by your doctor. \n \nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: \n If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take \nKarvezide” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n\n\n\n 125 \n\n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n some laxatives \n medicines for the treatment of gout \n therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n medicines to control heart rhythm \n medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins)  \n carbamazepine (a medicine for the treatment of epilepsy). \n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers, arthritis medicines, or colestyramine and colestipol \nresins for lowering blood cholesterol. \n \nKarvezide with food and drink \nKarvezide can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Karvezide, if you drink alcohol while on treatment with \nthis medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, specially when getting \nup from a sitting position. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Karvezide before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Karvezide. Karvezide is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Karvezide is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nKarvezide is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness \nor weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your \ndoctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nKarvezide contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to \nsome sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. \n \n \n3.

Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \nDosage \nThe recommended dose of Karvezide is one tablet a day. Karvezide will usually be prescribed by your \ndoctor when your previous treatment did not reduce your blood pressure enough.

Swallow the tablets with a sufficient amount of fluid (e.g. one glass of \nwater). You can take Karvezide with or without food. Try to take your daily dose at about the same \ntime each day. It is important that you continue to take Karvezide until your doctor tells you otherwise. \n \n\n\n\n 126 \n\nThe maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 6-8 weeks after beginning treatment. \n \nIf you take more Karvezide than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nChildren should not take Karvezide \nKarvezide should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, \ncontact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Karvezide \nIf you accidentally miss a daily dose, just take the next dose as normal.
