This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRhokiinsa 200 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 200 micrograms netarsudil (as mesylate). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: \n \nEach ml of solution contains 150 micrograms benzalkonium chloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEye drops, solution (eye drops). \n \nClear solution, pH 5 (approximately). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRhokiinsa is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with \nprimary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Rhokiinsa should only be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional \nqualified in ophthalmology. \n \nPosology \n \nUse in adults, including the elderly  \nThe recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Patients should \nnot instill more than one drop in the affected eye(s) each day. \n \nIf one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose in the evening.   \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Rhokiinsa in children below the age of 18 years have not been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor ocular use. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nNo data on potential interactions specific to netarsudil is currently available (see section 4.5). If \nnetarsudil is to be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic medicinal products, each \nmedicinal product should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart. Due to netarsudil’s \nvasodilating properties, other eye drops should be administered before. Eye ointments should be \nadministered last. \n \nContact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of netarsudil and may be reinserted 15 minutes \nfollowing its administration (see section 4.4).  \n \nThe tip of the dispensing container should avoid contacting the eye, surrounding structures, fingers, or \nany other surface in order to avoid contamination of the solution. Serious damage to the eye and \nsubsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOcular effects \n \nTwice a day dosing is not well tolerated and is not recommended. Netarsudil dosed twice daily \nprovided slightly larger IOP reductions, but had a less favorable safety profile as reflected in a higher \nrate and increased severity of ocular adverse reactions. Twice a day dosing was also associated with a \nhigher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions (53.8%) during a 12-month study. It is therefore \nrecommended to dose netarsudil once daily.  \n \nBenzalkonium chloride content \n \nThis medicinal product contains benzalkonium chloride. \nBenzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause eye irritation, symptoms of dry eyes and may affect \nthe tear film and corneal surface and is known to discolour soft contact lenses. It should be used with \ncaution in dry eye patients and in patients where the cornea may be compromised.  \nPatients should be monitored in case of prolonged use. \n \nThe efficacy of netarsudil has not been studied beyond 12 months. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of netarsudil in pregnant women. No effects \nduring pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2). \nAnimal studies with intravenous administration do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with \nrespect to reproductive toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (see section 5.3). Rhokiinsa should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \nnetarsudil. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether netarsudil/metabolites are excreted in human milk. However, while no effects \non the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast-feeding women \nto netarsudil is expected to be negligible, no relevant clinical data are available (see section 5.2). A \n\n\n\n4 \n\ndecision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Rhokiinsa \ntherapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the \nwoman.  \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of netarsudil on male or female fertility. However, no effects are \nanticipated, since systemic exposure to netarsudil is negligible (see section 5.2). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRhokiinsa has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \nIf transient blurred vision occurs at instillation, the patient should wait until the vision clears before \ndriving or using machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common ocular adverse reaction observed is conjunctival hyperemia which was reported in \n51% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions reported are: cornea verticillata (17%), instillation site \npain (17%), and conjunctival haemorrhage (8%). Instillation site erythema (8%), corneal staining \n(7%), blurred vision (6%), increased lacrimation (6%) and erythema of eyelid (5%) were also \nreported.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with netarsudil, dosed once daily. Reactions are \nclassified according to the convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) or not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). \n \nSystem Organ Classification Frequency Adverse reactions \nImmune system disorders Uncommon hypersensitivity \nNervous system disorders Common headache \n Uncommon dizziness,  \n\nvisual field defect \nEye disorders Very \n\ncommon \nconjunctival hyperaemia1,  \ncornea verticillata1,  \ninstillation site pain \n\n Common conjunctival haemorrhage,  \nvision blurred,  \nlacrimation increased,  \nerythema of eyelid,  \neye pruritis,  \neye irritation,  \nvisual acuity reduced,  \neyelid oedema,  \npunctate keratitis,  \nconjunctival oedema,  \nforeign body sensation in eyes, \nconjunctivitis,  \nconjunctivitis allergic,  \nphotophobia,  \neyelid pruritus,  \neye pain,  \ncorneal opacity,  \ndry eye,  \neye discharge,  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSystem Organ Classification Frequency Adverse reactions \ninstillation site erythema,  \ninstillation site discomfort,  \ninstillation site pruritis,  \nvital dye staining cornea present, \nintraocular pressure increased \n\n Uncommon ocular hyperaemia,  \nblepharitis,  \ncorneal disorder,  \neyelid margin crusting,  \neye allergy,  \nconjunctival follicles,  \nocular discomfort,  \neye swelling,  \ncorneal deposits,  \neyelid disorder,  \nmeibomian gland dysfuntion,  \ncorneal pigmentation,  \ndiplopia,  \nectropion,  \nlenticular opacities,  \nnoninfective conjunctivitis,  \nabnormal sensation in the eye,  \nasthenopia,  \nepiscleral hyperaemia,  \nhalo vision,  \nkeratitis,  \nrefraction disorder,  \nanterior chamber flare,  \nanterior chamber inflammation,  \nblindness,  \nconjunctival irritation,  \nconjunctivochalasis,  \ndiabetic retinopathy,  \neczema eyelids,  \neyelid skin dryness,  \nglaucoma,  \ngrowth of eyelashes,  \niris adhesions,  \niris bombe,  \niritis,  \nocular hypertension,  \nvisual impairment,  \ncorneal dystrophy,  \ninstillation site foreign body sensation, \ninstillation site irritation,  \nglassy eyes,  \nfatigue,  \ninstillation site dryness,  \ninstillation site oedema,  \ninstillation site paraesthesia,  \nconjunctival staining,  \noptic nerve cup/disc ratio increased, \nmadarosis \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Uncommon nasal discomfort,  \nrhinalgia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon dermatitis allergic,  \ndermatitis contact,  \nlichenification,  \npetechiae \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon polychondritis \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Uncommon excoriation \n1 See Description of selected adverse reactions for further information \n\n\n\n6 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nConjunctival Hyperaemia \nConjunctival hyperaemia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction associated with netarsudil \ntreatment in clinical trials and it is attributed to the vasodilation effect of the Rho kinase inhibitor drug \nclass. Conjunctival hyperaemia was typically mild in severity and sporadic. However, there was a \nrelatively small proportion of subjects with moderate or severe hyperaemia who discontinued \ntreatment because of this adverse reaction (6.0% in Phase 3 clinical studies). \n \nCornea Verticillata \nCornea verticillata occurred in approximately 20% of the patients in controlled Phase 3 clinical \nstudies. The cornea verticillata seen in netarsudil-treated patients were first noted at 4 weeks of daily \ndosing. This reaction did not result in any apparent visual functional changes in patients. The majority \nof cornea verticillata resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of cornea verticillata \nwas higher in certain subpopulations: elderly (≥65 years) versus non-elderly (24.8 vs. 15.9%); males \nversus females (24.4 vs. 18.4%) and in white versus other races (25.6 vs. 7.0%). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly subjects \nWith the exception of cornea verticillata (see above), no difference in the safety profile for Rhokiinsa \nhas been observed between subjects aged <65 or ≥65 years. \n  \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSystemic exposure to netarsudil following topical ocular administration has been shown to be \nnegligible. If topical overdose of netarsudil should occur, the eye(s) may be flushed with tap water. \nTreatment of an overdose would include supportive and symptomatic therapy. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antiglaucoma preparations and miotics, ATC code: \nS01EX05 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nNetarsudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, is believed to reduce IOP by increasing outflow of aqueous humor. \nStudies in animal and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased trabecular outflow. \nThese studies also suggest that netarsudil lowers IOP by reducing episcleral venous pressure.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nA randomised, double-blind, multicentre Phase 3 clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of \nnetarsudil once daily with that of timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily in reducing IOP in a total of 708 \npatients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The median age of study participants was \n65.5 years (range 18 to 91 years).  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe study was designed to show non-inferiority of netarsudil when dosed once daily in the evening to \ntimolol maleate 0.5% dosed twice daily in patients with a baseline IOP of >20 mmHg and <25 mmHg. \nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was mean IOP at each of 9 timepoints measured at 08:00, \n10:00 and 16:00 on day 15, day 43 and day 90. The non-inferiority margin applied was a difference in \nmean IOP ≤1.5 mmHg for all time points over all visits through 3 months and ≤1.0 mmHg at a \nmajority of these time points. The IOP reduction with netarsudil dosed once daily was non-inferior to \nthe effect of timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily in patients with baseline IOP of <25 mmHg (Table 1).  \nEfficacy was also investigated in patients with baseline IOP ≥25 mmHg and <30 mmHg. Netarsudil \ndemonstrated clinically relevant reductions in IOP at all timepoints, however non-inferiority to timolol \nwas not demonstrated in this population with baseline IOP ≥25 mmHg and <30 mmHg (Table 2). \n  \nTable 1: Mean IOP by visit: PP population with baseline IOP <25 mmHg \n\nStudy Visit and Time \nPoint \n\nNetarsudil 0.02% Once \ndaily \n\nTimolol 0.5% twice daily Difference (95% CI)  \nNetarsudil – Timolol \n\nN IOP N IOP  \nBaseline 08:00 186 22.40 186 22.44  \n\n10:00 186 21.06 186 21.27  \n16:00 186 20.69 186 20.69 \n\nDay 15 08:00 184 17.68 183 17.51 0.17 (-0.43, 0.77) \n10:00 181 16.55 183 16.71 -0.16 (-0.73, 0.41) \n16:00 181 16.32 183 16.92 -0.60 (-1.16, -0.04) \n\nDay 43 08:00 177 17.84 183 17.60 0.25 (-0.34, 0.83) \n10:00 177 16.75 182 16.98 -0.22 (-0.82, 0.37) \n16:00 176 16.57 182 16.67 -0.10 (-0.66, 0.46) \n\nDay 90 08:00 167 17.86 179 17.29 0.56 (-0.02, 1.15) \n10:00 166 16.90 179 16.69 0.21 (-0.37, 0.79) \n16:00 165 16.73 179 16.80 -0.07 (-0.68, 0.55) \n\n \nTable 2: Mean IOP by visit: PP population with baseline IOP ≥25 and <30 mmHg \n\nStudy Visit and Time \nPoint \n\nNetarsudil 0.02% Once \ndaily \n\nTimolol 0.5% twice daily Difference (95% CI)  \nNetarsudil – Timolol \n\nN IOP N IOP  \nBaseline 08:00 120 26.30 130 25.96  \n\n10:00 120 25.18 130 24.91  \n16:00 120 24.48 130 23.99 \n\nDay 15 08:00 118 21.57 129 20.15 1.42 (0.51, 2.34) \n10:00 116 20.09 129 19.34 0.75 (-0.15, 1.64) \n16:00 116 20.01 129 19.17 0.83 (0.00, 1.67) \n\nDay 43 08:00 112 21.99 127 19.84 2.14 (1.16, 3.13) \n10:00 109 20.33 127 19.19 1.15 (0.30, 1.99) \n16:00 109 20.03 127 19.63 0.41 (-0.47, 1.29) \n\nDay 90 08:00 94 21.71 121 19.91 1.79 (0.74, 2.85) \n10:00 93 20.80 120 18.95 1.85 (0.89, 2.81) \n16:00 93 20.31 120 18.94 1.37 (0.46, 2.28) \n\n \nThe safety of netarsudil has been evaluated in clinical studies, including four well-controlled Phase 3 \nstudies.   \n \nApproximately 75% of subjects included in the netarsudil treatment groups of Phase 3 studies were \nCaucasian and 24% Black or African American.  Over half were aged ≥ 65 years.  With the exception \nof the incidence of cornea verticillata, no other difference in safety profile was observed between races \nor age groups (see section 4.8). \n \nCompletion rates in Phase 3 studies were lower in the netarsudil treatment group when compared with \nthe timolol maleate group. Subjects with known contraindications or hypersensitivity to timolol were \n\n\n\n8 \n\nexcluded from the studies. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 19.3% for the \nnetarsudil treatment group versus 1.7% for the timolol maleate group. The majority of \ndiscontinuations in the netarsudil group were associated with ocular adverse reactions, whereas the \nmajority of discontinuations in the timolol group were associated with non-ocular adverse reactions. \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in the Rhokiinsa \ngroups were conjunctival hyperemia (5.8%), cornea verticillata (3.7%) and vision blurred (1.4%). The \nincidences of hyperemia and vision blurred were sporadic in nature.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of netarsudil in subjects with compromised corneal epithelium or co-existing \nocular pathologies e.g. pseudoexfoliation and dispersion pigment syndrome has not been established. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nRhokiinsa in all subsets of the paediatric population for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure \nin patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe systemic exposures of netarsudil and its active metabolite, AR-13503, were evaluated in 18 \nhealthy subjects after topical ocular administration of netarsudil once daily (one drop bilaterally in the \nmorning) for 8 days. There were no quantifiable plasma concentrations of netarsudil (lower limit of \nquantitation (LLOQ) 0.100 ng/ml) post dose on day 1 and day 8. Only one plasma concentration at \n0.11 ng/ml for the active metabolite was observed for one subject on day 8 at 8 hours post-dose. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nAfter topical ocular dosing, netarsudil is metabolised by esterases in the eye to an active metabolite, \nAR-13503. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to development.  \nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n \nIntravenous administration of netarsudil mesylate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis \ndid not produce adverse embryofetal effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures. In pregnant rats, \n0.3 mg/kg/day (1000 times the recommended ophthalmic dose) and higher showed increased post-\nimplantation loss and reduced foetal viability.  In pregnant rabbits, 3 mg/kg/day (10000 times the \nrecommended ophthalmic dose) and higher showed an increase in post-implantation loss and a \ndecrease in foetal weight. \n \nLong-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of \nnetarsudil. \n \nNetarsudil was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay, in a mouse lymphoma assay, or in a rat \nmicronucleus test. \n \nNetarsudil and its active metabolite AR-13503 was found to have a possible phototoxic potential in a \nmodified 3T3 NRU-PT in vitro assay, where the wavelength was extended to include UVB light. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n19 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nRhokiinsa 200 micrograms/ml eye drops, solution \nnetarsudil  \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Rhokiinsa is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Rhokiinsa  \n3. How to use Rhokiinsa  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Rhokiinsa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Rhokiinsa is and what it is used for \n \nRhokiinsa contains an active substance called netarsudil. Netarsudil belongs to a group of medicines \ncalled “Rho kinase inhibitors”, which work to reduce the amount of fluid inside the eye and so lower \nits pressure.  \n \nRhokiinsa is used to lower pressure in the eyes in adults who have an eye condition known as \nglaucoma or who have raised pressure in their eyes. If the pressure in the eye is too high, it can \ndamage your sight. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Rhokiinsa  \n \nDo not use Rhokiinsa: \n- if you are allergic to netarsudil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\n• Do not use Rhokiinsa more than once a day, as you may experience more side effects. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nRhokiinsa should not be used in children and teenagers under 18 years of age as it has only been \nstudied in adults.  \n \nOther medicines and Rhokiinsa \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Rhokiinsa if you are \npregnant unless your doctor still recommends it. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may find that your vision is blurred or abnormal just after using Rhokiinsa. Do not drive or use \nmachines until the symptoms are cleared. \n \nRhokiinsa contains benzalkonium chloride \nThis medicine contains approximately 150 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each ml of solution.   \n \nBenzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may change the colour of the \ncontact lenses. You should remove contact lenses before using this medicine and put them back 15 \nminutes afterwards.   \n \nBenzalkonium chloride may also cause eye irritation, especially if you have dry eyes or disorders of \nthe cornea (the clear layer at the front of the eye).  If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain \nin the eye after using this medicine, talk to your doctor. \n \n \n3. How to use Rhokiinsa \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nOnly use Rhokiinsa for your eyes (ocular use). Do not swallow or inject.  \n \nThe recommended dose is one drop in the affected eye or eyes once a day in the evening. Use the \nmedicine at around the same time each day. \n \nHow to use \n \n\n \n \n• Wash your hands before you start. \n• Do not touch the dropper with your fingers when opening or closing the bottle. It could infect \n\nthe drops. \n• Twist off the bottle cap, and lie the cap on a clean surface on its side. Continue to hold the \n\nbottle, ensuring that the tip doesn’t come into contact with anything.  \n• Hold the bottle, pointing down, between your thumb and fingers. \n• Tilt your head back. \n• Pull down your lower eyelid with a clean finger to form a ‘pocket’ between the eyelid and your \n\neye. The drop will go in here (Picture 1). \n• Bring the bottle tip close to the eye. Do this in front of a mirror if it helps. \n• Do not touch your eye, eyelid, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper. It could \n\ninfect the drops. \n• Gently squeeze the bottle to release one drop of Rhokiinsa into your eye. \n• Only put one drop into your eye each time. If a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n• If you need to use the drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye while you have \nthe bottle open. \n\n• Put back the bottle cap to close the bottle. \n \nIf you are using other eye drops, wait at least five minutes after using them and then use Rhokiinsa. \nIf you are using eye ointments, these should be used last. \n  \nIf you use more Rhokiinsa than you should  \nRinse your eye with warm water. Do not put in any more drops until it is time for your next regular \ndose.  \n \nIf you forget to use Rhokiinsa \nContinue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  \nDo not use more than one drop in the affected eye(s) once a day.  \n \nIf you stop using Rhokiinsa \nDo not stop using Rhokiinsa without first speaking to your doctor. If you stop using Rhokiinsa the \npressure in your eye will not be controlled which could lead to loss of sight.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThe following side effects have been observed with Rhokiinsa: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n• Effects in the eye: Eye redness; fine deposits on the front of the eye and pain where the drops \n\nhave been put in  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• Effects in the eye: Infection or inflammation of the eye; dryness of the eye or small breaks in the \n\nfilm of liquid on the surface of the eye; eye discharge; itchy eyelids; clouding of the eye and \nvision may decrease somewhat; eye pain; feeling of grittiness or having something in the eye; \ngeneral eye redness shortly after drops are put in; spots or patches of eye redness; eye \ninflammation caused by an allergic reaction or prominent blood vessels; eyes can become \nwatery, sensitive to light; swelling around the eye; blurred vision  \n\n• General side effects: Headache \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• Effects in the eye: Increased fluid pressure inside the eye; inflammation of the coloured part of \n\nthe eye (the iris); bulging of iris; growth of eyelashes; eyelid dryness; eye disease related to \ndiabetes; excess folds of the conjunctiva; blindness; blurred, double and halo vision; cataracts; \nabnormal turning outward of the lower eyelid; small colored spots on the eye surface; eye \ndryness caused by inflammation of the glands of the eyelids; eye allergy; eyelid crusting; glassy \neyes; loss of eyelashes; tiredness \n\n• General side effects: Increased allergic symptoms; dizziness; blurred vision; nasal discomfort \nand pain; redness or itching of the skin; rash on skin; inflammation of the cartilage; picking of \nthe skin  \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor,  or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \n\n\n\n22 \n\nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Rhokiinsa \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle and the carton after “EXP”. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened bottles: Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \nAfter opening the bottle: Do not store above 25°C. \nThrow away the bottle 4 weeks after first opening to prevent infections and use a new bottle.  \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
