NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBaqsimi 3 mg nasal powder in single-dose container \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach single-dose container delivers nasal powder with 3 mg of glucagon. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nNasal powder in single-dose container (nasal powder). \n \nWhite to practically white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBaqsimi is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children \naged 4 years and over with diabetes mellitus. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults, adolescents and children aged 4 years and over \nThe recommended dose is 3 mg glucagon administered into one nostril. \n \nElderly (\u2265 65 years) \nNo dose adjustment is required based on age.  \n \nEfficacy and safety data are very limited in patients aged 65 years and absent in patients aged 75 and \nabove. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required based on renal and hepatic function. \n \nPaediatric population 0 - < 4 years \nThe safety and efficacy of Baqsimi in infants and children aged 0 to < 4 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nNasal use only. Glucagon nasal powder is given in a single nostril. Glucagon is passively absorbed \nthrough the nasal mucosa. It is not necessary to inhale or breathe deeply after dosing. \n \nInstructions for administering glucagon nasal powder   \n1. Remove the shrink wrap by pulling on the red stripe. \n2. Remove the single-dose container from the tube. Do not press the plunger until ready to give the \n\ndose. \n3. Hold the single-dose container between fingers and thumb. Do not test before use as it contains \n\n\n\n3 \n\nonly one dose of glucagon and cannot be reused. \n4. Insert the tip of the single-dose container gently in one of the nostrils until finger(s) touch the \n\noutside of the nose. \n5. Push the plunger all the way in. The dose is complete when the green line is no longer showing. \n6. If the person is unconscious, turn the person on their side to prevent choking. \n7. After giving the dose, the caregiver should call for medical help right away. \n8. When the patient has responded to treatment, give oral carbohydrate to restore liver glycogen \n\nand prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPhaeochromocytoma (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPhaeochromocytoma \n \nIn the presence of phaeochromocytoma, glucagon may stimulate the release of catecholamines from \nthe tumour. If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure, use of non-selective \n\u03b1-adrenergic blockade has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure.  Baqsimi is \ncontraindicated in patients with phaeochromocytoma (see section 4.3). \n \nInsulinoma \n \nIn patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon may produce an initial increase in blood \nglucose. However, glucagon administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood \nglucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycaemia. A patient \ndeveloping symptoms of hypoglycaemia after a dose of glucagon should be given glucose orally or \nintravenously. \n \nHypersensitivity and allergic reactions  \n \nAllergic reactions, which have been reported with injectable glucagon, may occur and include \ngeneralised rash, and in some cases anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties, and hypotension. If \nthe patient experiences difficulty breathing call for immediate medical assistance. \n \nGlycogen stores and hypoglycaemia  \n \nGlucagon is effective in treating hypoglycaemia only if sufficient liver glycogen is present. Because \nglucagon is of little or no help in states of starvation, adrenal insufficiency, chronic alcohol abuse or \nchronic hypoglycaemia, these conditions should be treated with glucose. \n \nTo prevent relapse of the hypoglycaemia, oral carbohydrates should be given to restore liver glycogen, \nwhen the patient has responded to treatment. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nInsulin \nReacts antagonistically towards glucagon \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIndometacin \n \nWhen used with indometacin, glucagon may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even \nproduce hypoglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers \n \nPatients taking beta-blockers might be expected to have a greater increase in both pulse and blood \npressure, an increase of which will be transient because of glucagon's short half-life. \n \nGlucagon treatment results in catecholamine release from the adrenal glands, and concomitant use of \nbeta-blockers could result in unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation and consequently, a greater \nincrease in blood pressure (see section 4.4). \n \nWarfarin \n \nGlucagon may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nReproduction and fertility studies with glucagon nasal powder were not conducted in animals.  \n \nBaqsimi can be used during pregnancy. Glucagon does not cross the human placenta barrier. The use \nof glucagon has been reported in pregnant women with diabetes and no harmful effects are known \nwith respect to the course of pregnancy and the health of the unborn and the neonate.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBaqsimi can be used during breast-feeding  Glucagon is cleared from the bloodstream very quickly  \nand thus the amount excreted in the milk of nursing mothers following treatment of severe \nhypoglycaemic reactions is expected to be extremely small. As glucagon is degraded in the digestive \ntract and cannot be absorbed in its intact form, it will not exert any metabolic effect in the child. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility studies have been conducted with glucagon nasal powder. \n \nStudies in rats have shown that glucagon does not cause impaired fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nBaqsimi has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nThe patient\u2019s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia which may \npersist for a brief period after receiving treatment. This may present a risk in situations where these \nabilities are especially important, such as driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions are lacrimation increased (36 %), upper respiratory \ntract irritation (34 %), nausea (27 %), headache (21 %), and vomiting (16 %). \n \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed in table 1 as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and frequency. \nThe corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). \n \nTable 1. Frequency of adverse reactions of glucagon nasal powder \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Common Uncommon \nNervous system disorders Headache Dysgeusia  \nEye disorders Lacrimation \n\nincreased \n \n\nOcular hyperaemia \nEye pruritus \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUpper respiratory \ntract irritationa \n\n  \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Vomiting \nNausea \n\n  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Pruritus  \n\nInvestigations  Increased systolic \nblood pressureb \nIncreased diastolic \nblood pressureb \n\nIncreased heart \nrateb \n\na Upper respiratory tract irritation: rhinorrhoea, nasal discomfort, nasal congestion, nasal \npruritus, sneezing, throat irritation, cough, epistaxis, and parosmia \n\nb Increases in heart rate and blood pressure: as assessed by vital sign measurements. \nFrequencies are based on shifts from pre-treatment to post-treatment values. \n\n \nImmunogenicity \nOverall, 5.6 % of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-glucagon antibodies. These antibodies \nwere not neutralising and did not lower the efficacy of glucagon nor were they associated with the \ndevelopment of treatment-emergent adverse reactions. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nBased on data from clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed in \nchildren are expected to be the same as in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, inhibition of gastro-intestinal tract \nmotility, increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. In case of suspected overdosing, serum potassium \nmay decrease and should be monitored and corrected if needed. If the patient develops a dramatic \nincrease in blood pressure, use of non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic blockade has been shown to be effective \nin lowering blood pressure for the short time that control would be needed (see section 4.4). \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pancreatic hormones, Glycogenolytic hormones, ATC code: H04AA01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nGlucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby \nstimulating glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are \nnecessary for glucagon to produce an anti-hypoglycaemic effect. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nGender and body weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacodynamics of glucagon \nnasal powder. \n \nAfter administration of 3 mg glucagon nasal powder in adult patients with type 1 diabetes, glucose \nlevels began to rise as early as 5 minutes (figure 1). By 10 minutes, the median glucose level was \nabove 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). The mean maximum glucose increase was 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). \n \nIn paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (4 to < 17 years), after administration of 3 mg glucagon \nnasal powder, glucose levels began to rise as early as 5 minutes (figure 2) with a mean maximum \nglucose increase of 5.7 mmol/L (102 mg/dL) to 7.7 mmol/L (138 mg/dL). \n \nCommon cold with nasal congestion with or without concomitant use of a decongestant did not impact \npharmacodynamics of glucagon nasal powder. \n \nFigure 1. Mean glucose concentration over time in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFigure 2. Mean glucose concentration over time in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. \n\n \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nThe adult pivotal study was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, 2-period, cross-over study in adult \npatients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of \na single 3 mg dose of glucagon nasal powder against a 1 mg dose of intra-muscular (i.m.) glucagon in \nadult patients with type 1 diabetes. Insulin was used to reduce blood glucose levels to the \nhypoglycaemic range with a target blood glucose nadir of < 2.8 mmol/L (< 50 mg/dL). \n \nThe pivotal study enrolled 83 total patients 18 to < 65 years of age. Seventy-seven patients had type 1 \ndiabetes, with a mean age of 32.9 years and a mean diabetes duration of 18.1 years, and 45 (58 %) \npatients were female. The mean age of patients with type 2 diabetes (n=6) was 47.8 years, with a mean \ndiabetes duration of 18.8 years, and 4 (67 %) patients were female. \n \nThe primary efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving treatment success, \nwhich was defined as either an increase in blood glucose to \u2265 3.9 mmol/L (\u2265 70 mg/dL) or an increase \nof \u2265 1.1 mmol/L (\u2265 20 mg/dL) from glucose nadir within 30 minutes after receiving study glucagon, \nwithout receiving additional actions to increase the blood glucose level. Glucose nadir was defined as \nthe minimum glucose measurement at the time of, or within 10 minutes, following glucagon \nadministration. \n \nFor patients with type 1 diabetes, the mean nadir blood glucose was 2.5 mmol/L (44.2 mg/dL) for \nglucagon nasal powder and 2.7 mmol/L (48.9 mg/dL) for i.m. glucagon. Glucagon nasal powder \ndemonstrated non-inferiority to i.m. glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycaemia with 98.7 % \nof glucagon nasal powder-treated patients and 100 % of i.m. glucagon-treated patients achieving \ntreatment success within 30 minutes (table 2). All patients met glucose treatment success criteria \nwithin 40 minutes. All patients with type 2 diabetes (100 %) achieved treatment success within \n30 minutes. \n \nThe mean time to treatment success was 16.2 and 12.2 minutes in the glucagon nasal powder and i.m. \nglucagon 1 mg treatment groups, respectively. Time to treatment success represents the time from \nglucagon administration to patient achieving treatment success; it does not include the time for \nreconstitution and preparation of the intra-muscular injection in the control group. \n \n\nTime (minutes)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nM\nea\n\nn \nG\n\nlu\nco\n\nse\n (m\n\nm\nol\n\n/L\n)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nM\nea\n\nn \nG\n\nlu\nco\n\nse\n (m\n\ng/\ndL\n\n)\n\n36\n\n54\n\n72\n\n90\n\n108\n\n126\n\n144\n\n162\n\n180\n\n198\n\n216\n\n234\n\n252\n\n4 to <8 years \n8 to <12 years \n12 to <17 years\n\n\n\n8 \n\nBy 30 minutes post glucagon administration, patients in both glucagon nasal powder and i.m. \nglucagon groups had similar improvement in symptoms of hypoglycaemia, as evaluated by Edinburgh \nHypoglycaemia Symptom Questionnaire. \n \nTable 2.

A total of \n157 moderate or severe hypoglycaemic events reported by 69 patients were included in the efficacy \nanalysis. An episode of severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode wherein the person with \ndiabetes is clinically incapacitated (that is, unconscious, convulsions, severe mental disorientation) to \nthe point where the person requires third-party assistance to treat the hypoglycaemia. An episode of \nmoderate hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode wherein the person with diabetes was showing \nsigns of neuroglycopenia (that is, weakness, difficulty speaking, double vision, drowsiness, inability to \nconcentrate, blurred vision, anxiety, hunger, tiredness or confusion) and had a glucometer reading of \napproximately 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or less. In 151 (96.2 %) of these events, patients awoke or \nreturned to normal status within 30 minutes following glucagon nasal powder administration. In all \n(100 %) 12 severe hypoglycaemic events, patients awoke, stopped convulsions (7 events from \n4 patients having presented with convulsions before glucagon nasal powder dosing) or returned to \nnormal status within 5 to 15 minutes following glucagon nasal powder administration. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe paediatric pivotal study was a randomized, multicenter, clinical study that assessed glucagon nasal \npowder compared to i.m. glucagon in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Glucagon was \nadministered after glucose reached < 4.4 mmol/L (< 80 mg/dL) on the dosing day. Efficacy was \nassessed based on percentage of patients with a glucose increase of \u2265 1.1 mmol/L (\u2265 20 mg/dL) from \nglucose nadir within 30 minutes following glucagon administration. \n \nForty-eight patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medicinal product. The mean \nage in the young children cohort (4 to < 8 years) was 6.5 years. In the children cohort \n(8 to < 12 years), mean age was 11.1 years and in the adolescents cohort (12 to < 17 years) mean age \nwas 14.6 years. In all age cohorts, the population was predominantly male and white. \n \nAcross all age groups, 3 mg glucagon nasal powder and i.m. glucagon 0.5 mg (children below 25 kg) \nor 1 mg (children 25 kg or above), demonstrated similar glycemic responses. All (100 %) patients in \nboth treatment arms across all age groups achieved an increase in glucose \u2265 1.1 mmol/L (\u2265 20 mg/dL) \nfrom glucose nadir within 20 minutes of glucagon administration. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nThe mean time to reach a glucose increase of \u2265 1.1 mmol/L (\u2265 20 mg/dL) was similar between \nglucagon nasal powder and i.m. glucagon for all age groups (table 4). \n \nTable 4.

A total of 33 moderate hypoglycaemic events reported by 14 patients were \nincluded in the efficacy analysis. An episode of major hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode with \nneuroglycopenia symptoms and a glucose level below 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L). An episode of \nmoderate hypoglycaemia is defined as an episode wherein the child/adolescent with diabetes has \nsymptoms and/or signs of neuroglycopenia and has a blood glucose level of \u2264 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). \nIn all events, including major hypoglycaemia (8 events from 5 patients), patients returned to normal \nstatus within 5 to 30 minutes following glucagon nasal powder administration. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nBaqsimi in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nGlucagon absorption via the nasal route achieved mean peak plasma levels of 6130 pg/mL at \n15 minutes. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of glucagon was approximately 885 L via the nasal route.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nGlucagon is known to be degraded in the liver, kidneys, and plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nThe mean half-life of glucagon was approximately 38 minutes via the nasal route. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nNo formal studies have been performed to evaluate renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn paediatric patients (4 to < 17 years), glucagon absorption via the nasal route, achieved mean peak \nplasma levels between 15 and 20 minutes.    \n \nCommon cold and use of degongestant \n \nCommon cold with nasal congestion with or without concomitant use of a decongestant did not impact \npharmacokinetics via the nasal route. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and local tolerance with glucagon nasal powder. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n24 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nBaqsimi 3 mg nasal powder in single-dose container \nglucagon \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Baqsimi is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Baqsimi  \n3. How Baqsimi is given \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Baqsimi  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Baqsimi is and what it is used for \n \nBaqsimi contains the active substance glucagon, which belongs to a group of medicines called \nglycogenolytic hormones. It is used to treat severe hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar) in people \nwith diabetes. It is for use in adults, adolescents, and children aged 4 years or older. \n \nGlucagon is a natural hormone produced by the pancreas. It works in the opposite way to insulin and \nraises blood sugar. It does this by converting stored sugar in the liver called glycogen to glucose (a \nform of sugar that the body uses for energy). The glucose then enters the bloodstream and raises the \nblood sugar level, so reducing the effects of hypoglycaemia. \n \nYou should always carry Baqsimi with you and tell your friends and family that you are carrying it. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Baqsimi \n \nImportant information \nIf you are at risk of severe hypoglycaemia you should always have Baqsimi readily available:  \n- show your family members, friends, or people you work with where you keep this medicine and \n\nexplain when and how to use it. Delay in treatment may be harmful. It is important they know \nhow to use Baqsimi before you need it. \n\n \nDo not use Baqsimi \n- if you are allergic to glucagon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have phaeochromocytoma, which is a tumour in the adrenal gland (a gland above your \n\nkidneys). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Baqsimi: \n- if you have a tumour in your pancreas called insulinoma. \n- if you have insufficient liver glycogen. This could occur: \n\n\n\n25 \n\n- in states of starvation.   \n- if your adrenal gland does not produce enough cortisol or aldosterone.  \n- if you suffer from chronic hypoglycaemia. \n\n \nIf you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nusing Baqsimi. \n \nAfter using Baqsimi, eat as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of low blood sugar. Take a fast-\nacting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugar-containing carbonated drink. \n \nChildren \nBaqsimi is not recommended for children under 4 years of age because it has not been studied in this \nage group. \n \nOther medicines and Baqsimi \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nThe following medicines can affect the way Baqsimi works: \n- insulin \u2013 used to treat diabetes. Insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood sugar. \n- indometacin, used to treat joint pain and stiffness. Indometacin reduces the effect of glucagon. \n \nThe following medicines may be affected by Baqsimi: \n- warfarin, used to prevent blood clots. Baqsimi may increase the anticlotting effect of warfarin. \n- beta-blockers, used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Baqsimi may increase \n\nblood pressure and pulse.  This will only last a short time. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf your blood sugar drops very low when you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you can use Baqsimi. \n \nDriving and using machines \nWait until the effects of very low blood sugar have worn off, before driving or using any tools or \nmachines. \n \n \n3. How Baqsimi is given \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nExplain how to use Baqsimi to your family, friends, co-workers or care-giver. They will need to know \nhow to use it before you need it. \n \nBaqsimi is given as a single 3 mg dose. \n \nInstructions for giving Baqsimi  \n1. Remove the shrink wrap by pulling on the red stripe. \n2. Open the lid and remove the single-dose container from the tube. \nCaution: Do not press the plunger before insertion into the nose, otherwise the single dose in the \nsingle-dose container will be lost. \n\n \nGiving the dose \n \n1. Hold the single-dose container between fingers and thumb. Do not test before use as it contains \n\nonly one dose of glucagon and cannot be reused. \n2. Insert the tip gently into a nostril until the finger touches the outside of the nose. \n3. Push the plunger all the way in with your thumb. The dose is complete when the green line no \n\nlonger shows on the plunger. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n4. If the person with the low blood sugar is unconscious, turn the person to their side to prevent \nchoking. \n\n5. After giving the dose, call for medical help right away. \n6. Encourage the person with the low blood sugar to eat as soon as possible. A high sugar snack \n\nwill stop another fall in blood sugar level. \n \nRead the \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d carefully before using Baqsimi. \n \nIf you are given more Baqsimi than you should \nToo much Baqsimi may cause nausea and vomiting. It may also raise your blood pressure and pulse \nrate. Specific treatment is not usually necessary. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nVery common side effects that may affect more than 1 in 10 people using this medicine are: \n- Nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick) \n- Headache \n- Discomfort and other effects in the nose, including itchiness, sneezing, runny or blocked nose \n\nand bleeding \n- Altered sense of smell \n- Throat irritation and cough \n- Watery eyes \n \nCommon side effects that may affect up to 1 in 10 people using this medicine are: \n- Increased blood pressure \n- Itchy and red eyes \n- Itchy skin \n- Altered sense of taste \n \nUncommon side effects that may affect up to 1 in 100 people using this medicine \n- Increase heart rate  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Baqsimi \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton, tube and single-dose \ncontainer after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nDo not store above 30 \u00b0C. \n \nKeep the single-dose container in the shrink wrapped tube until ready to use in order to protect from \nmoisture.  \n \nIf the tube has been opened, the single-dose container may have been exposed to moisture.

glycogenolytic hormones. it is used to treat severe hypoglycaemia (very low blood sugar) in people with diabetes. it is for use in adults, adolescents, and children aged 4 years or older. glucagon is a natural hormone produced by the pancreas. it works in the opposite way to insulin and raises blood sugar. it does this by converting stored sugar in the liver called glycogen to glucose (a form of sugar that the body uses for energy). the glucose then enters the bloodstream and raises the blood sugar level, so reducing the effects of hypoglycaemia. you should always carry baqsimi with you and tell your friends and family that you are carrying it.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "baqsimi", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the active substance glucagon",

readily available: - show your family members, friends, or people you work with where you keep this medicine and explain when and how to use it. delay in treatment may be harmful. it is important they know how to use baqsimi before you need it. do not use baqsimi - if you are allergic to glucagon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have phaeochromocytoma, which is a tumour in the adrenal gland (a gland above your kidneys). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using baqsimi: - if you have a tumour in your pancreas called insulinoma. - if you have insufficient liver glycogen. this could occur: 25 - in states of starvation. - if your adrenal gland does not produce enough cortisol or aldosterone. - if you suffer from chronic hypoglycaemia. if you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using baqsimi. after using baqsimi, eat as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of low blood sugar. take a fast- acting source of sugar, such as fruit juice or a sugar-containing carbonated drink. children baqsimi is not recommended for children under 4 years of age because it has not been studied in this age group. other medicines and baqsimi tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. the following medicines can affect the way baqsimi works: - insulin used to treat diabetes. insulin has the opposite effect of glucagon on blood sugar. - indometacin, used to treat joint pain and stiffness. indometacin reduces the effect of glucagon. the following medicines may be affected by baqsimi: - warfarin, used to prevent blood clots. baqsimi may increase the anticlotting effect of warfarin. - beta-blockers, used to treat high blood pressure and irregular heart beat. baqsimi may increase blood pressure and pulse. this will only last a short time. pregnancy and breast-feeding if your blood sugar drops very low when you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you can use baqsimi. driving and using machines wait until the effects of very low blood sugar have worn off,
