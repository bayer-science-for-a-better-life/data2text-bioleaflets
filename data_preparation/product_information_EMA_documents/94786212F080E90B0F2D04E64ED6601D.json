CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment of essential hypertension in adults. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or \n\nhydrochlorothiazide used alone. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT is indicated as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\nThe recommended dose of Rasilez HCT is one tablet per day. \n\n \n\nThe antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect is generally \n\nseen within 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nPosology in patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy \n\nIndividual dose titration with each of the two components may be recommended before changing to \n\nthe fixed combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed \n\ncombination may be considered. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 150 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg alone. \n\nRasilez HCT 150 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 150 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg alone or by Rasilez HCT \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\nRasilez HCT 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg alone or by Rasilez HCT \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\nRasilez HCT 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \n\ncontrolled with aliskiren 300 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg alone or by Rasilez HCT \n\n300 mg/12.5 mg or Rasilez HCT 150 mg/25 mg. \n\n \n\nIf blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2-4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a \n\nmaximum of Rasilez HCT 300 mg/25 mg daily. Dosing should be individualised and adjusted \n\naccording to the patient’s clinical response. \n\n \n\nPosology as substitution therapy \n\nFor convenience, patients receiving aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets may be \n\nswitched to a fixed combination tablet of Rasilez HCT containing the same component doses. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nRenal impairment \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasilez HCT is contraindicated for use in patients with \n\nanuria and in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n\n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). No adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate \n\nrenal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nRasilez HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or progressive liver disease. No \n\n\n\n4 \n\nadjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \n\nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly people (over 65 years) \n\nThe recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. No clinically meaningful \n\nadditional blood pressure reduction is observed by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rasilez HCT in children below 18 years have not yet been established. No \n\ndata are available. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT is contraindicated in children from birth to less than 2 years. Rasilez HCT should not be \n\nused in children aged 2 to less than 6 years because of safety concerns due to potential aliskiren \n\noverexposure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3). The safety and efficacy of Rasilez HCT in children \n\naged 6 to 17 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, \n\n5.1, and 5.2. Use of Rasilez HCT is not recommended in this population. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nOral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. Rasilez HCT should be taken once \n\na day, always with or always without food, preferably at the same time each day. Patients should \n\nestablish a convenient daily schedule of medicinal product intake and maintain a steady temporal \n\nrelationship with food intake. Concomitant intake with fruit juice and/or drinks containing plant \n\nextracts (including herbal teas) should be avoided (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n− Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to \nother sulfonamide-derived substances. \n\n− History of angioedema with aliskiren. \n\n− Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. \n\n− Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n− Anuria. \n\n− Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). \n\n− Hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia, symptomatic hyperuricaemia and refractory hypokalaemia. \n\n− Severe hepatic impairment. \n\n− The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent  \nP-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine), is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). \n\n− The concomitant use of Rasilez HCT with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) \nor an angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) is contraindicated in patients with diabetes \n\nmellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n− Children from birth to less than 2 years (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n\nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \n\ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \n\nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \n\nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \n\n \n\nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \n\nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \n\nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \n\n\n\n5 \n\nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \n\nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \n\nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n\n(see also section 4.8). \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nIn the event of severe and perisistent diarrhoea, Rasilez HCT therapy should be stopped  \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \nHypotension, syncope, stroke, hyperkalaemia, and decreased renal function (including acute renal \n\nfailure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that \n\naffect this system (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI \n\nor an ARB is therefore not recommended. If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, \n\nthis should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal \n\nfunction, electrolytes and blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with serious congestive heart failure (New York \n\nHeart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV) (see section 5.1). Rasilez HCT should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with heart failure due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data. \n\n \n\nAliskiren should be used with caution in patients with heart failure treated with furosemide or \n\ntorasemide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nRisk of symptomatic hypotension \n\nSymptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Rasilez HCT in the following \n\ncases: \n\n• Patients with marked volume depletion or patients with salt depletion (e.g. those receiving high \ndoses of diuretics) or \n\n• Combined use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS. \nThe volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Rasilez HCT, or the \n\ntreatment should start under close medical supervision. \n\n \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nTreatment with Rasilez HCT should only start after correction of hypokalaemia and any coexisting \n\nhypomagnesaemia. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hypokalaemia or exacerbate pre-\n\nexisting hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics should be administered with caution in patients with \n\nconditions involving enhanced potassium loss, for example salt-losing nephropathies and prerenal \n\n(cardiogenic) impairment of kidney function. If hypokalaemia develops during hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntherapy Rasilez HCT should be discontinued until stable correction of the potassium balance. \n\nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \n\naliskiren may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \n\nwith cirrhosis of the liver, patients experiencing brisk diuresis, patients with inadequate oral \n\nelectrolyte intake and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \n\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nConversely, increases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren in post-marketing \n\nexperience and these may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or \n\nby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consistent with standard medical practice, \n\nperiodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-administration is \n\nconsidered necessary (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nThiazide diuretics can precipitate new onset hyponatraemia and hypochloroaemic alkalosis or \n\nexacerbate pre-existing hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia, accompanied by neurological symptoms \n\n(nausea, progressive disorientation, apathy) has been observed. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide \n\nshould only be started after correction of pre-existing hyponatraemia. In case severe or rapid \n\n\n\n6 \n\nhyponatraemia develops during Rasilez HCT therapy, the treatment should be discontinued until \n\nnormalisation of natraemia. \n\n \n\nThere is no evidence that Rasilez HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \n\nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n\n \n\nAll patients receiving thiazide diuretics should be periodically monitored for imbalances in \n\nelectrolytes, particularly potassium, sodium and magnesium. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasilez HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Rasilez HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n\nThiazide diuretics may precipitate azotaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. When Rasilez \n\nHCT is used in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum electrolytes including \n\npotassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. Rasilez HCT is contraindicated in \n\npatients with severe renal impairment or anuria (see section 4.2 and 4.3) \n\nThere is no experience regarding the administration of Rasilez HCT in patients who have recently \n\nundergone kidney transplantation. Rasilez HCT should be used with caution in patients who have \n\nrecently undergone kidney transplantation due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data.  \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when aliskiren is given in the presence of  conditions pre-disposing to \n\nkidney dysfunction such as hypovolaemia (e.g. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhoea, \n\nprolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus or kidney disease. Acute renal \n\nfailure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving \n\naliskiren in post-marketing experience. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren \n\nshould be promptly discontinued. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere are no data with Rasilez HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. Rasilez HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution in patients \n\nwith mild to moderate hepatic impairment or progressive liver disease. No adjustment of the initial \n\ndose is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\nSpecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \n\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\nRenal artery stenosis and renovascular hypertension \n\nNo controlled clinical data are available on the use of Rasilez HCT in patients with unilateral or \n\nbilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary kidney. However, there is an increased risk of \n\nrenal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, when patients with renal artery stenosis are treated \n\nwith aliskiren. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients. If renal failure occurs, \n\ntreatment should be discontinued. \n\n \n\nAnaphylactic reactions and angioedema \n\nAnaphylactic reactions have been observed during treatment with aliskiren from post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.8). Angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the \n\nface, lips, throat and/or tongue) have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nA number of these patients had a history of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema, \n\nwhich in some cases followed use of other medicinal product that can cause angioedema, including \n\n\n\n7 \n\nRAAS blockers (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) (see \n\nsection 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported when \n\naliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn a post-authorisation observational study, the co-administration of aliskiren with ACEIs or ARBs has \n\nbeen associated with an increased risk of angioedema. The mechanism of this effect has not been \n\nestablished. In general, dual blockade of the RAAS by combining aliskiren with an ACEI or an ARB \n\nis not recommended (see section “Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \n\n(RAAS)” above and also sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nSpecial caution is necessary in patients with a hypersensitivity predisposition. \n\n \n\nPatients with a history of angioedema may be at increased risk of experiencing angioedema during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Caution should therefore be exercised when \n\nprescribing aliskiren to patients with a history of angioedema, and such patients should be closely \n\nmonitored during treatment (see section 4.8) especially at the beginning of the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf anaphylactic reactions or angioedema occur, Rasilez HCT should be promptly discontinued and \n\nappropriate therapy and monitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and \n\nsymptoms has occurred. Patients should be informed to report to the physician any signs suggestive of \n\nallergic reactions, in particular difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of face, extremities, \n\neyes, lips or tongue. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, adrenaline should be \n\nadministered. In addition, measures necessary to maintain patent airways should be provided. \n\n \n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, have been reported to exacerbate or activate \n\nsystemic lupus erythematosus. In the event that any signs or clinical suspicion of systematic lupus \n\nerythematosus (SLE), Rasilez HCT should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and \n\nmonitoring provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred.   \n\n \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n\nThiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels \n\nof cholesterol and triglycerides, and uric acid. In diabetic patients dose adjustments of insulin or oral \n\nhypoglycaemic agents may be required. \n\n \n\nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Rasilez HCT is contraindicated in symptomatic \n\nhyperuricaemia (see section 4.3). Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to \n\nreduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricaemia as well as precipitate gout \n\nin susceptible patients. \n\n \n\nThiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and may cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \n\nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Rasilez HCT is \n\ncontraindicated in patients with hypercalcaemia and should only be used after correction of any pre-\n\nexisting hypercalcaemia. Rasilez HCT should be discontinued if hypercalcaemia develops during \n\ntreatment. Serum levels of calcium should be periodically monitored during treatment with thiazides. \n\nMarked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be \n\ndiscontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity \n\nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If \n\nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment with Rasilez HCT, it is recommended to stop the \n\ntreatment. If a re-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect \n\nexposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nChoroidal effusion, acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma \n\nSulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction resulting in choroidal \n\neffusion with visual field defect, transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms \n\ninclude acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks \n\nof drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The \n\nprimary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical \n\ntreatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for \n\ndeveloping acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. \n\n \n\nGeneral \n\nExcessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic \n\ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients, but are more likely in patients \n\nwith allergy and asthma. \n\n \n\nExcipients \n\nRasilez HCT contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total \n\nlactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT contains wheat starch.  Wheat starch in this medicine contains only very low levels of \n\ngluten (less than 100ppm) and is very unlikely to cause problems if you have coeliac disease. One \n\ndosage unit contains no more than 100 micrograms of gluten. If you have wheat allergy (different \n\nfrom coeliac disease) you should not take this medicine. You should consult your doctor prior to \n\ntaking this medicine.   \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nAliskiren is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and there is a potential for aliskiren overexposure in \n\nchildren with an immature P-gp drug transporter system. The age at which the transporter system is \n\nmature cannot be determined (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). Therefore, Rasilez HCT is contraindicated in \n\nchildren from birth to less than 2 years and should not be used in children aged 2 to less than 6 years \n\n(see section 4.2 and 4.3). The safety and efficacy of aliskiren in children aged 6 to 17 years have not \n\nyet been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInformation on Rasilez HCT interactions \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nThe potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is attenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of \n\naliskiren. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium would be expected to be \n\npotentiated by other medicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other \n\nkaliuretic diuretics, corticosteroids, laxatives, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), amphotericin, \n\ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G, salicylic acid derivatives). Conversely, concomitant use of other agents \n\naffecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum potassium levels (e.g. potassium-\n\nsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, heparin) may lead to \n\nincreases in serum potassium. If co-administration with an agent affecting the level of serum \n\npotassium is considered necessary, caution is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances  \n\nPeriodic monitoring of serum potassium is recommended when Rasilez HCT is administered with \n\nmedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, \n\nantiarrhythmics). \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors \n\n(COX-2 inhibitors), acetylsalicylic acid and non-selective NSAIDs  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nNSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. NSAIDs may also weaken the diuretic \n\nand antihypertensive activity of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nIn some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren \n\nand hydrochlorothiazide given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal \n\nfunction, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, the use of \n\nRasilez HCT with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. \n\n \n\nOther antihypertensive medicinal products  \n\nThe antihypertensive effect of Rasilez HCT may be increased with the concomitant use of other \n\nantihypertensive agents.  Therefore, caution should be used if coadmnistering with any other \n\nhypertensive agents \n\n \n\nAdditional information on aliskiren interactions \n\n \n\nContraindicated (see section 4.3) \n\n \n\nP-gp potent inhibitors \n\nA single dose interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) \n\nincreases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase \n\nmay be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC \n\nand Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of \n\naliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nNot recommended (see section 4.2) \n\n \n\nFruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts \n\nAdministration of fruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-\n\nadministration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC \n\nand co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. Co-\n\nadministration of orange or apple juice with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 62% decrease in aliskiren \n\nAUC or in a 63% decrease in aliskiren AUC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to an inhibition \n\nof organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren by components of fruit juice in \n\nthe gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, fruit juice should not be \n\ntaken together with Rasilez HCT. The effect of drinks containing plant extracts (including herbal teas) \n\non the absorption of aliskiren has not been investigated. However, compounds potentially inhibiting \n\norganic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake of aliskiren are widely present in fruits, \n\nvegetables, and many other plant products. Therefore, drinks containing plant extracts, including \n\nherbal teas, should not be taken together with Rasilez HCT. \n\n \n\nDual blockade of the RAAS with aliskiren, ARBs or ACEIs \n\nClinical study data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACEIs, \n\nARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, stroke, \n\nhyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a \n\nsingle RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nCaution required with concomitant use \n\n \n\nP-gp interactions \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). Rifampicin, which is an inducer of \n\nP-gp, reduced aliskiren bioavailability by approximately 50% in a clinical study. Other inducers of P-\n\ngp (St. John’s wort) might decrease the bioavailability of aliskiren. Although this has not been \n\ninvestigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates \n\nand P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors \n\nmay increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site \n\nwill likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nModerate P-gp inhibitors \n\nCo-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in \n\na 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the \n\npresence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the \n\ndose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended \n\ntherapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical studies. Preclinical studies \n\nindicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal \n\nabsorption and decreases biliary excretion. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is \n\nadministered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors (clarithromycin, \n\ntelithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum potassium levels \n\nConcomitant use of other agents affecting the RAAS, of NSAIDs or of agents that increase serum \n\npotassium levels (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing \n\npotassium, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium. If co-medication with an agent \n\naffecting the level of serum potassium is considered necessary, routine monitoring of potassium levels \n\nwould be advisable. \n\n \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n\nNSAIDs may reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised \n\nrenal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs \n\nmay result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is \n\nusually reversible. Therefore, the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially \n\nin elderly patients. \n\n \n\nFurosemide and torasemide \n\nOral co-administration of aliskiren and furosemide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren \n\nbut reduced exposure to furosemide by 20-30% (the effect of aliskiren on furosemide administered \n\nintramuscularly or intravenously has not been investigated). After multiple doses of furosemide \n\n(60 mg/day) co-administered with aliskiren (300 mg/day) to patients with heart failure the urinary \n\nsodium excretion and the urine volume were reduced during the first 4 hours by 31% and 24%, \n\nrespectively, as compared to furosemide alone. The mean weight of patients concomitantly treated \n\nwith furosemide and 300 mg aliskiren (84.6 kg) was higher than the weight of patients treated with \n\nfurosemide alone (83.4 kg). Smaller changes in furosemide pharmacokinetics and efficacy were \n\nobserved with aliskiren 150 mg/day. \n\n \n\nThe available clinical data did not indicate that higher doses of torasemide were used after co-\n\nadministration with aliskiren. Torasemide renal excretion is known to be mediated by organic anion \n\ntransporters (OATs). Aliskiren is minimally excreted via the renal route, and only 0.6% of the \n\naliskiren dose is recovered in urine following oral administration (see section 5.2). However, since \n\naliskiren has been shown to be a substrate for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 \n\n(OATP1A2) (see section ‘Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP’ below) inhibitors), there is \n\na potential for aliskiren to reduce plasma torasemide exposure by an interference with the absorption \n\nprocess. \n\n \n\nIn patients treated with both aliskiren and oral furosemide or torasemide, it is therefore recommended \n\nthat the effects of furosemide or torasemide be monitored when initiating and adjusting furosemide, \n\ntorasemide or aliskiren therapy to avoid changes in extracellular fluid volume and possible situations \n\nof volume overload (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nThe effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. \n\n \n\nFood interactions \n\nAlthough meals (low or high fat content) have been shown to reduce the absorption of aliskiren \n\nsubstantially, the efficacy of aliskiren was shown to be similar when taken either with a light meal or \n\n\n\n11 \n\nwithout a meal (see section 4.2). The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of \n\ndifferent types of foods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due \n\nto this additive effect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. Concomitant \n\nadministration of aliskiren with fruit juice or drinks containing plant extracts, including herbal teas, \n\nshould be avoided. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions with other medicinal products  \n\nCompounds that have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include acenocoumarol, \n\natenolol, celecoxib, pioglitazone, allopurinol, isosorbide-5-mononitrate and hydrochlorothiazide. No \n\ninteractions have been identified. \n\n \n\nCo-administration of aliskiren with either metformin (↓28%), amlodipine (↑29%) or cimetidine \n\n(↑19%) resulted in between 20% and 30% change in Cmax or AUC of aliskiren. When administered \n\nwith atorvastatin, steady-state aliskiren AUC and Cmax increased by 50%. Co-administration of \n\naliskiren had no significant impact on atorvastatin, metformin or amlodipine pharmacokinetics. As a \n\nresult no dose adjustment for aliskiren or these co-administered medicinal products is necessary. \n\n \n\nDigoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by aliskiren. \n\n \n\nCYP450 interactions \n\nAliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A). \n\nAliskiren does not induce CYP3A4. Therefore, aliskiren is not expected to affect the systemic \n\nexposure of substances that inhibit, induce or are metabolised by these enzymes. Aliskiren is \n\nmetabolised minimally by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Hence, interactions due to inhibition or \n\ninduction of CYP450 isoenzymes are not expected. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors often also affect P-\n\ngp. Increased aliskiren exposure during co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors that also inhibit P-gp \n\ncan therefore be expected (see other P-gp references in section 4.5). \n\n \n\nP-gp substrates or weak inhibitors \n\nNo relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When \n\nadministered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by \n\n50%. In experimental animals, it has been shown that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren \n\nbioavailability. Inducers of P-gp (St. John’s wort, rifampicin) might therefore decrease the \n\nbioavailability of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nOrganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors \n\nPreclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might be a substrate of organic anion transporting \n\npolypeptides. Therefore, the potential exists for interactions between OATP inhibitors and aliskiren \n\nwhen administered concomitantly (see section “Fruit juice and drinks containing plant extracts” \n\nabove).). \n\n \n\nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions \n\nWhen administered concurrently, the following medicinal products may interact with thiazide \n\ndiuretics: \n\n \n\nLithium  \n\nRenal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, therefore the risk of lithium toxicity may be \n\nincreased with hydrochlorothiazide. Co-administration of lithium and hydrochlorothiazide is not \n\nrecommended. If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \n\nrecommended during concomitant use. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes \n\nDue to the risk of hypokalaemia, hydrochlorothiazide should be administered with caution when \n\nassociated with medicinal products that could induce torsades de pointes, in particular Class Ia and \n\nClass III antiarrhythmics and some antipsychotics. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nMedicinal products affecting serum sodium level  \n\nThe hyponatraemic effect of diuretics may be intensified by concomitant administration of medicinal \n\nproducts such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, etc. Caution is indicated in long-term \n\nadministration of these medicinal products. \n\n \n\nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) \n\nHydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline. The clinical \n\nsignificance of this effect is uncertain and not sufficient to preclude their use. \n\n \n\nDigoxine or other digitalis glycosides \n\nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia may occur as undesirable effects, favouring the \n\nonset of digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias. \n\n \n\nVitamin D and calcium salts  \n\nAdministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with vitamin D or with calcium \n\nsalts may potentiate the rise in serum calcium. Concomitant use of thiazide type diuretics may lead to \n\nhypercalcaemia in patients pre-disposed for hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or \n\nvitamin-D-mediated conditions) by increasing tubular calcium reabsorption. \n\n \n\nAntidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin and oral antidiabetic agents)  \n\nThiazides may alter glucose tolerance. Dose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal product may be \n\nnecessary (see section 4.4). Metformin should be used with caution because of the risk of lactic \n\nacidosis induced by possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nBeta blockers and diazoxide \n\nConcomitant use of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, with beta blockers may increase \n\nthe risk of hyperglycaemia. Thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may enhance the \n\nhyperglycaemic effect of diazoxide. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products used in the treatment of gout  \n\nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \n\nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase of dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-\n\nadministration of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the incidence of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol. \n\n \n\nAnticholinergic agents and other medicinal products affecting gastric motility  \n\nThe bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, \n\nbiperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. \n\nConversely, it is anticipated that prokinetic substances such as cisapride may decrease the \n\nbioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics. \n\n \n\nAmantadine \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may increase the risk of adverse reactions caused by \n\namantadine. \n\n \n\nIon exchange resins  \n\nAbsorption of thiazide diuretics, including hydrochlorothiazide, is decreased by cholestyramine or \n\ncolestipol. This could result in sub-therapeutic effects of thiazide diuretics. However, staggering the \n\ndose of hydrochlorothiazide and resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours \n\nbefore or 4-6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimise the interaction. \n\n \n\nCytotoxic agents  \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic agents (e.g. \n\ncyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects. \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nNon-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants  \n\nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, potentiate the action of skeletal muscle relaxants such as \n\ncurare derivatives. \n\n \n\nAlcohol, barbiturates or narcotics  \n\nConcomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with subtances that also have a blood pressure \n\nlowering effect (e.g. by reducing sympathetic central nervous system activity or direct vasodilatation) \n\nmay potentiate orthostatic hypotension. \n\n \n\nMethyldopa  \n\nThere have been isolated reports of haemolytic anaemia occurring with concomitant use of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa. \n\n \n\nIodine contrasting agents  \n\nIn case of diuretic-induced dehydration, there is an increased risk of acute renal failure, especially with \n\nhigh doses of iodine products. Patients should be rehydrated before administration. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no data on the use of aliskiren in pregnant women. Aliskiren was not teratogenic in rats or \n\nrabbits (see section 5.3). Other substances that act directly on the RAAS have been associated with \n\nserious foetal malformations and neonatal death when used during second and third trimesters. There \n\nis limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. \n\nAnimal studies are insufficient. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of action of \n\nhydrochlorothiazide, its use during the second and third trimester may compromise foeto-placental \n\nperfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like icterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and \n\nthrombocytopenia. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or \n\npre-eclampsia due to the risk of decreased plasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a \n\nbeneficial effect on the course of the disease. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \n\nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n\n \n\nNo specific clinical studies have been performed with this combination, therefore Rasilez HCT should \n\nnot be used during the first trimester of pregnancy or in women planning to become pregnant and is \n\ncontraindicated during the second and third trimesters (see section 4.3). A switch to a suitable \n\nalternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected \n\nduring therapy, Rasilez HCT should be discontinued as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is not known whether aliskiren is excreted in human milk. Aliskiren was secreted in the milk of \n\nlactating rats. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \n\nintense diuresis can inhibit milk production. \n\n \n\nThe use of Rasilez HCT during breast-feeding is not recommended. If Rasilez HCT is used during \n\nbreast-feeding, doses should be kept as low as possible. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no clinical data on fertility. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When driving vehicles or \n\nusing machines, it must be borne in mind that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when \n\ntaking Rasilez HCT. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nThe safety of Rasilez HCT has been evaluated in more than 3,900 patients, including over 700 treated \n\nfor over 6 months, and 190 for over 1 year. The incidence of adverse reactions showed no association \n\nwith gender, age, body mass index, race or ethnicity. Treatment with Rasilez HCT had an overall \n\nincidence of adverse experiences at doses up to 300 mg/25 mg similar to placebo. The most common \n\nadverse reaction observed with Rasilez HCT is diarrhoea. The adverse reactions previously reported \n\nwith one of the individual components of Rasilez HCT (aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide) and \n\nincluded in the tabulated list of adverse reactions may occur with Rasilez HCT. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very \n\ncommon (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\nThe adverse reactions observed with Rasilez HCT or with monotherapy with one or both of the two \n\ncomponents are included in the table below. For adverse reactions observed with more than one \n\ncomponent of a fixed-dose combination, the highest frequency is listed in the table below. \n\n \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \n\nNot known Non-melanoma skin cancer (Basal cell carcinoma and \n\nSquamous cell carcinoma) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nRare Thrombocytopenia sometimes with purpurah \n\nVery rare Agranulocytosish, bone marrow depressionh, haemolytic \n\nanaemiah, leucopeniah \n\nNot known Aplastic anaemiah \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nRare Anaphylactic reactionsa, hypersensitivity reactionsa,h \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nVery common Hypokalaemiah \n\nCommon Hyperuricaemiah, hypomagnesaemiah \n\nRare Hypercalcaemiah, hyperglycaemiah, worsening of diabetic \n\nmetabolic stateh \n\nVery rare Hypochloraemic alkalosish \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nRare Depressionh, sleep disturbancesh \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nRare Headacheh, paraesthesiah \n\nEye disorders \n\nRare Visual impairmenth \n\nNot known Acute angle-closure glaucomah, choroidal effusionh \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nNot known Vertigoa \n\nCardiac disorders  \n\nCommon Dizzinessa,h \n\nUncommon Palpitationsa, oedema peripherala \n\nRare Cardiac arrhythmiash \n\n\n\n15 \n\nVascular disorders \n\nCommon Orthostatic hypotensionh \n\nUncommon Hypotensionc,a \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Cougha \n\nVery rare Respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary \n\noedema) h \n\nNot known Dyspnoeaa \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon Diarrhoeac,a,h, decreased appetiteh, nausea and vomitinga,h \n\nRare Abdominal discomforth, constipationh \n\nVery rare Pancreatitish \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nRare Intrahepatic cholestasish, jaundicea,h \n\nNot known Liver disordera,*, hepatitisa, liver failurea,** \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nCommon Urticaria and other forms of rasha,h \n\nUncommon Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including \n\nStevens Johnson syndromea, toxic epidermal necrolysis \n\n(TEN)a, oral mucosal reactionsa, pruritusa \n\nRare Angioedemaa, erythemaa, photosensitivity reactionsh \n\nVery rare Cutaneous lupus erythematosus-like reactionsh, reactivation \n\nof cutaneous lupus erythematosush, vasculitis necrotising and \n\ntoxic epidermal necrolysish \n\nNot known Erythema multiformeh \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nCommon Arthralgiaa \n\nNot known Muscle spasmh \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nUncommon Acute renal failurea,h, renal impairmenta \n\nNot known Renal dysfunctionh \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders \n\nCommon Impotenceh \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nNot known Astheniah, pyrexiah \n\nInvestigations \n\nVery common Increases in cholesterol and triglyceridesh \n\nCommon Hyperkalaemiaa, hyponatraemia c, a, h \n\nUncommon Liver enzyme increaseda \n\nRare Haemoglobin decreaseda, haematocrit decreaseda, blood \n\ncreatinine increaseda, glycosuriah \nc Adverse reaction observed with Rasilez HCT \na Adverse reaction observed with monotherapy with aliskiren \nh Adverse reaction observed with monotherapy with hydrochlorothiazide \n\n* Isolated cases of liver disorder with clinical symptoms and laboratory evidence of more marked \n\nhepatic dysfunction. \n\n** Including one case of “liver failure fulminant” reported in the post-marketing experience, for which \n\na causal relationship with aliskiren cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nDiarrhoea  \n\nDiarrhoea is a dose-related adverse reaction for aliskiren. In controlled clinical study, the incidence of \n\ndiarrhoea in Rasilez HCT-treated patients was 1.3% compared to 1.4% for aliskiren- or 1.9% for \n\nhydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nSerum potassium  \n\nIn a large placebo-controlled clinical study, the opposite effects of aliskiren (150 mg or 300 mg) and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) on serum potassium approximately balanced each other in \n\nmany patients. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Periodic determinations of \n\nserum potassium to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed in patients at risk at \n\nappropriate intervals (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nAdditional information on individual components \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual components may occur with Rasilez \n\nHCT even if not observed in clinical study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have occurred during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren. \n\n \n\nIn controlled clinical study, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions occurred rarely during \n\ntreatment with aliskiren with rates comparable to treatment with placebo or comparators. \n\n \n\nCases of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat and/or \n\ntongue) have also been reported in post-marketing experience. A number of these patients had a \n\nhistory of angioedema or symptoms suggestive of angioedema which in some cases was associated \n\nwith the administration of other medicinal products known to cause angioedema, including RAAS \n\nblockers (ACEIs or ARBs). \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, cases of angioedema or angioedema-like reactions have been reported \n\nwhen aliskiren was co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in post-marketing \n\nexperience (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn the event of any signs suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction/angioedema (in particular difficulties \n\nin breathing or swallowing, rash, itching, hives or swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips and/or \n\ntongue, dizziness) patients should discontinue treatment and contact the physician (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nArthralgia has been reported in post-marketing experience. In some cases this occurred as part of a \n\nhypersensitivity reaction. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience, renal dysfunction, and cases of acute renal failure have been reported in \n\npatients at risk (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nHaemoglobin and haematocrit  \n\nSmall decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.05 mmol/l and \n\n0.16 volume percent, respectively) were observed. No patients discontinued therapy due to anaemia. \n\nThis effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, such as ACEIs and \n\nARBs. \n\n \n\nSerum potassium  \n\nIncreases in serum potassium have been observed with aliskiren and these may be exacerbated by \n\nconcomitant use of other agents acting on the RAAS or by NSAIDs. Consistent with standard medical \n\npractice, periodic determination of renal function including serum electrolytes is advised if co-\n\nadministration is considered necessary. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nAliskiren has been evaluated for safety in a randomised, double-blind, 8-week study in \n\n267 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, followed by an extension \n\n\n\n17 \n\nstudy including 208 patients treated for 52 weeks. An additional 52 to 104 weeks non-interventional \n\nobservational extension study in 106 patients (no study treatment administered) was conducted with \n\nthe objective to evaluate the long-term safety in terms of growth and development of children 6-17 \n\nyears of age with hypertension (primary or secondary) at baseline in the core study, previously treated \n\nwith aliskiren.  \n\nThe frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children were generally similar to those seen \n\nin hypertensive adults. No overall clinically relevant adverse impact in paediatric patients aged 6 to \n\n17 years was observed after treatment with aliskiren for up to one year based on physical \n\ndevelopment, assessed in patients with primary or secondary hypertension, and  neurocognitive \n\ndevelopment assessed only in patients with secondary hypertension (19 patients: 9 previously treated \n\nwith aliskiren and  10 previously treated with enalapril). See section 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\nHydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, frequently in higher doses than \n\nthose contained in Rasilez HCT. The adverse reactions listed in the table above, which are marked \n\nwith the reference “h”, have been reported in patients treated with thiazide diuretics alone, including \n\nhydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer  \n\nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between \n\nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nSymptoms \n\n \n\nThe most likely manifestation of overdose would be hypotension, related to the antihypertensive effect \n\nof aliskiren. \n\n \n\nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \n\nhypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most \n\ncommon signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in \n\nmuscle spasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \n\nglycosides or certain antiarrhythmic medicinal products. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\n \n\nIf symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis, dialysis \n\nclearance of aliskiren was low (< 2% of oral clearance). Therefore, dialysis is not adequate to treat \n\naliskiren over-exposure. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; renin inhibitor, ATC \n\ncode: C09XA52 \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT combines two antihypertensive active substances to control blood pressure in patients \n\nwith essential hypertension: Aliskiren belongs to the class of direct renin inhibitors and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide to the class of thiazide diuretics. The combination of these substances with \n\ncomplementary mechanisms of action provides an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood \n\npressure to a greater degree than either component alone. \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\n \n\nAliskiren is an orally active, non-peptide, potent and selective direct inhibitor of human renin. \n\n \n\nBy inhibiting the enzyme renin, aliskiren inhibits the RAAS at the point of activation, blocking the \n\nconversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and decreasing levels of angiotensin I and \n\nangiotensin II. Whereas other agents that inhibit the RAAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors \n\n(ACEI) and angiotension II receptor blockers (ARB)) cause a compensatory rise in plasma renin \n\nactivity (PRA), treatment with aliskiren decreases PRA in hypertensive patients by approximately 50 \n\nto 80%. Similar reductions were found when aliskiren was combined with other antihypertensive \n\nagents. The clinical implications of the effects on PRA are not known at the present time. \n\n \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of aliskiren at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained \n\nover the entire 24-hour dose interval (maintaining benefit in the early morning) with a mean peak to \n\ntrough ratio for diastolic response of up to 98% for the 300 mg dose. 85 to 90% of the maximal blood-\n\npressure-lowering effect was observed after 2 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was \n\nsustained during long-term treatment (12 months), and was independent of age, gender, body mass \n\nindex and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nCombination therapy studies are available for aliskiren added to the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, the \n\ncalcium channel blocker amlodipine and the beta blocker atenolol. These combinations were \n\nefficacious and well tolerated. \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of aliskiren-based therapy were compared to ramipril-based therapy in a 9-\n\nmonth non-inferiority study in 901 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with essential systolic hypertension. \n\nAliskiren 150 mg or 300 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg or 10 mg per day were administered for \n\n36 weeks with optional add-on therapy of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg or 25 mg) at week 12, and \n\namlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) at week 22. Over the 12 week period, aliskiren monotherapy lowered \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure by 14.0/5.1 mmHg, compared to 11.6/3.6 mmHg for ramipril, \n\nconsistent with aliskiren being non-inferior to ramipril at the doses chosen and the differences in \n\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significant. Tolerability was comparable in both \n\ntreatment arms, however cough was more often reported with the ramipril regimen than the aliskiren \n\nregimen (14.2% vs. 4.4%), whilst diarrhoea was more common with the aliskiren regimen than for the \n\nramipril regimen (6.6% vs. 5.0%). \n\n \n\nIn a 8-week study in 754 hypertensive elderly (≥ 65 years) and very elderly patients (30% ≥ 75 years) \n\naliskiren at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg provided statistically significant superior reduction in \n\nblood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) when compared to placebo. No additional blood pressure \n\nlowering effect was detected with 300 mg aliskiren compared to 150 mg aliskiren. All three doses \n\nwere well tolerated in both elderly and very elderly patients. In a pooled analysis of efficacy and safety \n\ndata from clinical study up to 12 months duration, there was no statistically significant difference in \n\nblood pressure reduction between aliskiren 300 mg and aliskiren 150 mg in elderly patients \n\n(≥ 65 years). \n\n \n\nThere has been no evidence of first-dose hypotension and no effect on pulse rate in patients treated in \n\ncontrolled clinical studies. With cessation of treatment, blood pressure gradually returned towards \n\nbaseline levels over a period of several weeks, with no evidence of a rebound effect for blood pressure \n\nor PRA. \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nIn a 36-week study involving 820 patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, no changes in \n\nventricular remodelling as assessed by left ventricular end systolic volume were detected with \n\naliskiren compared to placebo on top of background therapy. \n\n \n\nThe combined rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, recurrent heart attack, \n\nstroke and resuscitated sudden death were similar in the aliskiren group and the placebo group. \n\nHowever, in patients receiving aliskiren there was a significantly higher rate of hyperkalaemia, \n\nhypotension and kidney dysfunction when compared to the placebo group. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular and/or renal benefit in a double-blind placebo controlled \n\nrandomised trial in 8,606 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (evidenced by \n\nproteinuria and/or GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) with or without cardiovascular disease. In most patients \n\narterial blood pressure was well controlled at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of \n\ncardiovascular and renal complications. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren 300 mg was compared to placebo when added to standard of care which \n\nincluded either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The \n\nstudy was discontinued prematurely because the participants were unlikely to benefit from aliskiren. \n\nThe final study results indicated a hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of 1.097 in favour of placebo \n\n(95.4% Confidence Interval: 0.987, 1.218, 2-sided p=0.0787). In addition, an increased incidence of \n\nadverse events was observed with aliskiren compared to placebo (38.2% versus 30.3%). In particular \n\nthere was an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (14.5% versus 12.4%), hyperkalaemia (39.1% \n\nversus 29.0%), hypotension-related events (19.9% versus 16.3%) and adjudicated stroke endpoints \n\n(3.4% versus 2.7%). The increased incidence of stroke was greater in patients with renal insufficiency. \n\n \n\nAliskiren 150 mg (increased to 300 mg if tolerated) added to conventional therapy was evaluated in a \n\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial in 1,639 patients with reduced ejection fraction \n\nhospitalised for an episode of acute heart failure (NYHA Class III–IV) who were haemodynamically \n\nstable at baseline. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure rehospitalisation \n\nwithin 6 months; secondary endpoints were assessed within 12 months. \n\n \n\nThe study showed no benefit of aliskiren when administered on top of standard therapy for acute heart \n\nfailure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Study results \n\nindicated a non-significant effect of aliskiren with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% Confidence Interval: \n\n0.76-1.12; p=0.41, aliskiren vs. placebo). Different treatment effects of aliskiren were reported for \n\noverall mortality within 12 months dependent on diabetes mellitus status. In the subgroup of patients \n\nwith diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence Interval: \n\n1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in favour of \n\naliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003. An increased \n\nincidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% versus \n\n12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared with \n\nplacebo and was greater in patients with diabetes. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was evaluated for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity benefit in a double-blind active \n\ncontrolled randomised study in 7,064 patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular \n\nejection fraction, of which 62% had a history of hypertension. The primary endpoint was a composite \n\nof cardiovascular death and first hospitalisation for heart failure. \n\n \n\nIn this study, aliskiren at a target dose of 300 mg was compared to enalapril at a target dose of 20 mg \n\nwhen added to standard of care which included a beta blocker (and a mineralocorticoid receptor \n\nantagonist in 37% of patients) and a diuretic as needed. The study also evaluated the combination of \n\naliskiren and enalapril. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.5 years. The final results of the study did not \n\ndemonstrate statistically that aliskiren was non-inferior to enalapril on the primary endpoint, however \n\nthere was essentially no difference in the observed incidence rates between aliskiren and enalapril \n\n(hazard ratio of 0.99 with 95% Confidence Interval: 0.90-1.10). There was no significant benefit of \n\nadding aliskiren to enalapril (primary endpoint: hazard ratio of 0.93 with 95% Confidence Interval: \n\n0.85-1.03; p=0.1724, combination versus enalapril). Treatment effects were similar in patients with \n\n\n\n20 \n\ndiabetes and with renal insufficiency. The incidence of adjudicated stroke was not significantly \n\ndifferent between the aliskiren and enalapril groups (4.4% versus 4.0%; HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.848, \n\n1.485) or between the combination and enalapril groups (3.7% versus 4.0%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.697, \n\n1.251). The incidence of adverse events tended to be higher in patients with diabetes, or with GFR \n\n<60 ml/min/1.73 m², or with age ≥ 65 years; however, there was no difference between patients treated \n\nwith aliskiren and those treated with enalapril. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of certain adverse events was similar between aliskiren and enalapril groups while there \n\nwas an increased incidence of adverse events with the combination of aliskiren and enalapril: \n\nhyperkalaemia (21.4%, 13.2%, and 15.9% for combination, aliskiren and enalapril respectively); renal \n\nimpairment/renal failure (23.2%, 17.4% and 18.7%) and hypotension related events (27.0%, 22.3% \n\nand 22.4%). \n\n \n\nThere was a statistically significant increased incidence of syncope with the combination of aliskiren \n\nand enalapril compared to enalapril in the overall population (4.2% versus 2.8%; RR 1.51, 95% CI \n\n1.11-2.05) and in the subgroups NYHA I/II overall (4.8% versus 3.0%; RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.29). \n\n \n\nThe incidence of atrial fibrillation was 11.1%, 13.3%, and 11.0% in the combination, aliskiren, and \n\nenalapril groups, respectively. \n\n \n\nStatistically significantly higher incidences in the occurrence of cardiac failure and ischaemic stroke \n\nwere also found for aliskiren compared to enalapril in patients with NYHA I/II with hypertension, and \n\nin the occurrence of chronic cardiac failure and ventricular extrasystole in patients with NYHA III/IV \n\nwith hypertension. For the combination of aliskiren and enalapril there were statistically significant \n\ndifferences in the rate of angina unstable compared to enalapril. \n\n \n\nNo clinically relevant differences in efficacy or safety results were observed in the subpopulation of \n\nelderly patients with a history of hypertension and chronic heart failure Class I-II compared to the \n\noverall study population. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nThe site of action of thiazide diuretics is primarily in the renal distal convoluted tubule. It has been \n\nshown that there is a high-affinity receptor in the renal cortex as the primary binding site for the \n\nthiazide diuretic action and inhibition of NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule. The mode of \n\naction of thiazides is through inhibition of the Na+Cl- symporter by competing for the Cl- site, thereby \n\naffecting electrolyte reabsorption mechanisms: directly increasing sodium and chloride excretion to an \n\napproximately equal extent, and indirectly by this diuretic action reducing plasma volume, with \n\nconsequent increases in plasma renin activity, aldosterone secretion and urinary potassium loss, and a \n\ndecrease in serum potassium. \n\n \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancer: Based on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-\n\ndependent association between HCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population \n\ncomprised of 71,533 cases of BCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 \n\npopulation controls, respectively. High HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an \n\nadjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear \n\ncumulative dose response relationship was observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a \n\npossible association between lip cancer (SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were \n\nmatched with 63,067 population controls, using a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-\n\nresponse relationship was demonstrated with an adjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR \n\n3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR 7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose \n\n(~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nOver 3,900 hypertensive patients received Rasilez HCT once daily in clinical study. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nIn hypertensive patients, once-daily administration of Rasilez HCT provided dose-dependent \n\nreductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure that were maintained over the entire 24-hour \n\ndose interval. The antihypertensive effect is largely manifested within 1 week and the maximum effect \n\nis generally seen within 4 weeks. The blood-pressure-lowering effect was sustained during long-term \n\ntreatment, and was independent of age, gender, body mass index and ethnicity. The antihypertensive \n\neffect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours. Upon withdrawal of the aliskiren \n\ntreatment (aliskiren with or without hydrochlorothiazide add-on), the return of blood pressure towards \n\nbaseline was gradual (3-4 weeks) with no evidence of the rebound effect. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT was studied in a placebo-controlled trial including 2,762 hypertensive patients with \n\ndiastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg and < 110 mmHg (mean baseline blood pressure of \n\n153.6/99.2 mmHg). In this study, Rasilez HCT in doses from 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nproduced dose-dependent blood pressure reductions (systolic/diastolic) from 17.6/11.9 mmHg to \n\n21.2/14.3 mmHg, respectively, compared to 7.5/6.9 mmHg with placebo. The greater blood pressure \n\nreductions with these combination doses were also significantly greater than the respective doses of \n\naliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide when used alone. The combination of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide neutralised the reactive increase of PRA caused by hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nWhen administered in hypertensive patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood \n\npressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg), Rasilez HCT in doses from \n\n150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg administered without up-titration from monotherapy demonstrated \n\nsignificantly greater systolic/diastolic blood pressure control rates (< 140/90 mmHg) as compared to \n\nthe respective monotherapies. In this population, Rasilez HCT 150 mg/12.5 mg to 300 mg/25 mg \n\nprovided dose-dependent systolic/diastolic blood pressure reduction from 20.6/12.4 mmHg to \n\n24.8/14.5 mmHg, which were significantly superior to the respective monotherapies. The safety of the \n\ncombination therapy was similar to the respective monotherapies regardless of severity of \n\nhypertension or of the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular risk. Hypotension and related \n\nadverse events were uncommon with the combination treatment, with no increased incidence in \n\nelderly patients. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 880 randomised patients not adequately responsive to aliskiren 300 mg treatment, the \n\ncombination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced systolic/diastolic blood \n\npressure reductions of 15.8/11.0 mmHg, which were significantly greater than aliskiren 300 mg \n\nmonotherapy. In a study in 722 randomised patients not adequately responsive to hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg treatment, the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg produced \n\nsystolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 16.78/10.7 mmHg, which were significantly greater \n\nthan hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg monotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn another clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of Rasilez HCT were also assessed in 489 obese \n\nhypertensive patients who did not respond to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (baseline systolic/diastolic \n\nblood pressure 149.4/96.8 mmHg). In this difficult-to-treat population, Rasilez HCT provided a blood \n\npressure reduction (systolic/diastolic) of 15.8/11.9 mmHg compared to 15.4/11.3 mmHg for \n\nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, 13.6/10.3 mmHg for amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide and \n\n8.6/7.9 mmHg for hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, with similar safety to hydrochlorothiazide \n\nmonotherapy. \n\n \n\nIn a study in 183 randomised patients with severe hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure \n\n≥ 105 and < 120 mmHg), aliskiren treatment regimen with optional addition of hydrochlorothiazide \n\n25 mg was shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing blood pressure. \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 8-week study with aliskiren monotherapy (3 dose groups \n\nby weight category [≥20 kg to <50 kg; ≥50 kg to <80 kg; ≥80 kg to ≤150 kg]: low 6.25/12.5/25 mg \n\n[0.13-0.31 mg/kg]; mid 37.5/75/150 mg [0.75-1.88 mg/kg]; and high dose 150/300/600 mg \n\n[3.0-7.5 mg/kg], with a wide dose ratio between the low, mid and high dose groups [1:6:24]) in 267 \n\npaediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, aliskiren lowered office \n\nand ambulatory blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner during the initial 4 week dose-finding \n\nphase of the study (Phase 1). However, in the subsequent 4 week randomised withdrawal phase of the \n\nstudy (Phase 2), the effect of aliskiren overlapped with the effects observed in patients switched to \n\nplacebo in all dose groups (low, p=0.8894; mid, p=0.9511; high, p=0.0563). The average differences \n\nbetween aliskiren and placebo for the low and mid dose groups were <0.2 mmHg. The treatment with \n\naliskiren was well tolerated in this study. \n\n \n\nThis study was extended with a 52-week double-blind, randomised study to evaluate the safety, \n\ntolerability and efficacy of aliskiren compared to enalapril in 208 paediatric hypertensive patients aged \n\n6 to 17 years (at baseline in the previous study). The starting dose in each group was assigned \n\ndepending on weight with three groups: ≥20 to <50 kg, ≥50 to <80 kg, and ≥80 to ≤150 kg. The \n\nstarting doses for aliskiren were 37.5/75/150 mg in the low, mid and high weight groups, respectively. \n\nThe starting doses for enalapril were 2.5/5/10 mg in the low, mid and high weight groups, \n\nrespectively. Optional titration of the respective study drug doses to the next highest weight-based \n\ndose level was available by doubling the dose with each of the two allowed dose titrations, up to \n\n600 mg (highest studied dose in adults) for aliskiren and 40 mg for enalapril in the ≥80 to ≤150 kg \n\nweight group, if medically necessary to control the mean sitting systolic blood pressure (i.e. msSBP \n\nshould be less than the 90th percentile for age, gender and height). Overall, the mean age of the \n\npatients was 11.8 years with 48.6% of patients being in the 6-11 years age group and 51.4% in the \n\n12-17 years age group. Mean weight was 68.0 kg with 57.7% of patients having BMI greater than or \n\nequal to the 95th percentile for age and gender. At the end of this extension study, changes in msSBP \n\nfrom baseline were similar with aliskiren compared to enalapril (-7.63 mmHg vs. -7.94 mmHg) in the \n\nfull analysis set. However, the significance of the non-inferiority testing was not maintained when the \n\nanalysis was performed on the per-protocol set in which the least square mean change in msSBP from \n\nbaseline was -7.84 mmHg with aliskiren and -9.04 mmHg with enalapril. In addition, due to the \n\npossibility of up-titration if medically necessary to control the msSBP, no conclusion can be drawn on \n\nthe appropriate posology of aliskiren in patients aged 6 to 17 years. \n\n \n\nAfter the first 52 week extension study, eligible male and female paediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years \n\nwith primary or secondary hypertension, were enrolled in a 52 to 104 week off-therapy non-\n\ninterventional observational extension study designed to evaluate the LT growth and development, \n\nthrough height and weight measurement, with added neurocognitive and renal function evaluations as \n\nfollow-up measures performed only in patients with secondary hypertension (19 patients: 9 previously \n\ntreated with aliskiren and  10 previously treated with enalapril). \n\n \n\nThere were no statistically significant differences in the mean changes in weight, height, or BMI \n\nbetween the treatment groups from Baseline to LT Visit 18 (Week 104) (primary analysis). \n\n \n\nIn patients after 104 weeks (at LT Visit 19 [Week 156]), there were LS mean decreases from Baseline \n\nin weight and BMI in both treatment groups, with a slightly larger decrease in the aliskiren compared \n\nto the enalapril treatment group.  \n\n \n\nThere was a greater LS mean increase from Baseline in height after 104 weeks (at LT Visit 19 [Week \n\n156], secondary hypertension patients) compared to the increase observed after 52 weeks (at LT Visit \n\n18 [Week 104], primary hypertension patients), which is expected in these growing paediatric patients.  \n\n \n\nResults of the neurocognitive assessments showed some improvements in most of the test scores, with \n\nno meaningful difference between the treatment groups. \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit results of studies with Rasilez \n\nHCT in all subsets of the paediatric population in essential hypertension (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAliskiren \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFollowing oral absorption, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached after 1-3 hours. The \n\nabsolute bioavailability of aliskiren is approximately 2-3%. Meals with a high fat content reduce Cmax \n\nby 85% and AUC by 70%. At steady state meals with low fat content reduce Cmax by 76% and AUC0-\n\ntau by 67% in hypertensive patients. However the efficacy of aliskiren was similar when taken with a \n\nlight meal or under fasted state. Steady-state-plasma concentrations are reached within 5-7 days \n\nfollowing once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 2-fold greater than with \n\nthe initial dose. \n\n \nTransporters \n\nMDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and \n\nbiliary excretion of aliskiren in pre-clinical studies. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately \n\n135 litres, indicating that aliskiren distributes extensively into the extravascular space. Aliskiren \n\nplasma protein binding is moderate (47-51%) and independent of the concentration. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nThe mean half-life is about 40 hours (range 34-41 hours). Aliskiren is mainly eliminated as unchanged \n\ncompound in the faeces (oral radioactive dose recovery = 91%). Approximately 1.4% of the total oral \n\ndose is metabolised. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP3A4. Approximately 0.6% of \n\nthe dose is recovered in urine following oral administration. Following intravenous administration, the \n\nmean plasma clearance is approximately 9 l/h. \n\n \n\nLinearity \n\nExposure to aliskiren increased slightly more than in proportion to the increase in dose. After single \n\ndose administration in the dose range of 75 to 600 mg, a 2-fold increase in dose results in a ~2.3 and \n\n2.6-fold increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively. Mechanisms responsible for the deviation from dose \n\nproportionality have not been identified. A possible mechanism is saturation of transporters at the \n\nabsorption site or at the hepatobiliary clearance route. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn a pharmacokinetic study of aliskiren treatment in 39 paediatric hypertensive patients aged 6 to \n\n17 years given daily doses of 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg aliskiren administered as granules (3.125 mg/tablet), \n\npharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those in adults. The results of this study did not suggest \n\nthat age, body weight or gender have any significant effect on aliskiren systemic exposure (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nIn an 8-week randomised, double-blind study with aliskiren monotherapy in 267 paediatric \n\nhypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years, mostly overweight/obese, fasting trough aliskiren \n\nconcentrations at day 28 were comparable to those observed in other studies in both adults and \n\nchildren using similar aliskiren doses. \n\n \n\nResults from an in vitro MDR1 human tissue study suggested an age and tissue dependent pattern of \n\nMDR1 (P-gp) transporter maturation. A high inter-individual variability of mRNA expression levels \n\nwas observed (up to 600-fold). Hepatic MDR1 mRNA expression was statistically significantly lower \n\nin samples from foetuses, neonates and infants up to 23 months. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nThe age at which the transporter system is mature cannot be determined. There is a potential for \n\naliskiren overexposure in children with an immature MDR1 (P-gp) system (see section “Transporters” \n\nabove and sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe absorption of hydrochlorothiazide, after an oral dose, is rapid (Tmax about 2 h). The increase in \n\nmean AUC is linear and dose proportional in the therapeutic range. \n\n \n\nThe effect of food on hydrochlorothiazide absorption, if any, has little clinical significance. Absolute \n\nbioavailability of hydrochlorothiazide is 70% after oral administration. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe apparent volume of distribution is 4-8 l/kg. Circulating hydrochlorothiazide is bound to serum \n\nproteins (40-70%), mainly serum albumin. Hydrochlorothiazide also accumulates in erythrocytes at \n\napproximately 3 times the level in plasma. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation and elimination \n\nHydrochlorothiazide is eliminated predominantly as unchanged compound. Hydrochlorothiazide is \n\neliminated from plasma with a half-life averaging 6 to 15 hours in the terminal elimination phase. \n\nThere is no change in the kinetics of hydrochlorothiazide on repeated dosing, and accumulation is \n\nminimal when dosed once daily. There is more than 95% of the absorbed dose being excreted as \n\nunchanged compound in the urine. The renal clearance is composed of passive filtration and active \n\nsecretion into the renal tubule. \n\n \n\nAliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\nFollowing oral administration of Rasilez HCT tablets, the median peak plasma concentration time is \n\nwithin 1 hour for aliskiren and 2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n \n\nThe rate and extent of absorption of Rasilez HCT are equivalent to the bioavailability of aliskiren and \n\nhydrochlorothiazide when administered as individual monotherapies. Similar food effect was observed \n\nfor Rasilez HCT as for the individual monotherapies. \n\n \n\nCharacteristics in patients \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT has been shown to be effective as a once-a-day antihypertensive treatment in adult \n\npatients, regardless of gender, age, body mass index and ethnicity. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren are not significantly affected in patients with mild to moderate liver \n\ndisease. Consequently, no initial dose adjustment of Rasilez HCT is required in patients with mild to \n\nmoderate hepatic impairment. No data are available on patients with severe hepatic impairment treated \n\nby Rasilez HCT. Rasilez HCT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \n\nsection 4.3). \n\n \n\nNo adjustment of the initial dose is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see \n\nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In the presence of renal impairment, mean peak plasma levels and AUC values \n\nof hydrochlorothiazide are increased and the urinary excretion rate is reduced. In patients with mild to \n\nmoderate renal impairment, a 3-fold increase in hydrochlorothiazide AUC has been observed. In \n\npatients with severe renal impairment an 8-fold increase in AUC has been observed. \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of aliskiren were evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease receiving \n\nhaemodialysis. Administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg aliskiren was associated with very \n\nminor changes in the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren (change in Cmax of less than 1.2 fold; increase in \n\nAUC of up to 1.6 fold) compared to matched healthy subjects. Timing of haemodialysis did not \n\nsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren in ESRD patients. Therefore, if administration of \n\n\n\n25 \n\naliskiren in ESRD patients receiving haemodialysis is considered necessary, no dose adjustment is \n\nwarranted in these patients. However, the use of aliskiren is not recommended in patients with severe \n\nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nNo initial dose adjustment of Rasilez HCT is required in elderly patients. Limited data suggest that the \n\nsystemic clearance of hydrochlorothiazide is reduced in both healthy and hypertensive elderly subjects \n\ncompared to young healthy volunteers. \n\n \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data on Rasilez HCT are available in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nSafety pharmacology studies with aliskiren did not reveal any adverse effects on central nervous, \n\nrespiratory or cardiovascular function. Findings during repeat-dose toxicity studies in animals were \n\nconsistent with the known local (gastrointestinal tract) irritation potential or the expected \n\npharmacological effects of aliskiren. \n\n \n\nNo carcinogenic potential for aliskiren was detected in a 2-year rat study and a 6-month transgenic \n\nmouse study. One colonic adenoma and one caecal adenocarcinoma recorded in rats at the dose of \n\n1500 mg/kg/day were not statistically significant. \n\n \n\nAlthough aliskiren has known local (gastrointestinal tract) irritation potential, safety margins obtained \n\nin humans at the dose of 300 mg during a study in healthy volunteers were considered to be appropriate \n\nat 9-11-fold based on faecal concentrations or 6-fold based on mucosa concentrations in comparison \n\nwith 250 mg/kg/day in the rat carcinogenicity study. \n\n \n\nAliskiren was devoid of any mutagenic potential in the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity studies. \n\n \n\nReproductive toxicity studies with aliskiren did not reveal any evidence of embryofoetal toxicity or \n\nteratogenicity at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day in rats or 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits. Fertility, pre-natal \n\ndevelopment and post-natal development were unaffected in rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day. The \n\ndoses in rats and rabbits provided systemic exposures of 1 to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively, than the \n\nmaximum recommended human dose (300 mg). \n\n \n\nPreclinical evaluations to support the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in humans included in \n\nvitro genotoxicity assays and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Extensive \n\nclinical data are available for hydrochlorothiazide and these are reflected in the relevant sections. \n\n \n\nThe findings observed in the 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were consistent with those observed \n\npreviously with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapies. There were no new or unexpected \n\nfindings observed of relevance to human use. Increased cellular vacuolation of the adrenal gland zona \n\nglomerulosa was observed during the 13-week toxicity study in rats. The finding was observed in \n\nanimals treated with hydrochlorothiazide but not in those animals receiving aliskiren alone or vehicle. \n\nThere was no evidence that this finding was enhanced in the aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide \n\ncombination as it was only apparent at a minimal severity in all animals. \n\n \n\nJuvenile animal studies \n\nIn a juvenile toxicity study in 8-day-old rats, aliskiren administration at 100 mg/kg/day and \n\n300 mg/kg/day (2.3- and 6.8-fold the maximum recommended human dose) was associated with high \n\nmortality and severe morbidity. In another juvenile toxicity study in 14-day old rats, aliskiren \n\nadministration at 300 mg/kg/day (8.5-fold the maximum recommended human dose) was associated \n\nwith delayed mortality. The systemic exposure to aliskiren in 8-day old rats was >400-fold higher than \n\nin adult rats. Results from a mechanistic study showed that the MDR1 (P-gp) gene expression in \n\njuvenile rats was significantly lower when compared to adult rats. The increased aliskiren exposure in \n\njuvenile rats appears to be attributed mainly to lack of maturation of P-gp in the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThere is therefore a potential for aliskiren overexposure in paediatric patients with immature MDR1 \n\nefflux system (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Rasilez HCT is and what is it used for \n\n \n\nWhat Rasilez HCT is \n\nThis medicine contains two active substances, called aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide. Both of these \n\nactive substances help to control high blood pressure (hypertension). \n\n \n\nAliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It reduces the amount of angiotensin II the body can make. \n\nAngiotensin II causes blood vessels to tighten, which makes blood pressure higher. Lowering the \n\namount of angiotensin II allows the blood vessels to relax; this lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nHydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide \n\nincreases urine output, which also lowers blood pressure. \n\n \n\nThis helps to lower high blood pressure in adult patients. High blood pressure increases the workload \n\nof the heart and arteries. If this continues for a long time, it can damage the blood vessels of the brain, \n\nheart and kidneys, and may result in a stroke, heart failure, heart attack or kidney failure. Lowering the \n\nblood pressure to a normal level reduces the risk of developing these disorders. \n\n \n\nWhat Rasilez HCT is used for \n\nThis medicine is used to treat high blood pressure in adult patients. It is used in patients whose blood \n\npressure is not adequately controlled by aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide taken alone. It can also be \n\nused in patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide \n\ntaken as separate tablets, to replace the same doses of the two active substances. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Rasilez HCT \n\n \n\nDo not take Rasilez HCT \n\n- if you are allergic to aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide, to sulfonamide-derived medicines \n\n\n\n94 \n\n(medicines used to treat chest or urinary infections) or to any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n\n- if you have experienced the following forms of angioedema (difficulties in breathing or \nswallowing, or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue): \n\n- angioedema when taking aliskiren. \n- hereditary angioedema. \n- angioedema without any known cause. \n\n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. It is also better to avoid this medicine in early \npregnancy – see section ‘Pregnancy’. \n\n- if you have serious liver or serious kidney problems. \n- if you are unable to produce urine (anuria). \n- if the level of potassium in your blood is too low despite treatment. \n- if the level of sodium in your blood is too low. \n- if the level of calcium in your blood is too high. \n- if you have gout (uric acid crystals in the joints). \n- if you are taking ciclosporin (a medicine used in transplantation to prevent organ rejection or for \n\nother conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), itraconazole (a medicine used to \n\ntreat fungal infections) or quinidine (a medicine used to correct heart rhythm). \n\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with either of the following \nclasses of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril \nor \n\n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan. \n- if the patient is less than 2 years of age. \n \n\nIf any of the above applies to you, do not take Rasilez HCT and talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Rasilez HCT: \n\n- if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase \n\nthe risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin \n\nfrom sun exposure and UV rays while taking Rasilez HCT. \n\n- if you have impaired kidney function, your doctor will carefully consider whether this medicine \nis suitable for you and may wish to monitor you carefully. \n\n- if you have had a kidney transplant. \n- if you suffer from liver problems. \n- if you suffer from heart problems. \n- if you have already experienced angioedema (difficulties in breathing or swallowing, or \n\nswelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue). If this happens, stop taking this \n\nmedicine and contact your doctor. \n\n- if you have diabetes (high level of sugar in your blood). \n- if you have a high level of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood. \n- if you suffer from a disease called lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”). \n- if you suffer from allergy or asthma. \n- if you are taking either of the following classes of medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril \n\nor \n\n- an angiotensin II receptor blocker such as valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan. \n\n- if you are on a low-salt diet. \n- if you have signs and symptoms such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, \n\ndrowsiness, muscle pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which \n\nmay indicate an excessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide. \n\n- if you experience skin reactions such as rash after sun exposure. \n- if you experience a decrease in vision or eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid \n\naccumulation in the vascular layer of the eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in \n\nyour eye and can happen within hours to a week of taking Rasilez HCT. This can lead to \n\n\n\n95 \n\npermanent vision loss, if not treated. If you earlier have had a penicillin or sulfonamide allergy, \n\nyou can be at higher risk of developing this. \n\n- if you have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n- if you have serious congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump \n\nenough blood around the body). \n\n \n\nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. \n\npotassium) in your blood at regular intervals. \n\n \n\nSee also section “Do not take Rasilez HCT”. \n\n \n\nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Rasilez HCT is not \n\nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \n\nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see section “Pregnancy”). \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThis medicine must not be used in babies from birth to less than 2 years of age. It should not be used \n\nin children from 2 to less than 6 years of age, and is not recommended for use in children and \n\nadolescents from 6 to less than 18 years of age. This is because the safety and benefits of this medicine \n\nare not known in this population.  \n\n \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nThe usual recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients aged 65 years or older is 150 mg. \n\nIn the majority of patients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional \n\nbenefit in reducing blood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Rasilez HCT \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are using the following medicines: \n\n- lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression). \n- medicines or substances that increase the amount of potassium in your blood. These include \n\npotassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing medicines \n\nand heparin. \n\n- medicines that may reduce the amount of potassium in your blood, such as diuretics (water \ntablets), corticosteroids, laxatives, carbenoxolone, amphotericin or penicillin G. \n\n- medicines that may induce “torsades de pointes” (irregular heart beat), such as antiarrhythmics \n(medicines used to treat heart problems) and some antipsychotics. \n\n- medicines that may reduce the amount of sodium in your blood, such as antidepressants, \nantipsychotics, antiepileptics (carbamazepine). \n\n- pain killers such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including selective \ncyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (Cox-2 inhibitors). \n\n- medicines to reduce blood pressure, including methyldopa, an angiotensin II receptor blocker or \nan angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (see sections  “Do not take Rasilez HCT” and \n\n“Warnings and precautions”). \n\n- medicines to increase blood pressure, such as noradrenaline or adrenaline. \n- digoxin or other digitalis glycosides (medicines used to treat heart problems). \n- vitamin D and calcium salts. \n- medicines for the treatment of diabetes (oral agents such as metformin or insulins). \n- medicines that may increase blood sugar level, such as beta blockers and diazoxide. \n- medicines for the treatment of gout, such as allopurinol. \n- anticholinergic agents (medicines used to treat a variety of disorders such as gastrointestinal \n\ncramps, urinary bladder spasm, asthma, motion sickness, muscular spasms, Parkinson's disease \n\nand as an aid to anaesthesia). \n\n\n\n96 \n\n- amantadine (a medicine used to treat Parkinson’s disease, also used to treat or prevent certain \nillnesses caused by viruses). \n\n- cholestyramine, colestipol or other resins (substances used mainly to treat high levels of lipids \nin the blood). \n\n- cytotoxic medicines (used to treat cancer), such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. \n- muscle relaxants (medicines to relax the muscles which are used during operations). \n- alcohol, sleeping pills and anaesthetics (medicines allowing patients to undergo surgery and \n\nother procedures). \n\n- iodine contrast media (agents used for imaging examinations). \n- arthritis medicines. \n \n\nYour doctor may need to change your dose and/or take other precautions if you are taking one \n\nof the following medicines: \n\n- furosemide or torasemide, medicines belonging to the type known as diuretics, or water tablets, \nwhich are used to increase the amount of urine you produce. \n\n- some medicines used to treat infections, such as ketoconazole. \n- verapamil, a medicine used to lower high blood pressure, to correct heart rhythm or to treat \n\nangina pectoris. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT with food and drink \n\nYou should take this medicine either with a light meal or without a meal, once a day, preferably at the \n\nsame time each day. You should avoid taking this medicine together with fruit juice and/or drinks \n\ncontaining plant extracts (including herbal teas), as it could cause a decrease in the effectiveness of \n\nthis medicine  \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant (see section ‘Do not take Rasilez HCT’). If you become \n\npregnant while taking this medicine stop taking it immediately and talk to your doctor. If you think \n\nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before \n\ntaking this medicine. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking this medicine before you \n\nbecome pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of this medicine. It is not \n\nrecommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \n\ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. This medicine is not \n\nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for \n\nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nThis medicine may make you feel dizzy. If you experience this symptom, do not drive or use tools or \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT contains lactose and wheat starch (containing gluten) \n\nThis medicine contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nThis medicinecontains wheat starch.  Wheat starch in this medicine contains only very low levels of \n\ngluten and is very unlikely to cause problems if you have coeliac disease. One dosage unit contains no \n\nmore than 100 micrograms of gluten. If you have wheat allergy (different from coeliac disease) you \n\nshould not take this medicine. You should consult your doctor prior to taking this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Rasilez HCT \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \n\nif you are not sure. \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nRasilez HCT may have been prescribed to you because your previous treatment with a medicine \n\ncontaining one of the active components of Rasilez HCT did not lower your blood pressure enough. If \n\nthis is the case, your doctor will tell you how to switch from that treatment to Rasilez HCT. \n\n \n\nThe usual dose of Rasilez HCT is one tablet a day. The blood pressure lowering effect is present \n\nwithin one week after beginning treatment. \n\n \n\nElderly people \n\nThe usual recommended starting dose of aliskiren in elderly patients is 150 mg. In the majority of \n\npatients aged 65 years or older, the 300 mg dose of aliskiren shows no additional benefit in reducing \n\nblood pressure compared to the 150 mg dose. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nSwallow the tablet whole with some water. You should take this medicine once a day, always with or \n\nalways without food, preferably at the same time each day. You should establish a convenient daily \n\nschedule to take the medicine the same way each day, in a regular pattern with respect to the timing of \n\nyour meals. You should avoid taking this medicine together with fruit juice and/or drinks containing \n\nplant extracts (including herbal teas). During your treatment, your doctor may adjust your dose \n\ndepending on your blood pressure response. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Rasilez HCT than you should \n\nIf you have accidentally taken too many tablets of this medicine, talk to a doctor immediately. You \n\nmay require medical attention. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take Rasilez HCT \n\nIf you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember and then take the next \n\ndose at its usual time. If you only remember the forgotten dose the next day, you should simply take \n\nthe next tablet at the usual time. Do not take a double dose (two tablets at once) to make up for a \n\nforgotten tablet. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking Rasilez HCT \n\nDo not stop taking this medicine, even if you are feeling well unless your doctor tells you to do so. \n\nPeople who have high blood pressure often do not notice any signs of the problem. Many may feel \n\nquite normal. It is very important that you take this medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to get the \n\nbest results and reduce the risk of side effects. Keep your appointments with the doctor even if you are \n\nfeeling well. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nSome side effects can be serious: \n\nA few patients have experienced these serious side effects. If any of the following occur, tell your \n\ndoctor straight away: \n\n• Severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction), allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) and \nangioedema (the symptoms of which can include difficulties in breathing or swallowing, rash, \n\nitching, hives or swelling of the face, hands and feet, eyes, lips and/or tongue, dizziness).
