NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHUMENZA suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H1N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nHUMENZA consists of two vials: one vial containing the antigen (suspension) and one vial containing \nthe adjuvant (emulsion), which are mixed prior to administration. \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus*, inactivated containing antigen equivalent to: \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like strain (NYMC X-179A).......................................3.8 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** expressed in microgram haemagglutinin \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nAF03 adjuvant composed of squalene (12.4 milligrams), sorbitan oleate (1.9 milligrams), \npolyoxyethylene cetostearyl ether (2.4 milligrams) and mannitol (2.3 milligrams)  \n \nThe suspension and emulsion, once mixed, form a multidose vaccine in a vial. See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n \nExcipients: \nThe vaccine contains 11.3 micrograms thiomersal. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe antigen is a colourless limpid to opalescent suspension.  \nThe adjuvant is a white opaque emulsion.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). \n \nPandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nIn the different age groups, there are limited data (adults aged 18 to 60 years), very limited data (adults \naged 61 years and over, children aged 6 months to 17 years) or no data (children aged less than 6 \nmonths) with HUMENZA as detailed in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n3 \n\nChildren from 3 years of age, adolescents and adults up to 60 years of age:  \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of Humenza in clinical studies \nsuggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand the second dose. \n \nElderly above 60 years of age: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. \n \nChildren from 6 months of age to less than 3 years of age: \nOne half-dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date. \nImmunogenicity data obtained in a limited number of children aged 6-35 months show that there is a \nfurther immune response to a second half-dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval of three \nweeks. \nThe use of a second half-dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, \n4.8 and 5.1.  \n \nChildren below 6 months of age: \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. \n \nFor further information, see section 5.1. \n \nIt is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of HUMENZA, complete the vaccination \ncourse with HUMENZA (see section 4.4). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection (IM) preferably into the deltoid muscle \nor anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \nFor instructions for preparation, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde). If vaccination is \nconsidered to be necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need. \n \nSee section 4.4. for Special warnings and special precautions for use. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal, and to \nresidues (ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nHUMENZA should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n4 \n\nThere are no data with HUMENZA using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers \nneed to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with \nthrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless \nthe potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nThere are no data on administration of AF03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nVery limited data in children aged 6 to 35 months (N=96) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of \nthe adult dose) with an interval of 3 weeks between doses indicate an increase in the rates of injection \nsite reactions and general symptoms (see section 4.8.). In particular rates of fever (axillary temperature \n≥38°C) may increase considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and \nmeasures to lower fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are \nrecommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 8 years of age) after each vaccination. \n \nThere are very limited safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with \nHUMENZA in adults aged over 60 years of age. \n \nThere are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of HUMENZA \nwith other H1N1 pandemic vaccines.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of HUMENZA with other vaccines. However, if \nco-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate \nlimbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nNo data have been generated in pregnant or lactating women with the vaccine HUMENZA or with any \nother vaccine containing adjuvant AF03. \n \nA reproductive and developmental toxicity study conducted in rabbits with HUMENZA showed no \neffects on embryo fetal development. \n \nThe use of HUMENZA may be considered during pregnancy and lactation if this is thought to be \nnecessary, taking into account official recommendations. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive \nor use machines. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n• Clinical trials \n \nAdults and elderly: \n \nIn an open-label clinical trial, two doses (0.5 ml) of HUMENZA have been administered at a 3-week \ninterval in 153 subjects (99 adults and 54 elderly).  \n \nLocal and systemic reactions occurred within 7 days following any vaccine administration. These \nreactions were usually resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. The severity of these \nreactions was from grade 1 (mild) to grade 2 (moderate). The rate of grade 3 (severe) reactions was \noverall low (≤ 2%).  \n \nThe most frequent reaction was injection site pain.  \n \nOverall, reactions were more frequent in adults than in elderly and less frequent after the second dose \nin both age groups. \n \nAdverse reactions reported following any vaccination are listed below according to the following \nfrequency: \n \nVery common (≥1/10) \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nNervous system disorders \n- Very common: headache \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n- Very common: myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n- Very common: injection site pain \n- Common: malaise, shivering, fever, injection site reactions such as induration, erythema, \n\nswelling, ecchymosis. \n \nChildren and adolescent (from 3 to 17 years of age): \nIn an open-label clinical trial, two doses (0.5 ml) of HUMENZA have been administered at a 3-week \ninterval in 50 children from 3 to 8 years of age and 49 adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age. The \nsafety has been assessed after each administration. \n \nOverall, reactions were more frequent in children and adolescents than in adults and elderly. \n \nLocal and systemic reactions occurred within 7 days following any vaccine administration. These \nreactions were usually resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days after onset. \n \nThe severity of the local and systemic reactions was mainly from grade 1 (mild) to grade 2 (moderate). \nThe rate of grade 3 (severe) reactions was overall low (from 2 to 14% in children from 3 to 8 years of \nage and from 2 to 8.2% in adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age).  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n6 \n\nIn children from 3 to 8 years of age, the most frequent reactions were injection site pain and injection \nsite erythema. Overall, a higher frequency of injection site reactions and fever was reported in this age \ngroup compared to the adolescents. Moreover, a higher frequency of fever and headache was reported \nafter the second dose than after the first dose.  \n \nIn adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age, the most frequent reactions were injection site pain and \nheadache.

Groups of 7 ferrets were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with one human dose \nof HUMENZA (3.8 µg of HA and full dose AF03) (at D21) or 2-dose administration of one human \ndose at 3-week intervals (at D0 and D21) and compared to a control group (AF03 adjuvant diluted in \nPBS). Four weeks after the last vaccine administration, ferrets were challenged with the wild type \nhomologous strain A/H1N1/Netherlands/602/2009. \nA single administration of a human dose of HUMENZA elicited HI titers ≥ 80 and MN \n(Microneutralization) titers ≥ 160 specific to the vaccinal strain in 100% of vaccinated animals and a \ntwo-dose administration regimen markedly increased (at least a 5-fold increase) HI and MN antibody \ntiters. A mean body weight loss of 20% was recorded in control group 4 days after infection. This \nbody weight loss was reduced to ≤ 8% in animals that received 1 or 2 doses of HUMENZA. Four days \nafter challenge, in the control group, 34% of the lungs were affected and presented lung lesions \nassociated with high levels of virus replication in lung tissue (≥ 4.7 TCID50/g tissue).  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n13 \n\nIn ferrets administered with one or two doses of HUMENZA, a significant reduction of lung damages \n(4 % or 1 % of affected lung, respectively) and of lung viral loads (more than 4 log10 reduction) was \nachieved resulting in 86% (6 out of 7 ferrets) or 100% of ferrets with no detectable virus in lungs, \nrespectively. The protection against infection in the lungs was associated with vaccine-induced HI \ntiters ≥ 40, a titer described in humans to be associated with protection against seasonal influenza. \nViral shedding was assessed by measuring viral replication in both nasal and throat swabs and results \ndemonstrated that HUMENZA was able to consistently reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory \ntract. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAvailable non clinical data obtained with the vaccine HUMENZA or with the same vaccine but with \nanother strain (A/H5N1) revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional  repeat dose \ntoxicity studies, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies and an investigative \npneumopathology study.  \n \nRepeated injections of the vaccine induced moderate local inflammation in rabbits and no exacerbation \nof pneumonia after exposure to the parental wild-type virus in monkeys.  Rabbits dosed with vaccine, \nor with AF03 adjuvant alone, showed a slight increase of apoptosis / necrosis in the lachrymal tissues \nat doses higher than the human dose. Rabbits dams dosed with vaccine pre-mating and during \ngestation did not show any effects on embryofetal development. \n \nThe adjuvant, AF03, was not mutagenic or clastogenic and induced transient inflammatory changes in \nrepeat dose toxicity studies (in rats and rabbits). The reproductive and developmental toxicity studies \nconducted in rats and rabbits with AF03 did not show any effects on female fertility, pregnancy, \nembryofetal development or early postnatal development. \n \n6.

CONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION \n \n• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE IMPOSED ON \n\nTHE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nMedicinal product subject to medical prescription. \n \nHUMENZA can only be marketed when there is an official WHO/EU declaration of an influenza \npandemic, on the condition that the Marketing Authorisation Holder for HUMENZA takes due \naccount of the officially declared pandemic strain. \n \n• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND \n\nEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n• The MAH shall agree with Member States to measures facilitating the identification and \n\ntraceability of the A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine administered to each patient, in order to minimise \nmedication errors and aid patients and health care professionals to report adverse reactions. This \nmay include the provision by the MAH of stickers with invented name and batch number with \neach pack of the vaccine. \n\n• The MAH shall agree with Member States on mechanisms allowing patients and health care \nprofessionals to have continuous access to updated information regarding HUMENZA. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n18 \n\n• The MAH shall agree with Member Sates on the provision of a targeted communication to \nhealthcare professionals which should address the following: \n• The correct way to prepare the vaccine prior to administration. \n• Adverse events to be prioritised for reporting, i.e. fatal and life-threatening adverse \n\nreactions, unexpected severe adverse reactions, adverse events of special interest (AESI). \n• The minimal data elements to be transmitted in individual case safety reports in order to \n\nfacilitate the evaluation and the identification of the vaccine administered to each subject, \nincluding the invented name, the vaccine manufacturer and the batch number. \n\n• If a specific notification system has been put in place, how to report adverse reactions. \n \n• OTHER CONDITIONS \n \nOfficial batch release: in accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the \nofficial batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that \npurpose. \n \nPharmacovigilance system \nThe MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 10.0 \npresented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and \nfunctioning before the product is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product \nremains in use. \n \nPSUR submission during the influenza pandemic: \n \nDuring a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified \nin Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a \npandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time. Such \nsituation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for \nbenefit-risk balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of the \nextent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be \nvaccinated. The MAH shall submit on a monthly basis a simplified periodic safety update report with \nthe timelines, format and content as defined in the CHMP Recommendations for the \nPharmacovigilance Plan as part of the Risk Management Plan to be submitted with the Marketing \nAuthorisation Application for a Pandemic Influenza Vaccine (EMA/359381/2009) and any subsequent \nupdate. \n \nRisk Management Plan \nThe MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities \ndetailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 7.0 of the Risk Management Plan \n(RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any \nsubsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. \n \n \nC. SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS TO BE FULFILLED BY THE MARKETING \n\nAUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nThe Marketing Authorisation Holder shall complete the following programme of studies within the \nspecified time frame, the results of which shall form the basis of the annual reassessment of the \nbenefit/risk profile. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n19 \n\nClinical Independently of the cohort safety study (9,000 subjects), \nthe MAH commits to implement a post-licensure \nprospective clinical safety study (N=3,000 subjects from 6 \nmonths of age). \nThe RMP will be updated accordingly to reflect this study \nwithin 15 calendar days of the receipt of the opinion. \n\nInitiation of the \nstudy by July \n2010 \n \n\nPharmacovigilance The MAH commits to update the observational study \nprotocol to screen for auto-antibodies those patients \npresenting visual or ocular events during the study follow-\nup. \n\nProspective \ncohort safety \nstudy protocol \nupdate to be \nsubmitted within \none week of \nCommission \nDecision \ngranting \nMarketing \nAuthorization. \n\nPharmacovigilance The MAH commits to submit the data from pregnancy \nregistry as described in the RMP. \n\nResults to be \nprovided in the \nsimplified PSUR. \n\nPharmacovigilance The MAH will submit the results of a prospective cohort \nsafety study in at least 9,000 patients in different age \ngroups, including immunocompromised subjects, in \naccordance with the protocol submitted with the Risk \nManagement Plan. \n \n\nInterim and final \nresults will be \nsubmitted in \naccordance with \nthe protocol. \n\nPharmacovigilance The MAH commits to present a plan for the definition of the \nsources to collect safety data on immunocompromised \npatient within the prospective cohort safety study. \n \n\nProspective \ncohort safety \nstudy protocol \nupdate to be \nsubmitted within \none week of \nCommission \nDecision \ngranting \nMarketing \nAuthorization. \n \n\nPharmacovigilance The MAH will submit the results of the GBS surveillance \nstudy. \n \n\nInterim and final \nresults will be \nsubmitted in \naccordance with \nthe protocol. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX III \n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor. \n \n \nIn this leaflet: \n1. What HUMENZA is and what it is used for \n2. Before you receive HUMENZA \n3. How HUMENZA is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store HUMENZA \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT HUMENZA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nHUMENZA is a vaccine to prevent pandemic influenza (flu).  \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around \nthe world. The symptoms (signs) of pandemic flu are similar to those of an ordinary flu but may be \nmore severe. \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU RECEIVE HUMENZA \n \nYou should not receive HUMENZA: \n- if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nHUMENZA (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be \npresent in trace amounts as follows: ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, neomycin, \noctoxinol-9, formaldehyde. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness \nof breath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be \nappropriate for you to have the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is \nimmediately available in case of an allergic reaction. \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n33 \n\nTake special care with HUMENZA: \n- if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, ovalbumin, egg and chicken proteins, \nneomycin, octoxinol-9, formaldehyde (see section 6. Further information). \n\n- if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with HUMENZA, \n\n- if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with HUMENZA the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell \nthe doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given HUMENZA. \n\n- as with all vaccines, HUMENZA may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nChildren below 6 months of age: \nHUMENZA is not recommended in children below 6 months of age.  \n \nTaking other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. \n \nThere is no information on administration of the vaccine HUMENZA with other vaccines. \nHowever, if this cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, \nyou should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant or if you are \nbreastfeeding. You should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive HUMENZA. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4 “Possible side effects” may affect the ability to drive or \nuse machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of HUMENZA \nThis medicine contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an \nallergic reaction. Tell the doctor if you have any known allergies. \n \n \n3. HOW HUMENZA IS GIVEN \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. \n \nThe vaccine will be injected into a muscle, preferably in the upper arm or the front of the thigh \n(depending on the muscle mass).  \n \nChildren from 3 years of age, adolescents and adults up to 60 years of age:  \nOne dose of 0.5 ml of the vaccine will be given. \nClinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. \nIf a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first \nand second dose. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n34 \n\nElderly above 60 years of age: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml of the vaccine will be given. \nA second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \n \nChildren from 6 months to less than 3 years of age: \nOne half-dose of 0.25 ml of the vaccine will be given. \nIf a second dose of 0.25 ml is given, this will be administered at least three weeks after the first dose.  \n \nChildren below 6 months of age: \nVaccination is currently not recommended in this age group \n \nWhen HUMENZA is given for the first dose, it is recommended that HUMENZA (and not another \nvaccine against H1N1) be given for the complete vaccination course. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, HUMENZA can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \nVery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n \nDuring a clinical study conducted with HUMENZA in adults and elderly, the side effects listed below \nhave been observed. \nVery common: headache, muscular pain, injection site pain. \nCommon: feeling generally unwell, shivering, fever. At the injection site: hardness, redness, swelling, \nbruising. \n \nDuring clinical studies conducted with HUMENZA in children and adolescents, the side effects listed \nbelow have been observed. \nAdolescent from 9 to 17 years old: \nVery common: headache, feeling generally unwell, muscular pain, shivering. At the injection site: \npain, redness, swelling, hardness. \nCommon: fever, sore throat, injection site bruising. \n \nChildren from 3 to 8 years old: \nVery common: feeling generally unwell, muscular pain, headache, shivering, fever.

Before extemporaneous mix, the two vials (antigen and adjuvant) should be allowed to reach \n\nroom temperature and must be gently swirled between hands and inspected visually for any \nforeign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being \nobserved (including rubber particles from the stopper), the vaccine should be discarded. \n\n2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing with a sterile syringe and needle the entire content of the \nantigen vial and adding it into the adjuvant vial. \n\n3. After the addition of the antigen to the adjuvant, the mixture should be gently shaken by at least \n5 rotating movements. After mixing, the vaccine is a white opaque emulsion. \n\n4. The volume of HUMENZA after mixing is at least 6 ml and allows the withdrawal of several \ndoses (multidose vial). For the dose to be administered, see recommended posology in section 3 \n“How HUMENZA is given”. \n\n5. After mixing HUMENZA should be stored in a refrigerator (2°C-8°C) (never place in the \nfreezer) and should be used within 24 hours. \n\n6. To facilitate tracking and timely disposal of partially used vials, it is suggested that the date and \nhour of mixing be clearly written on the label of adjuvant vial. \n\n \nInstructions for the administration of the vaccine: \n1. Before injection the vaccine should be allowed to reach room temperature by gently swirling the \n\nvial between hands (not more than 5 minutes). \n2. Prior to each administration, the multidose vial should be gently shaken by at least 5 rotating \n\nmovements. \n3. The content of the multidose vial as well as the content of the syringe after withdrawal should \n\nbe inspected visually. The vaccine is of a white opaque emulsion appearance. If deviations from \nthis description and/or any foreign particulate matter are observed (including rubber particles \nfrom the stopper), the vaccine should be discarded. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n \n39 \n\n4. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml or 0.25 ml (half-dose) is withdrawn with a new sterile syringe for \ninjection and administered intramuscularly. \n\n \nHUMENZA should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nA partially used multidose vial must be discarded immediately if: \n- Sterile dose withdrawal has not been fully observed. \n- There is any suspicion that the partially used vial has been contaminated. \n- There is visible evidence of contamination, such as change in appearance. \n \nIn order to keep the traceability of the product received by each vaccinee the name of the vaccine and \nthe lot number should be recorded by using the stickers provided in the pack containing both the \nantigen and adjuvant vials. \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
