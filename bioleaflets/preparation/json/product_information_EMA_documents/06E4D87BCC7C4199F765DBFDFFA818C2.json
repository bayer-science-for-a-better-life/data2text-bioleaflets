NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nIRESSA 250 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach tablet contains 250 mg of gefitinib.\n\nExcipients with known effect: \n\nEach tablet contains 163.5 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).\n\nEach tablet contains 3.86 mg of sodium.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablets (tablet).\n\nTablets are brown, round, biconvex, impressed with “IRESSA 250” on one side and plain on the other.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nIRESSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK (see section \n4.4).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with IRESSA should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanti-cancer therapies.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended posology of IRESSA is one 250 mg tablet once a day. If a dose is missed, it should \nbe taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is less than 12 hours to the next dose, the patient should \nnot take the missed dose. Patients should not take a double dose (two doses at the same time) to make \nup for a forgotten dose.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of IRESSA in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been \nestablished. There is no relevant use of gefitinib in the paediatric population in the indication of \nNSCLC.\n\n\n\nHepatic impairment\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) due to cirrhosis have \nincreased plasma concentrations of gefitinib. These patients should be closely monitored for adverse \nevents. Plasma concentrations were not increased in patients with elevated aspartate transaminase \n(AST), alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin due to liver metastases (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function at creatinine clearance \n> 20 ml/min. Only limited data are available in patients with creatinine clearance  20 ml/min and \ncaution is advised in these patients (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age (see section 5.2).\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers\nNo specific dose adjustment is recommended in patients with known CYP2D6 poor metaboliser \ngenotype, but these patients should be closely monitored for adverse events (see section 5.2).\n\nDose adjustment due to toxicity\nPatients with poorly tolerated diarrhoea or skin adverse reactions may be successfully managed by \nproviding a brief (up to 14 days) therapy interruption followed by reinstatement of the 250 mg dose \n(see section 4.8). For patients unable to tolerate treatment after a therapy interruption, gefitinib should \nbe discontinued and an alternative treatment should be considered.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe tablet may be taken orally with or without food, at about the same time each day. The tablet can be \nswallowed whole with some water or if dosing of whole tablets is not possible, tablets may be \nadministered as a dispersion in water (non-carbonated). No other liquids should be used. Without \ncrushing it, the tablet should be dropped in half a glass of drinking water. The glass should be swirled \noccasionally, until the tablet is dispersed (this may take up to 20 minutes). The dispersion should be \ndrunk immediately after dispersion is complete (i.e. within 60 minutes). The glass should be rinsed \nwith half a glass of water, which should also be drunk. The dispersion can also be administered \nthrough a naso-gastric or gastrostomy tube.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nWhen considering the use of IRESSA as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, it is \nimportant that EGFR mutation assessment of the tumour tissue is attempted for all patients. If a tumour \nsample is not evaluable, then circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) obtained from a blood (plasma) \nsample may be used.\n\n\n\nOnly robust, reliable and sensitive test(s) with demonstrated utility for the determination of EGFR \nmutation status of tumours or ctDNA should be used to avoid false negative or false positive \ndeterminations (see section 5.1).\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) which may be acute in onset, has been observed in 1.3% of patients \nreceiving gefitinib, and some cases have been fatal (see section 4.8). If patients experience worsening \nof respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, IRESSA should be interrupted and the \npatient should be promptly investigated. If ILD is confirmed, IRESSA should be discontinued and the \npatient treated appropriately.\n\nIn a Japanese pharmacoepidemiological case control study in 3,159 patients with NSCLC receiving \ngefitinib or chemotherapy who were followed up for 12 weeks, the following risk factors for \ndeveloping ILD (irrespective of whether the patient received IRESSA or chemotherapy) were \nidentified: smoking, poor performance status (PS ≥ 2), CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung \n(≤ 50%), recent diagnosis of NSCLC (< 6 months), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 55 years old) and\nconcurrent cardiac disease. An increased risk of ILD on gefitinib relative to chemotherapy was seen \npredominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment (adjusted OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.9 to 7.7); thereafter \nthe relative risk was lower (adjusted OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 5.8). Risk of mortality among patients who \ndeveloped ILD on IRESSA or chemotherapy was higher in patients with the following risk factors: \nsmoking, CT scan evidence of reduced normal lung (≤ 50%), pre-existing ILD, older age (≥ 65 years \nold), and extensive areas adherent to pleura (≥ 50%).\n\nHepatotoxicity and liver impairment\nLiver function test abnormalities (including increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate \naminotransferase, bilirubin) have been observed, uncommonly presenting as hepatitis (see section 4.8). \nThere have been isolated reports of hepatic failure which in some cases led to fatal outcomes. \nTherefore, periodic liver function testing is recommended. Gefitinib should be used cautiously in the \npresence of mild to moderate changes in liver function. Discontinuation should be considered if \nchanges are severe.\n\nImpaired liver function due to cirrhosis has been shown to lead to increased plasma concentrations of \ngefitinib (see section 5.2).\n\nInteractions with other medicinal products\nCYP3A4 inducers may increase metabolism of gefitinib and decrease gefitinib plasma concentrations. \nTherefore, concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, \nrifampicin, barbiturates or herbal preparations containing St John’s wort/Hypericum perforatum) may \nreduce efficacy of the treatment and should be avoided (see section 4.5).\n\nIn individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype, treatment with a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor might lead to increased plasma levels of gefitinib. At initiation of treatment with a CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, patients should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions (see section 4.5).\n\nInternational normalised ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some \npatients taking warfarin together with gefitinib (see section 4.5). Patients taking warfarin and gefitinib \nconcomitantly should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time (PT) or INR.\n\n\n\nMedicinal products that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH, such as proton-pump \ninhibitors and h2-antagonists may reduce bioavailability and plasma concentrations of gefitinib and, \ntherefore, may reduce efficacy. Antacids if taken regularly close in time to administration of gefitinib\nmay have a similar effect (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).\n\nData from phase II clinical trials, where gefitinib and vinorelbine have been used concomitantly, \nindicate that gefitinib may exacerbate the neutropenic effect of vinorelbine.\n\nLactose\nIRESSA contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n\nSodium\nIRESSA contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) of sodium per tablet, that is to say it is essentially \n‘sodium-free.’\n\nFurther precautions for use\nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if they experience severe or persistent \ndiarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or anorexia as these may indirectly lead to dehydration. These symptoms \nshould be managed as clinically indicated (see section 4.8).\n\nPatients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or worsening: eye \ninflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred \npromptly to an ophthalmology specialist.\n\nIf a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with gefitinib should be interrupted, and if \nsymptoms do not resolve, or if symptoms recur on reintroduction of gefitinib, permanent \ndiscontinuation should be considered.\n\nIn a phase I/II trial studying the use of gefitinib and radiation in paediatric patients, with newly \ndiagnosed brain stem glioma or incompletely resected supratentorial malignant glioma, 4 cases \n(1 fatal) of Central Nervous System (CNS) haemorrhages were reported from 45 patients enrolled. A \nfurther case of CNS haemorrhage has been reported in a child with an ependymoma from a trial with \ngefitinib alone. An increased risk of cerebral haemorrhage in adult patients with NSCLC receiving \ngefitinib has not been established.\n\nGastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients taking gefitinib. In most cases this is \nassociated with other known risk factors, including concomitant medications such as steroids or \nNSAIDS, underlying history of GI ulceration, age, smoking or bowel metastases at sites of perforation.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe metabolism of gefitinib is via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 (predominantly) and via \nCYP2D6.\n\nActive substances that may increase gefitinib plasma concentrations\nIn vitro studies have shown that gefitinib is a substrate of p-glycoprotein (Pgp). Available data do not \nsuggest any clinical consequences to this in vitro finding.\n\n\n\nSubstances that inhibit CYP3A4 may decrease the clearance of gefitinib. Concomitant administration \nwith potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, protease \ninhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin) may increase gefitinib plasma concentrations. The increase \nmay be clinically relevant since adverse reactions are related to dose and exposure. The increase might \nbe higher in individual patients with CYP2D6 poor metaboliser genotype. Pre-treatment with \nitraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) resulted in an 80% increase in the mean AUC of gefitinib in \nhealthy volunteers. In situations of concomitant treatment with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 the \npatient should be closely monitored for gefitinib adverse reactions.\n\nThere are no data on concomitant treatment with an inhibitor of CYP2D6 but potent inhibitors of this \nenzyme might cause increased plasma concentrations of gefitinib in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers \nby about 2-fold (see section 5.2). If concomitant treatment with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor is initiated, \nthe patient should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.\n\nActive substances that may reduce gefitinib plasma concentrations\nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may increase metabolism and decrease gefitinib \nplasma concentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of gefitinib. Concomitant medicinal products \nthat induce CYP3A4 (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates or St John’s wort/\nHypericum perforatum) should be avoided. Pre-treatment with rifampicin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer) \nin healthy volunteers reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 83% (see section 4.4).\n\nSubstances that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH may reduce gefitinib plasma \nconcentrations and thereby reduce the efficacy of gefitinib. High doses of short-acting antacids may \nhave a similar effect if taken regularly close in time to administration of gefitinib. Concomitant \nadministration of gefitinib with ranitidine at a dose that caused sustained elevations in gastric pH ≥ 5 \nresulted in a reduced mean gefitinib AUC by 47% in healthy volunteers (see section 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nActive substances that may have their plasma concentrations altered by gefitinib\nIn vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit CYP2D6. In a clinical trial in \npatients, gefitinib was co-administered with metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate). This resulted in a 35% \nincrease in exposure to metoprolol. Such an increase might potentially be relevant for CYP2D6 \nsubstrates with narrow therapeutic index. When the use of CYP2D6 substrates are considered in \ncombination with gefitinib, a dose modification of the CYP2D6 substrate should be considered \nespecially for products with a narrow therapeutic window.\n\nGefitinib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding is \nunknown.\n\nOther potential interactions\nINR elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients concomitantly taking \nwarfarin (see section 4.4).\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\n\nWomen of childbearing potential must be advised not to get pregnant during therapy.\n\nPregnancy\n\n\n\nThere are no data from the use of gefitinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. IRESSA should not \nbe used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether gefitinib is secreted in human milk. Gefitinib and metabolites of gefitinib \naccumulated in milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). Gefitinib is contraindicated during \nbreast-feeding and therefore breast-feeding must be discontinued while receiving gefitinib therapy (see \nsection 4.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nDuring treatment with gefitinib, asthenia has been reported. Therefore, patients who experience this \nsymptom should be cautious when driving or using machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn the pooled dataset from the ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical trials \n(2462 IRESSA-treated patients), the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs), \noccurring in more than 20% of the patients, are diarrhoea and skin reactions (including rash, acne, dry \nskin and pruritus). ADRs usually occur within the first month of therapy and are generally reversible. \nApproximately 8% of patients had a severe ADR (common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4). \nApproximately 3% of patients stopped therapy due to an ADR.\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) has occurred in 1.3% of patients, often severe (CTC grade 3-4). Cases \nwith fatal outcomes have been reported.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe safety profile presented in Table 1 is based on the gefitinib clinical development programme and \npostmarketed experience. Adverse reactions have been assigned to the frequency categories in Table 1 \nwhere possible based on the incidence of comparable adverse event reports in a pooled dataset from \nthe ISEL, INTEREST and IPASS phase III clinical trials (2462 IRESSA-treated patients).\n\nFrequencies of occurrence of undesirable effects are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare \n(< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions by system organ class and frequency\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders\n\nVery common Anorexia mild or moderate \n(CTC grade 1 or 2)\n\n\n\nEye disorders Common Conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and \ndry eye*, mainly mild (CTC \ngrade 1)\n\nUncommon Corneal erosion, reversible and \nsometimes in association with \naberrant eyelash growth\nKeratitis (0.12%)\n\nVascular disorders Common Haemorrhage, such as epistaxis \nand haematuria\n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders\n\nCommon Interstitial lung disease (1.3%), \noften severe (CTC grade 3-4). \nCases with fatal outcomes have \nbeen reported \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Diarrhoea, mainly mild or \nmoderate (CTC grade 1 or 2)\nVomiting, mainly mild or \nmoderate (CTC grade 1 or 2)\nNausea, mainly mild (CTC \ngrade 1)\nStomatitis, predominantly mild \nin nature (CTC grade 1)\n\nCommon Dehydration, secondary to \ndiarrhoea, nausea, vomiting or \nanorexia\nDry mouth*, predominantly \nmild (CTC grade 1)\n\nUncommon Pancreatitis\nGastrointestinal perforation\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very common Elevations in alanine \naminotransferase, mainly mild \nto moderate\n\nCommon Elevations in aspartate \naminotransferase, mainly mild \nto moderate\nElevations in total bilirubin, \nmainly mild to moderate\n\nUncommon Hepatitis**\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nVery common Skin reactions, mainly a mild or \nmoderate (CTC grade 1 or 2) \npustular rash, sometimes itchy \nwith dry skin, including skin \nfissures, on an erythematous \nbase\n\nCommon Nail disorder\nAlopecia\n\n\n\nAllergic reactions (1.1%), \nincluding\nangioedema and urticaria\n\nRare Bullous conditions including \ntoxic epidermal necrolysis, \nStevens Johnson syndrome and \nerythema multiforme\nCutaneous vasculitis\n\nRenal and urinary disorders Common Asymptomatic laboratory \nelevations in blood creatinine\nProteinuria\nCystitis\n\nRare Haemorrhagic cystitis\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery common Asthenia, predominantly mild \n(CTC grade 1)\n\nCommon Pyrexia\nThe frequency of adverse drug reactions relating to abnormal laboratory values is based on patients with a \n\nchange from baseline of 2 or more CTC grades in the relevant laboratory parameters.\n\n*This adverse reaction can occur in association with other dry conditions (mainly skin reactions) seen with \n\ngefitinib.\n\n**This includes isolated reports of hepatic failure which in some cases led to fatal outcomes.\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)\nIn the INTEREST trial, the incidence of ILD type events was 1.4% (10) patients in the gefitinib group\nversus 1.1% (8) patients in the docetaxel group. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a \npatient receiving gefitinib.\n\nIn the ISEL trial, the incidence of ILD-type events in the overall population was approximately 1% in \nboth treatment arms. The majority of ILD-type events reported was from patients of Asian ethnicity \nand the ILD incidence among patients of Asian ethnicity receiving gefitinib therapy and placebo was \napproximately 3% and 4% respectively. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a patient \nreceiving placebo.\n\nIn a post-marketing surveillance study in Japan (3350 patients) the reported rate of ILD-type events in \npatients receiving gefitinib was 5.8%. The proportion of ILD-type events with a fatal outcome was \n38.6%.\n\nIn a phase III open-label clinical trial (IPASS) in 1217 patients comparing IRESSA to \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment in selected patients with advanced \nNSCLC in Asia, the incidence of ILD-type events was 2.6% on the IRESSA treatment arm versus \n1.4% on the carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment arm.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose of gefitinib. However, in phase I clinical trials, \na limited number of patients were treated with daily doses of up to 1000 mg. An increase of frequency \nand severity of some adverse reactions was observed, mainly diarrhoea and skin rash. Adverse \nreactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically; in particular severe diarrhoea \nshould be managed as clinically indicated. In one study a limited number of patients were treated \nweekly with doses from 1500 mg to 3500 mg. In this study IRESSA exposure did not increase with \nincreasing dose, adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and were consistent with the \nknown safety profile of IRESSA.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01XE02\n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects\n\nThe epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR [HER1; ErbB1]) have been identified as \nkey drivers in the process of cell growth and proliferation for normal and cancer cells. EGFR \nactivating mutation within a cancer cell is an important factor in promotion of tumour cell growth, \nblocking of apoptosis, increasing the production of angiogenic factors and facilitating the processes of \nmetastasis.\n\nGefitinib is a selective small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase \nand is an effective treatment for patients with tumours with activating mutations of the EGFR tyrosine \nkinase domain regardless of line of therapy. No clinically relevant activity has been shown in patients \nwith known EGFR mutation-negative tumours.\n\nThe common EGFR activating mutations (Exon 19 deletions; L858R) have robust response data \nsupporting sensitivity to gefitinib; for example a progression free survival HR (95% CI) of 0.489 \n(0.336, 0.710) for gefitinib vs. doublet chemotherapy [WJTOG3405]. Gefitinib response data is more \nsparse in patients whose tumours contain the less common mutations; the available data indicates that \nG719X, L861Q and S7681 are sensitising mutations; and T790M alone or exon 20 insertions alone are \nresistance mechanisms.\n\nResistance\nMost NSCLC tumours with sensitising EGFR kinase mutations eventually develop resistance to \nIRESSA treatment, with a median time to disease progression of 1 year. In about 60% of cases, \nresistance is associated with a secondary T790M mutation for which T790M targeted EGFR TKIs may \nbe considered as a next line treatment option. Other potential mechanisms of resistance that have been \nreported following treatment with EGFR signal blocking agents include: bypass signalling such as\nHER2 and MET gene amplification and PIK3CA mutations. Phenotypic switch to small cell lung \ncancer has also been reported in 5-10% of cases.\n\nCirculating Tumour DNA (ctDNA)\n\n\n\nIn the IFUM trial, mutation status was assessed in tumour and ctDNA samples derived from plasma, \nusing the Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Both ctDNA and tumour samples were evaluable \nfor 652 patients out of 1060 screened. The objective response rate (ORR) in those patients who were \ntumour and ctDNA mutation positive was 77% (95% CI: 66% to 86%) and in those who were tumour \nonly mutation positive 60% (95% CI: 44% to 74%).\n\nTable 2 Summary of baseline mutation status for tumour and ctDNA samples in all screened \npatients evaluable for both samples\nMeasure Definition IFUM rate \n\n% (CI)\nIFUM \n\nN\nSensitivity Proportion of tumour M+ that are \n\nM+ by ctDNA\n65.7 (55.8, 74.7) 105\n\nSpecificity Proportion of tumour M- that are M-\nby ctDNA)\n\n99.8 (99.0, 100.0) 547\n\nThese data are consistent with the pre-planned exploratory Japanese subgroup analysis in IPASS (Goto \n2012). In that study ctDNA derived from serum, not plasma was used for EGFR mutation analysis \nusing the EGFR Mutation Test Kit (DxS) (N= 86). In that study, sensitivity was 43.1%, specificity was \n100%.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nFirst line treatment\nThe randomised phase III first line IPASS study was conducted in patients in Asia1 with advanced \n(stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology who were ex-light smokers (ceased smoking \n> 15 years ago and smoked < 10 pack years) or never smokers (see Table 3).\n\n1China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nTable 3 Efficacy outcomes for gefitinib versus carboplatin/paclitaxel from the IPASS study\n\nPopulation N Objective \nresponse rates \n\nand 95% CI for \ndifference \nbetween \n\ntreatmentsa\n\nPrimary endpoint\nProgression free survival \n\n(PFS) a,b\n\nOverall \nsurvivala,b\n\nOverall 1217 43.0% vs 32.2%\n[5.3%, 16.1%]\n\nHR 0.74\n[0.65, 0.85]\n\n5.7 m vs 5.8 m\np<0.0001\n\nHR 0.90\n[0.79, 1.02]\n\n18.8 m vs 17. 4m\np=0.1087\n\nEGFR \nmutation-positive\n\n261 71.2% vs 47.3%\n[12.0%, 34.9%]\n\nHR 0.48\n[0.36, 0.64]\n\n9.5 m vs 6.3 m\np<0.0001\n\nHR 1.00\n[0.76, 1.33]\n\n21.6 m vs 21.9 m\n\n\n\nPopulation N Objective \nresponse rates \n\nand 95% CI for \ndifference \nbetween \n\ntreatmentsa\n\nPrimary endpoint\nProgression free survival \n\n(PFS) a,b\n\nOverall \nsurvivala,b\n\nEGFR \nmutation-negative\n\n176 1.1% vs 23.5%\n[-32.5%, -13.3%]\n\nHR 2.85\n[2.05, 3.98]\n\n1.5 m vs 5.5 m\np<0.0001\n\nHR 1.18\n[0.86, 1.63]\n\n11.2 m vs 12.7 m\n\nEGFR mutation-\nunknown\n\n780 43.3% vs 29.2%\n[7.3%, 20.6%]\n\nHR 0.68\n[0.58 to 0.81]\n\n6.6 m vs 5.8 m\np<0.0001\n\nHR 0.82\n[0.70 to 0.96] \n\n18.9 m vs. 17.2 m\n\na Values presented are for IRESSA versus carboplatin/paclitaxel.\nb “m” is medians in months.

Asian patients also have a higher \nincidence of EGFR mutation-positive tumours.\n\nTable 7 Summary of multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors that \nindependently predicted for the presence of EGFR mutations in 786 Caucasian patients*\n\nFactors that \npredicted for \npresence of \n\nEGFR mutation\n\np-value Odds of EGFR \nmutation\n\nPositive predictive value (9.5% of the \noverall population are EGFR \n\nmutation-positive (M+))\n\nSmoking status <0.0001 6.5 times higher in never \nsmokers than \never-smokers\n\n28/70 (40%) of never smokers are M+ \n47/716 (7%) of ever smokers are M+\n\nHistology <0.0001 4.4 times higher in \nadenocarcinoma than in \n\nnon-adenocarcinoma\n\n63/396 (16%) of patients with \nadenocarcinoma histology are M+\n\n12/390 (3%) of patients with \nnon-adenocarcinoma histology are M+\n\nGender 0.0397 1.7 times higher in \nfemales than males\n\n40/235 (17%) of females are M+\n35/551 (6%) of males are M+\n\n*from the following studies: INTEREST, ISEL, INTACT 1&2, IDEAL 1&2, INVITE\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing oral administration of gefitinib, absorption is moderately slow and peak plasma \nconcentrations of gefitinib typically occur at 3 to 7 hours after administration. Mean absolute \nbioavailability is 59% in cancer patients. Exposure to gefitinib is not significantly altered by food. In a \ntrial in healthy volunteers where gastric pH was maintained above pH 5, gefitinib exposure was \nreduced by 47%, likely due to impaired solubility of gefitinib in the stomach (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nDistribution\n\nGefitinib has a mean steady-state volume of distribution of 1400 l indicating extensive distribution into \ntissue. Plasma protein binding is approximately 90%. Gefitinib binds to serum albumin and alpha \n1-acid glycoprotein.\n\nIn vitro data indicate that gefitinib is a substrate for the membrane transport protein P-gp.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nIn vitro data indicate that CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the major P450 isozyme involved in the oxidative \nmetabolism of gefitinib.\n\n\n\n17\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that gefitinib has limited potential to inhibit CYP2D6. Gefitinib shows no \nenzyme induction effects in animal studies and no significant inhibition (in vitro) of any other \ncytochrome P450 enzyme.\n\nGefitinib is extensively metabolised in humans. Five metabolites have been fully identified in excreta \nand 8 metabolites in plasma. The major metabolite identified was O-desmethyl gefitinib, which is \n14-fold less potent than gefitinib at inhibiting EGFR stimulated cell growth and has no inhibitory \neffect on tumour cell growth in mice. It is therefore considered unlikely that it contributes to the \nclinical activity of gefitinib.\n\nThe formation of O-desmethyl gefitinib has been shown, in vitro, to be via CYP2D6. The role of \nCYP2D6 in the metabolic clearance of gefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical trial in healthy \nvolunteers genotyped for CYP2D6 status. In poor metabolisers no measurable levels of O-desmethyl \ngefitinib were produced. The levels of exposure to gefitinib achieved in both the extensive and the \npoor metaboliser groups were wide and overlapping but the mean exposure to gefitinib was 2-fold \nhigher in the poor metaboliser group. The higher average exposures that could be achieved by \nindividuals with no active CYP2D6 may be clinically relevant since adverse effects are related to dose \nand exposure.\n\nElimination\n\nGefitinib is excreted mainly as metabolites via the faeces, with renal elimination of gefitinib and \nmetabolites accounting for less than 4% of the administered dose.\n\nGefitinib total plasma clearance is approximately 500 ml/min and the mean terminal half-life is \n41 hours in cancer patients. Administration of gefitinib once daily results in 2- to 8-fold accumulation, \nwith steady state exposures achieved after 7 to 10 doses. At steady state, circulating plasma \nconcentrations are typically maintained within a 2- to 3-fold range over the 24-hour dosing interval.\n\nSpecial populations\nFrom analyses of population pharmacokinetic data in cancer patients, no relationships were identified \nbetween predicted steady-state trough concentration and patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity or \ncreatinine clearance (above 20 ml/min).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn a phase I open-label study of single dose gefitinib 250 mg in patients with mild, moderate or severe \nhepatic impairment due to cirrhosis (according to Child-Pugh classification), there was an increase in \nexposure in all groups compared with healthy controls. An average 3.1-fold increase in exposure to \ngefitinib in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment was observed. None of the patients \nhad cancer, all had cirrhosis and some had hepatitis. This increase in exposure may be of clinical \nrelevance since adverse experiences are related to dose and exposure to gefitinib.\n\nGefitinib has been evaluated in a clinical trial conducted in 41 patients with solid tumours and normal \nhepatic function, or moderate or severe hepatic impairment (classified according to baseline Common \nToxicity Criteria grades for AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) due to liver metastases. It was \nshown that following daily administration of 250 mg gefitinib, time to steady-state, total plasma \nclearance (CmaxSS) and steady-state exposure (AUC24SS) were similar for the groups with normal and \n\n\n\n18\n\nmoderately impaired hepatic function. Data from 4 patients with severe hepatic impairment due to liver \nmetastases suggested that steady-state exposures in these patients are also similar to those in patients \nwith normal hepatic function.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to the \nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows:\n\n Corneal epithelia atrophy and corneal translucencies\n Renal papillary necrosis\n Hepatocellular necrosis and eosinophilic sinusoidal macrophage infiltration\n\nData from non-clinical (in vitro) studies indicate that gefitinib has the potential to inhibit the cardiac \naction potential repolarisation process (e.g. QT interval). Clinical experience has not shown a causal \nassociation between QT prolongation and gefitinib.\n\nA reduction in female fertility was observed in the rat at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day.\n\nPublished studies have shown that genetically modified mice, lacking expression of EGFR, exhibit \ndevelopmental defects, related to epithelial immaturity in a variety of organs including the skin, \ngastrointestinal tract and lung. When gefitinib was administered to rats during organogenesis, there \nwere no effects on embryofoetal development at the highest dose (30 mg/kg/day). However, in the \nrabbit, there were reduced foetal weights at 20 mg/kg/day and above. There were no \ncompound-induced malformations in either species. When administered to the rat throughout gestation \nand parturition, there was a reduction in pup survival at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day.\n\nFollowing oral administration of C-14 labelled gefitinib to lactating rats 14 days post-partum, \nconcentrations of radioactivity in milk were 11-19 fold higher than in blood.\n\nGefitinib showed no genotoxic potential.\n\nA 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats resulted in a small but statistically significant increased \nincidence of hepatocellular adenomas in both male and female rats and mesenteric lymph node \nhaemangiosarcomas in female rats at the highest dose (10 mg/kg/day) only. The hepatocellular \nadenomas were also seen in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, which demonstrated a small \nincreased incidence of this finding in male mice at the mid dose, and in both male and female mice at \nthe highest dose. The effects reached statistical significance for the female mice, but not for the males.\nAt no-effect levels in both mice and rats there was no margin in clinical exposure. The clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown.\n\nThe results of an in vitro phototoxicity study demonstrated that gefitinib may have phototoxicity \npotential.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet:\n\n1. What IRESSA is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you take IRESSA\n3. How to take IRESSA\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store IRESSA\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What IRESSA is and what it is used for\n\nIRESSA contains the active substance gefitinib which blocks a protein called ‘epidermal growth factor \nreceptor’ (EGFR). This protein is involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\nIRESSA is used to treat adults with non-small cell lung cancer. This cancer is a disease in which \nmalignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take IRESSA\n\nDo not take IRESSA\n if you are allergic to gefitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6, ‘What IRESSA contains’).\n if you are breast-feeding.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking IRESSA\n if you have ever had any other lung problems. Some lung problems may get worse during \n\ntreatment with IRESSA.\n if you have ever had problems with your liver.\n\n\n\n32\n\nChildren and adolescents\nIRESSA is not indicated in children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and IRESSA\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nIn particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n Phenytoin or carbamazepine (for epilepsy).\n Rifampicin (for tuberculosis).\n Itraconazole (for fungal infections).\n Barbiturates (a type of medicine used for sleeping problems).\n Herbal remedies containing St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, used for depression and \n\nanxiety).\n Proton-pump inhibitors, H2-antagonists and antacids (for ulcers, indigestion, heartburn and to \n\nreduce acids in the stomach).\nThese medicines may affect the way IRESSA works.\n Warfarin (a so-called oral anticoagulant, to prevent blood clots). If you are taking a medicine \n\ncontaining this active substance, your doctor may need to do blood tests more often.\nIf any of the above applies to you, or if you are not sure, check with your doctor or pharmacist before \ntaking IRESSA.\n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility\nTalk to your doctor before taking this medicine if you are pregnant, may become pregnant or are \nbreast-feeding.\nIt is recommended that you avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with IRESSA because IRESSA\ncould harm your baby.\nDo not take IRESSA if you are breast-feeding for the safety of your baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nIf you feel weak whilst taking this medicine, take care driving or using tools or machines.\n\nIRESSA contains lactose\nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine.\n\nIRESSA contains sodium\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) of sodium per dose, that is to say it is essentially \n‘sodium-free’.\n\n3. How to take IRESSA\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure.\n\n The recommended dose is one 250 mg tablet per day.\n Take the tablet at about the same time each day.\n\n\n\n33\n\n You can take the tablet with or without food.\n Do not take antacids (to reduce the acid level of your stomach) 2 hours before or 1 hour after \n\ntaking IRESSA.\n\nIf you have trouble swallowing the tablet, dissolve it in half a glass of still (non-fizzy) water. Do not \nuse any other liquids. Do not crush the tablet. Swirl the water until the tablet has dissolved. This may \ntake up to 20 minutes. Drink the liquid straight away. To make sure that you have drunk all of the \nmedicine, rinse the glass very well with half a glass of water and drink it.\n\nIf you take more IRESSA than you should\nIf you have taken more tablets than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away.\n\nIf you forget to take IRESSA\nWhat to do if you forget to take a tablet depends on how long it is until your next dose.\n If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose: take the missed tablet as soon as you remember. \n\nThen take the next dose as usual.\n If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose: skip the missed tablet. Then take the next tablet \n\nat the usual time.\nDo not take a double dose (two tablets at the same time) to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nTell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects - you may need urgent \nmedical treatment:\n\n Allergic reaction (common), particularly if symptoms include swollen face, lips, tongue or \nthroat, difficulty to swallow, hives, nettle rash and difficulty breathing.\n\n Serious breathlessness, or sudden worsening breathlessness, possibly with a cough or fever. \nThis may mean that you have an inflammation of the lungs called ‘interstitial lung disease’. This \nmay affect about 1 in 100 patients taking IRESSA and can be life-threatening.\n\n Severe skin reactions (rare) affecting large areas of your body. The signs may include redness, \npain, ulcers, blisters, and shedding of the skin. The lips, nose, eyes and genitals may also be \naffected.\n\n Dehydration (common) caused by long term or severe diarrhoea, vomiting (being sick), nausea \n(feeling sick) or loss of appetite.\n\n Eye problems (uncommon), such as pain, redness, watery eyes, light sensitivity, changes in \nvision or ingrowing eyelashes. This may mean that you have an ulcer on the surface of the eye \n(cornea).\n\n\n\n34\n\nTell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following side effects:\n\nVery common: side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n Diarrhoea\n Vomiting\n Nausea\n Skin reactions such as an acne-like rash, which is sometimes itchy with dry and/or cracked\n\nskin\n Loss of appetite\n Weakness\n Red or sore mouth\n Increase of a liver enzyme known as alanine aminotransferase in a blood test; if too high, your \n\ndoctor may tell you to stop taking IRESSA\n\nCommon: side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n Dry mouth\n Dry, red or itchy eyes\n Red and sore eyelids\n Nail problems\n Hair loss\n Fever\n Bleeding (such as nose bleed or blood in your urine)\n Protein in your urine (shown in a urine test)\n Increase of bilirubin and the other liver enzyme known as aspartate aminotransferase in a \n\nblood test; if too high, your doctor may tell you to stop taking IRESSA\n Increase of creatinine levels in a blood test (related to kidney function)\n Cystitis (burning sensations during urination and frequent, urgent need to urinate)\n\nUncommon: side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n Inflammation of the pancreas. The signs include very severe pain in the upper part of the \n\nstomach area and severe nausea and vomiting.\n Inflammation of the liver. Symptoms may include a general feeling of being unwell, with or \n\nwithout possible jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). This side effect is uncommon; \nhowever, some patients have died from this.\n\n Gastrointestinal perforation\n\nRare: side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people)\n Inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin. This may give the appearance of bruising or \n\npatches of non-blanching rash on the skin.\n Haemorrhagic cystitis (burning sensations during urination and frequent, urgent need to \n\nurinate with blood in the urine).\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V.
