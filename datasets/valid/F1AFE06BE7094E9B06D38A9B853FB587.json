NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTritanrix HepB, suspension for injection \nDiphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (whole cell) (Pw) and hepatitis B (rDNA) (HBV) vaccine (adsorbed) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nDiphtheria toxoid1 not less than 30 IU \nTetanus toxoid1 not less than 60 IU \nBordetella pertussis (inactivated)2 not less than 4 IU \nHepatitis B surface antigen 2,3 10 micrograms \n \n1 Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.26 milligrams Al3+ \n2 Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.37 milligrams Al3+ \n3 Produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTritanrix HepB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis B \n(HBV) in infants from 6 weeks onwards (see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml. \n \nPrimary vaccination: \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses within the first six months of life.  Where HBV \nvaccine is not given at birth, the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of age.  \nWhere there is a high endemicity of HBV, the practice to administer HBV vaccine at birth should be \ncontinued. In these circumstances, vaccination with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of age. \n \nThree vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks. \n \nWhen Tritanrix HepB is given according to the 6-10-14 weeks schedule, it is recommended to \nadminister a dose of HBV vaccine at birth to improve protection. \n \nIn the case of children born of known HBV carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B \nshould not be modified. This may require separate vaccination with HBV and DTPw vaccines and also \ninclude the administration of HBIg at birth.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\n \nBooster vaccination: \n \nA booster dose with Tritanrix HepB will give rise to increased reactogenicity as would be expected for a \nbooster during the second year of life. In consequence, boostering should follow local recommendations.   \n \nThe administration of a booster dose with trivalent DTP vaccine is recommended before the end of the \nsecond year of life. For long-term protection against HBV, a booster dose of HBV vaccine could also be \nadministered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTritanrix HepB is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \nIt is recommended that in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders the vaccine be administered \nsubcutaneously (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \nThe administration of Tritanrix HepB should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile \nillness. \n \nTritanrix HepB is contraindicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, \noccurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these \ncircumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and HBV vaccines. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous \nvaccination and possible occurrence of adverse reactions) and a clinical examination. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of \nanaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should \nremain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after vaccination. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Tritanrix HepB, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. \n\nTemperature of \u2265 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \nPersistent crying lasting \u2265 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \nConvulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \n\nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh \npossible risks.  \n \nAs for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Tritanrix HepB or deferring this vaccination \nshould be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe \nneurological disorder. \nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, a family history of SIDS (Sudden Infant \nDeath Syndrome) and a family history of an adverse reaction following Tritanrix HepB vaccination do not \nconstitute contra-indications. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\nHIV infection is not considered as a contra-indication for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and HBV vaccination. \nThe expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients, \ne.g. patients on immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nTritanrix HepB should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nTRITANRIX HepB SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED \nINTRAVENOUSLY. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when \nadministering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \u2264 28 weeks of gestation) and \nparticularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIt is current practice in paediatric vaccination to co-administer different vaccines during the same session \nwith injectable vaccines being administered at separate injection sites. \n \nTritanrix HepB can be administered simultaneously at separate sites or in any temporal relationship with \nother paediatric vaccines if this fits conveniently in the immunisation scheme. \n \nIn clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB has been administered simultaneously with oral polio vaccine (OPV) and \nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. In these studies the immune response to the oral polio vaccine \nhas not been investigated, however, previous experience with simultaneous administration of DTP, OPV and \nHBV vaccines has not shown any interference. In some clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB was used to \nreconstitute the lyophilised Hib vaccine (Hiberix); no interference in the immune response to any of the \nantigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following administration of the vaccines at \nseparate sites (see section 6.2). \n \nIn patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response \nmay not be achieved. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nAs Tritanrix HepB is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used \nduring pregnancy or lactation is not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\u2022 Clinical trials: \n \n\nIn clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were reactions at the injection site, \nincluding redness, swelling and pain. \n \nGeneral reactions that may occur in temporal association with Tritanrix HepB vaccination are listed \nbelow. \n \nFrequencies are defined as follows: \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \nNervous system disorders: \nvery common: drowsiness \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: \ncommon: bronchitis  \nuncommon: respiratory disorder \n \nGastro-intestinal disorders: \nvery common: feeding problems \ncommon: gastro-intestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea \n \nInfections and infestations: \ncommon: otitis media, pharyngitis \nuncommon: pneumonia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nvery common: fever, swelling, pain and redness \n \nImmune system disorders: \nvery rare: allergic reactions including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness \nlike disease \n \nPsychiatric disorders: \nvery common: unusual crying, irritability \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nIn a prospective comparative study, which compared the administration of the combined DTPw-HBV \nvaccine with the simultaneous separate administration of DTPw and HBV vaccine, higher incidences of pain, \nredness, swelling and fever were reported in the group receiving the combined vaccine.

The Pw component is obtained by \nheat inactivation of phase I culture of Bordetella pertussis bacteria. \n \nThe surface antigen of the HBV (HBsAg) is produced by culture of genetically-engineered yeast cells \n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which carry the gene coding for the major surface antigen of the HBV.  This \nHBsAg expressed in yeast cells is purified by several physico-chemical steps.  The HBsAg assembles \nspontaneously, in the absence of chemical treatment, into spherical particles of 20 nm in average diameter \ncontaining non-glycosylated HBsAg polypeptide and a lipid matrix consisting mainly of phospholipids.  \nExtensive tests have demonstrated that these particles display the characteristic properties of the natural \nHBsAg. \n \nFour different schedules have been studied (6-10-14 weeks, 2-4-6 months; 3-4-5 months and 3-4\u00bd-6 months) \naccording to routine vaccination practices in different countries with three doses administered within the first \nsix months of life. \n \nFor each component of the vaccine, the following immune responses have been documented one month after \ncompletion of the primary vaccination schedule. \n \nPercentage of subjects with antibody titres \u2265 assay cut-off one month after primary vaccination with \nTritanrix HepB: \n \n\n6-10-14 weeks 2-4-6 months; 3-4-5 months \nand 3-4\u00bd-6 months \n\nAntibody \n(cut-off) \n\n% % \n\nAnti-diphtheria  \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n93.1 99.7 \n\nAnti-tetanus  \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n100 100 \n\nAnti-B.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTritanrix HepB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and hepatitis \nB (HBV) in infants from 6 weeks onwards (see section 4.2). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml. \n \nPrimary vaccination: \n \nThe primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses within the first six months of life.  Where HBV \nvaccine is not given at birth, the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of \nage.  Where there is a high endemicity of HBV, the practice to administer HBV vaccine at birth should \nbe continued.  In these circumstances, vaccination with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of \nage. \n \nThree vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks. \n \nWhen Tritanrix HepB is given according to the 6-10-14 weeks schedule, it is recommended to \nadminister a dose of HBV vaccine at birth to improve protection. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\nIn the case of children born of known HBV carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for \nhepatitis B should not be modified.  This may require separate vaccination with HBV and DTPw \nvaccines and also include the administration of HBIg at birth.  \n \nBooster vaccination: \n \nA booster dose with Tritanrix HepB will give rise to increased reactogenicity as would be expected for a \nbooster during the second year of life. In consequence, boostering should follow local recommendations.  \n \nThe administration of a booster dose with trivalent DTP vaccine is recommended before the end of the \nsecond year of life. For long-term protection against HBV, a booster dose of HBV vaccine could also be \nadministered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTritanrix HepB is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the anterolateral thigh. \n \nIt is recommended that in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders the vaccine be administered \nsubcutaneously (see section 4.4.). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \nThe administration of Tritanrix HepB should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe \nfebrile illness. \n \nTritanrix HepB is contraindicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, \noccurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.  In these \ncircumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and HBV vaccines. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nVaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous \nvaccination and possible occurrence of adverse reactions) and a clinical examination. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case \nof anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.  For this reason, the vaccinee \nshould remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after vaccination. \n \nIf any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of Tritanrix HepB, the decision to give \nsubsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered. \n\nTemperature of \u2265 40.0 C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. \nCollapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. \nPersistent crying lasting \u2265 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. \nConvulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. \n\nThere may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh \npossible risks.  \n \nAs for any vaccination, the risk-benefit of immunising with Tritanrix HepB or deferring this vaccination \nshould be weighed carefully in an infant or in a child suffering from a new onset or progression of a severe \nneurological disorder. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\nA history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, a family history of SIDS (Sudden Infant \nDeath Syndrome) and a family history of an adverse reaction following Tritanrix HepB vaccination do \nnot constitute contra-indications. \n \nHIV infection is not considered as a contra-indication for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and HBV vaccination. \nThe expected immunological response may not be obtained after vaccination of immunosuppressed patients, \ne.g. patients on immunosuppressive therapy. \n \nTritanrix HepB should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding \ndisorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. \n \nTRITANRIX HepB SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED \nINTRAVENOUSLY. \n \nThe potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered when \nadministering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born \u2264 28 weeks of gestation) and \nparticularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. \n \nAs the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or \ndelayed. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIt is current practice in paediatric vaccination to co-administer different vaccines during the same \nsession with injectable vaccines being administered at separate injection sites. \n \nTritanrix HepB can be administered simultaneously at separate sites or in any temporal relationship with \nother paediatric vaccines if this fits conveniently in the immunisation scheme. \n \nIn clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB has been administered simultaneously with oral polio vaccine (OPV) \nand Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. In these studies the immune response to the oral polio \nvaccine has not been investigated, however, previous experience with simultaneous administration of \nDTP, OPV and HBV vaccines has not shown any interference.  In some clinical studies, Tritanrix HepB \nwas used to reconstitute the lyophilised Hib vaccine (Hiberix); no interference in the immune response \nto any of the antigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following administration of \nthe vaccines at separate sites.

The Pw component is \nobtained by heat inactivation of phase I culture of Bordetella pertussis bacteria. \n \nThe surface antigen of the HBV (HBsAg) is produced by culture of genetically-engineered yeast cells \n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which carry the gene coding for the major surface antigen of the HBV.  \nThis HBsAg expressed in yeast cells is purified by several physico-chemical steps.  The HBsAg \nassembles spontaneously, in the absence of chemical treatment, into spherical particles of 20 nm in \naverage diameter containing non-glycosylated HBsAg polypeptide and a lipid matrix consisting \nmainly of phospholipids.  Extensive tests have demonstrated that these particles display the \ncharacteristic properties of the natural HBsAg. \n \nFour different schedules have been studied (6-10-14 weeks, 2-4-6 months; 3-4-5 months and 3-4\u00bd-6 months) \naccording to routine vaccination practices in different countries with three doses administered within the first \nsix months of life. \n \nFor each component of the vaccine, the following immune responses have been documented one \nmonth after completion of the primary vaccination schedule. \n \nPercentage of subjects with antibody titres \u2265 assay cut-off one month after primary vaccination with \nTritanrix HepB: \n \n\n6-10-14 weeks 2-4-6 months; 3-4-5 months \nand 3-4\u00bd-6 months \n\nAntibody \n(cut-off) \n\n% % \n\nAnti-diphtheria  \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n93.1 99.7 \n\nAnti-tetanus  \n(0.1 IU/ml) \u2020 \n\n100 100 \n\nAnti-B.

Further information \n \n \n1.   WHAT TRITANRIX HepB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nTritanrix HepB is a vaccine used in children to prevent four diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis \n(whooping cough) and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection \n(antibodies) against these diseases. \n \n\u2022 Diphtheria: Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways \n\nbecome inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria \nalso release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. \n\n \n\u2022 Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin.  \n\nWounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated \nwith soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can \ncause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong \nenough to cause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n\u2022 Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways \n\ncausing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often \naccompanied by a \u201cwhooping\u201d sound, hence the common name \u201cwhooping cough\u201d.  The cough may last \nfor 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, \npneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death.   \n\n \n\u2022 Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become inflamed and \n\nswollen .

Further information \n \n \n1.   WHAT TRITANRIX HepB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nTritanrix HepB is a vaccine used in children to prevent four diseases: diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis \n(whooping cough) and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection \n(antibodies) against these diseases. \n \n\u2022 Diphtheria: Diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin.  Generally the airways \n\nbecome inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation.  The bacteria \nalso release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. \n\n \n\u2022 Tetanus (Lockjaw): Tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin.  \n\nWounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated \nwith soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters.  The bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can \ncause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death.  The muscle spasms can be strong \nenough to cause bone fractures of the spine. \n\n \n\u2022 Pertussis (Whooping cough): Pertussis is a highly infectious illness.  The disease affects the airways \n\ncausing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing.  The coughing is often \naccompanied by a \u201cwhooping\u201d sound, hence the common name \u201cwhooping cough\u201d.  The cough may last \nfor 1-2 months or longer.  Pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, \npneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death.   \n\n \n\u2022 Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become inflamed and \n\nswollen.  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of \ninfected people. \n\n \nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine are \ninfectious.  \n \n \n2.

tetanus (lockjaw), pertussis (whooping cough) and hepatitis b. the vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases. diphtheria: diphtheria mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. generally the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation. the bacteria also release a toxin (poison), which can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. tetanus (lockjaw): tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. wounds that are especially prone to infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure/dung or wood splinters. the bacteria release a toxin (poison), which can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. the muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. pertussis (whooping cough): pertussis is a highly infectious illness. the disease affects the airways causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with normal breathing. the coughing is often accompanied by a \"whooping\" sound, hence the common name \"whooping cough\". the cough may last for 1-2 months or longer. pertussis can also cause ear infections, bronchitis which may last a long time, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and even death. hepatitis b: hepatitis b is caused by the hepatitis b virus. it causes the liver to become inflamed and swollen . the virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people. vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. none of the components in the vaccine are infectious.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "tritanrix hepb", "Type":
