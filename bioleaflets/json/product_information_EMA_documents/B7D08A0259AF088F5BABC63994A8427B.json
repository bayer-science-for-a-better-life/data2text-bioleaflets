NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nActelsar HCT 40 mg/12.5 mg tablets \nActelsar HCT 80 mg/12.5 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nActelsar HCT 40 mg/12.5 mg tablets \nEach tablet contains 40 mg telmisartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nActelsar HCT 80 mg/12.5 mg tablets \nEach tablet contains 80 mg telmisartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \n \nActelsar HCT 40 mg/12.5 mg tablets \nWhite or almost white, 6.55 x 13.6 mm oval-shaped and biconvex tablets marked with “TH” on one \nside. \n \nActelsar HCT 80 mg/12.5 mg tablets \nWhite or almost white, 9.0 x 17.0 mm capsule-shaped tablets marked with “TH 12.5” on both sides. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n \nActelsar HCT fixed dose combination (40 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide and \n80 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not \nadequately controlled on telmisartan alone. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nActelsar HCT should be taken in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by \ntelmisartan alone. Individual dose titration with each of the two components is recommended before \nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \nto the fixed combination may be considered. \n \n- Actelsar HCT 40 mg/12.5 mg may be administered once daily in patients whose blood pressure \n\nis not adequately controlled by telmisartan 40 mg \n- Actelsar HCT 80 mg/12.5 mg may be administered once daily in patients whose blood pressure \n\nis not adequately controlled by telmisartan 80 mg \n \nActelsar HCT is also available at the dose strength 80 mg/25 mg \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations: \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nPeriodic monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed Actelsar HCT \n40 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Actelsar HCT is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Actelsar HCT in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nActelsar HCT tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or \nwithout food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a \n\nsulphonamide-derived medicinal product). \n- Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n- Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. \n- Severe hepatic impairment. \n- Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). \n- Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia. \n \nThe concomitant use of Actelsar HCT with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and \n4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nActelsar HCT should not be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe \nhepatic insufficiency (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These \npatients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIn addition, Actelsar HCT should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or \nprogressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Actelsar HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nRenovascular hypertension \n \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n \nActelsar HCT must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). There is no experience regarding the administration of \ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with recent kidney transplantation. Experience with \ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide is modest in the patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, \ntherefore periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThiazide diuretic associated azotaemia may occur in patients with impaired renal function. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia \n \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of Actelsar HCT. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \n \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal \ndisease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has \nbeen associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \n \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n \nThiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance, whereas hypoglycaemia may occur in diabetic patients \nunder insulin or antidiabetic therapy and telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients blood \nglucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be \nrequired, when indicated. Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. \n \nAn increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels has been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever, at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Actelsar HCT, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in some patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance \n \nAs for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be \nperformed at appropriate intervals. \n \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (including \nhypokalaemia, hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte \nimbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or \ncramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as \nnausea or vomiting (see section 4.8). \n \n- Hypokalaemia \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \ntelmisartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \nwith cirrhosis of liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate \noral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see section 4.5). \n \n- Hyperkalaemia \nConversely, due to the antagonism of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptors by the telmisartan component \nof Actelsar HCT, hyperkalaemia might occur. Although clinically significant hyperkalaemia has not \nbeen documented with Actelsar HCT, risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal \ninsufficiency and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium \nsupplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with \nActelsar HCT (see section 4.5). \n \n- Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis \nThere is no evidence that Actelsar HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n \n- Hypercalcaemia \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \n \n- Hypomagnesaemia \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnesaemia (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEthnic differences \n \nAs with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan is apparently less effective in \nlowering blood pressure in black patients than in non blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of \nlow renin states in the black hypertensive population. \n \nOther \n \nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n \nGeneral \n \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. Exacerbation or \nactivation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide diuretics, \nincluding hydrochlorothiazide. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If a \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a \nre-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to \nthe sun or to artificial UVA. \n \nChoroidal effusion, acute Myopia and Angle-Closure Glaucoma \n \nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal \neffusion with visual field defect, acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms \ninclude acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks \nof telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to \npermanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as \npossible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure \nremains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history \nof sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \nExcipient(s) \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nLithium \n \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Rare cases have \nalso been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including \ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide). Co-administration of lithium and Actelsar HCT is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \nrecommended during concomitant use. \n \nMedicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \nlaxatives, corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin, carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium, salicylic acid and \nderivatives) \n \nIf these substances are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, \nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. These medicinal products may potentiate the effect \nof hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products that may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, cyclosporin \nor other medicinal products such as heparin sodium). \n \nIf these medicinal products are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, \nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. Based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of the above medicinal \nproducts may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section \n4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances \n \nPeriodic monitoring of serum potassium and ECG is recommended when Actelsar HCT is \nadministered with medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis \nglycosides, antiarrhythmics) and the following torsades de pointes inducing medicinal products (which \ninclude some antiarrhythmics), hypokalaemia being a predisposing factor to torsades de pointes. \n- class Ia antiarrythmics (e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide) \n- class III antiarrythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) \n- some antipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, trifluoperazine, \n\ncyamemazine, sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol) \n- others (e.g. bepridil, cisapride, diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, \n\npentamidine, sparfloxacine, terfenadine, vincamine IV) \n \nDigitalis glycosides \n \nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favours the onset of digitalis-induced \narrhythmia (see section 4.4). \n \nDigoxin \n \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nOther antihypertensive agents \n \nTelmisartan may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. \n \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulin) \n \nDose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal products may be required (see section 4.4). \n \nMetformin \n \nMetformin should be used with precaution: risk of lactic acidosis induced by a possible functional \nrenal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nCholestyramine and colestipol resins \n \nAbsorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) \n \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dose regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and \nnon-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide \ndiuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents \nthat inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible \nacute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the combination should be administered with \ncaution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be \ngiven to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically \nthereafter. \n \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline) \n \nThe effect of pressor amines may be decreased. \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine) \n \nThe effect of nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nMedicinal products used in the treatment for gout (e.g. probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and allopurinol) \n \nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase in dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \nCo-administration of thiazide may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions of allopurinol. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nCalcium salts \n \nThiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to the decreased excretion. If calcium \nsupplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be prescribed, serum \ncalcium levels should be monitored and calcium dose adjusted accordingly. \n \nBeta-blockers and diazoxide \n \nThe hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. \n \nAnticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-type \ndiuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. \n \nAmantadine \n \nThiazides may increase the risk of adverse events caused by amantadine. \n \nCytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) \n \nThiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, \namifostine. \nFurthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Actelsar HCT in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). Should \nexposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, \nultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be \nused for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased \nplasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a beneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan during breast-feeding, Actelsar \nHCT is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during \nbreast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.  \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of hydrochlorothiazide during breast feeding \nis not recommended. If hydrochlorothiazide is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low \nas possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide on male and female fertility \nwere observed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nActelsar HCT can have influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness or drowsiness \nmay occasionally occur when taking Actelsar HCT. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction is dizziness. Serious angioedema may occur rarely \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). \n \nThe overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide was \ncomparable to those reported with telmisartan alone in randomised controlled trials involving \n1,471 patients randomised to receive telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide (835) or telmisartan alone \n(636). Dose-relationship of adverse reactions was not established and they showed no correlation with \ngender, age or race of the patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported in all clinical trials and occurring more frequently (p≤0.05) with \ntelmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide than with placebo are shown below according to system organ \nclass.

Japanese patients are more likely to experience these \nadverse reactions. \n \nSepsis \nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal \nassociation with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited information available for telmisartan with regard to overdose in humans. The degree \nto which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n \nSymptoms \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia, dizziness, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been \n\n\n\n15 \n\nreported. Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and/or \naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain \nanti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nTreatment \nTelmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the \ntreatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion \nand the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric \nlavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and \ncreatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a \nsupine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II antagonists \nand diuretics, ATC code: C09DA07 \n \nActelsar HCT is a combination of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a thiazide \ndiuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive \neffect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. Actelsar HCT once \ndaily produces effective and smooth reductions in blood pressure across the therapeutic dose range. \n \nMechanism of action \nTelmisartan is an orally effective and specific angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist. \nTelmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor \nsubtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any \npartial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The \nbinding is long-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and \nother less characterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the \neffect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. \nPlasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma \nrenin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), \nthe enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore, it is not expected to potentiate \nbradykinin-mediated adverse events. \nAn 80 mg dose of telmisartan administered to healthy volunteers almost completely inhibits the \nangiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and \nstill measurable up to 48 hours. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides have an effect on the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte \nreabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent \namounts. The diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin \nactivity, increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and \nbicarbonate loss, and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, co-administration of telmisartan tends to reverse the potassium loss \nassociated with these diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak \neffect occurs at about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \n\n\n\n16 \n\nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4-8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy. The antihypertensive effect persists constantly \nover 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory \nblood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by measurements made at the point of maximum \neffect and immediately prior to the next dose (through to peak ratios consistently above 80% after \ndoses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies). \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents \nrepresentative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials \ncomparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) \ncompared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \ncardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery \ndisease, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence \nof end-organ damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), \nwhich is a population at risk for cardiovascular events. \n \nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg \n(n = 8542), ramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg \n(n = 8502), and followed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years. \n \nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for \ncongestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) \nand ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - \n1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and \n11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients, respectively. \n \nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 - \n1.08), p (non-inferiority = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart \nOutcomes Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo. \n \nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. \nThe mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the \nincidence of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, \nnon-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan \nand 17.0 % in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p=0.22)]. There \nwas evidence for a benefit of telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary \ncomposite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke \n[0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality \n(hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24). \n \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \n\n\n\n17 \n\nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. \nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. For more detailed \ninformation see above under the heading “Cardiovascular prevention”. \nVA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in \npatients treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan. \n \nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was \na significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the \ncombination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended \nin this population. \n \nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients \n50 years and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for \ntelmisartan compared with placebo, 0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval \n1.00-2.06)]; the incidence of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) \nvs. patients taking placebo (0.16 %) [RR 2.07 (95 % confidence interval 1.14-3.76)]. The observed \nincreased occurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance \nfinding or related to a mechanism not currently known. \n \nEpidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with hydrochlorothiazide reduces the \nrisk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThe effects of fixed dose combination of telmisartan/HCT on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity \nare currently unknown. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntelmisartan hydrochlorothiazide in all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan does not appear to affect the \npharmacokinetics of either substance in healthy subjects. \n \nAbsorption \nTelmisartan: Following oral administration, peak concentrations of telmisartan are reached in 0.5-1.5 h \nafter dosing. The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan at 40 mg and 160 mg was 42% and 58%, \nrespectively. Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan with a reduction in the area under \nthe plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 19% after a \n160 mg dose. By 3 hours after administration plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is \ntaken fasting or with food. The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the \ntherapeutic efficacy. Telmisartan does not accumulate significantly in plasma on repeated \nadministration. \nHydrochlorothiazide: Following oral administration of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide, peak \nconcentrations of hydrochlorothiazide are reached in approximately 1.0-3.0 hours after dosing. Based \non cumulative renal excretion of hydrochlorothiazide the absolute bioavailability was about 60%. \n \nDistribution \nTelmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99.5%) mainly albumin and alpha l-acid \nglycoprotein. The apparent volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 litres \nindicating additional tissue binding. \nHydrochlorothiazide is 68% protein bound in the plasma and its apparent volume of distribution is \n0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide. The \nglucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in humans. After a \nsingle dose of 14C-labelled telmisartan the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured \nradioactivity in plasma. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of \ntelmisartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolised in man. \n \nElimination \nTelmisartan: Following either intravenous or oral administration of 14C-labelled telmisartan most of \nthe administered dose (>97%) was eliminated in faeces via biliary excretion. Only minute amounts \nwere found in urine. Total plasma clearance of telmisartan after oral administration is >1500 ml/min. \nTerminal elimination half-life was >20 hours. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted almost entirely as unchanged substance in urine. About 60% of the \noral dose is eliminated within 48 hours. Renal clearance is about 250-300 ml/min. The terminal \nelimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide is 10-15 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity  \nTelmisartan: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are non-linear over doses from \n20 – 160 mg with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) with \nincreasing doses. \nHydrochlorothiazide exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.  \n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nGender \nPlasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2-3 times higher in females than in males. In \nclinical trials however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of \northostatic hypotension were found in women. No dose adjustment is necessary. There was a trend \ntowards higher plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in female than in male subjects. This is \nnot considered to be of clinical relevance. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal excretion does not contribute to the clearance of telmisartan. Based on modest experience in \npatients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/min, mean about \n50 ml/min) no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function. Telmisartan is \nnot removed from blood by haemodialysis. In patients with impaired renal function the rate of \nhydrochlorothiazide elimination is reduced. In a typical study in patients with a mean creatinine \nclearance of 90 ml/min the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was increased. In functionally \nanephric patients the elimination half-life is about 34 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability up to nearly 100%. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical safety studies performed with co-administration of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide \nin normotensive rats and dogs, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused no additional findings not already observed with administration of either substance \nalone. The toxicological findings observed appear to have no relevance to human therapeutic use. \n \nToxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters \n(erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea \nnitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the \njuxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury. Gastric lesions could be prevented/ameliorated by \noral sodium chloride solution supplementation and group housing of animals. In dogs renal tubular \ndilation and atrophy were observed. These findings are considered to be due to the pharmacological \nactivity of telmisartan. \n \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed. \nTelmisartan showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies \nand no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. Studies with hydrochlorothiazide have shown \nequivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect in some experimental models. However, the \nextensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association between its \nuse and an increase in neoplasms. \nFor the foetotoxic potential of the telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination see section 4.6. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nActelsar HCT 80 mg/25 mg tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 80 mg telmisartan and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \n \nActelsar HCT 80 mg/25 mg tablets are white or almost white, 9.0 x 17.0 mm oval-shaped and \nbiconvex tablets marked with “TH” on one side and “25” on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \n \nActelsar HCT fixed dose combination (80 mg telmisartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in \nadults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on Actelsar HCT 80 mg/12.5 mg \n(80 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) or adults who have been previously stabilised on \ntelmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nActelsar HCT should be taken in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by \ntelmisartan alone. Individual dose titration with each of the two components is recommended before \nchanging to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy \nto the fixed combination may be considered. \n \n- Actelsar HCT 80 mg/25 mg may be administered once daily in patients whose blood pressure is \n\nnot adequately controlled by Actelsar HCT 80 mg/12.5 mg or in patients who have been \npreviously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately. \n\n \nActelsar HCT is also available at the dose strengths 40 mg/12.5 mg and 80 mg/12.5 mg \n \nSpecial populations: \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nPeriodic monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed Actelsar HCT \n40 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Actelsar HCT is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nThiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 4.4). \n \nElderly patients \n \nNo dose adjustment is necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Actelsar HCT in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nActelsar HCT tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or \nwithout food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a \n\nsulphonamide-derived medicinal product). \n- Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n- Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. \n- Severe hepatic impairment. \n- Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). \n- Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia. \n \nThe concomitant use of Actelsar HCT with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPregnancy \n \nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and \n4.6). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nActelsar HCT should not be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe \nhepatic insufficiency (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These \npatients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. \n \nIn addition, Actelsar HCT should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or \nprogressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Actelsar HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nRenovascular hypertension \n \nThere is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal \nproducts that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation \n \nActelsar HCT must not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n<30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). There is no experience regarding the administration of \ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with recent kidney transplantation. Experience with \ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide is modest in the patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, \ntherefore periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended. \nThiazide diuretic associated azotaemia may occur in patients with impaired renal function. \n \nIntravascular hypovolaemia \n \nSymptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before the administration of Actelsar HCT. \n \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) \n \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). \nIf dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \n \nOther conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system \n \nIn patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal \ndisease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has \nbeen associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPrimary aldosteronism \n \nPatients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products \nacting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n \nAs with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral \nstenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects \n \nThiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance, whereas hypoglycaemia may occur in diabetic patients \nunder insulin or antidiabetic therapy and telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients blood \nglucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be \nrequired, when indicated. Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nAn increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels has been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever, at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Actelsar HCT, minimal or no effects were reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in some patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance \n \nAs for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be \nperformed at appropriate intervals. \n \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (including \nhypokalaemia, hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte \nimbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or \ncramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as \nnausea or vomiting (see section 4.8). \n \n- Hypokalaemia \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \ntelmisartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients \nwith cirrhosis of liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate \noral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or \nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see section 4.5). \n \n- Hyperkalaemia \nConversely, due to the antagonism of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptors by the telmisartan component \nof Actelsar HCT, hyperkalaemia might occur. Although clinically significant hyperkalaemia has not \nbeen documented with Actelsar HCT, risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal \ninsufficiency and/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium \nsupplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with \nActelsar HCT (see section 4.5). \n \n- Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis \nThere is no evidence that Actelsar HCT would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. \nChloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \n \n- Hypercalcaemia \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \n \n- Hypomagnesaemia \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnesaemia (see section 4.5). \n \nEthnic differences \n \nAs with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan is apparently less effective in \nlowering blood pressure in black patients than in non blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of \nlow renin states in the black hypertensive population. \n \nOther \n \nAs with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic \ncardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nGeneral \n \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. Exacerbation or \nactivation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide diuretics, \nincluding hydrochlorothiazide. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8). If a \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a \nre-administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to \nthe sun or to artificial UVA. \n \nChoroidal effusion, acute Myopia and Angle-Closure Glaucoma \n \nHydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in choroidal \neffusion with visual field defect, acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms \ninclude acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks \nof telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to \npermanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as \npossible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure \nremains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history \nof sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \n \nAn increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) [basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \ncell carcinoma (SCC)] with increasing cumulative dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) exposure has \nbeen observed in two epidemiological studies based on the Danish National Cancer Registry. \nPhotosensitizing actions of HCTZ could act as a possible mechanism for NMSC. \nPatients taking HCTZ should be informed of the risk of NMSC and advised to regularly check their \nskin for any new lesions and promptly report any suspicious skin lesions. Possible preventive \nmeasures such as limited exposure to sunlight and UV rays and, in case of exposure, adequate \nprotection should be advised to the patients in order to minimize the risk of skin cancer. Suspicious \nskin lesions should be promptly examined potentially including histological examinations of biopsies. \nThe use of HCTZ may also need to be reconsidered in patients who have experienced previous NMSC \n(see also section 4.8). \n \nExcipient(s) \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLithium \n \nReversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Rare cases have \nalso been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including \ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide). Co-administration of lithium and Actelsar HCT is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is \nrecommended during concomitant use. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nMedicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, \nlaxatives, corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin, carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium, salicylic acid and \nderivatives) \n \nIf these substances are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, \nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. These medicinal products may potentiate the effect \nof hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium (see section 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products that may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, \npotassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, cyclosporin \nor other medicinal products such as heparin sodium). \n \nIf these medicinal products are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, \nmonitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised. Based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of the above medicinal \nproducts may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section \n4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances \n \nPeriodic monitoring of serum potassium and ECG is recommended when Actelsar HCT is \nadministered with medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis \nglycosides, antiarrhythmics) and the following torsades de pointes inducing medicinal products (which \ninclude some antiarrhythmics), hypokalaemia being a predisposing factor to torsades de pointes. \n- class Ia antiarrythmics (e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide) \n- class III antiarrythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) \n- some antipsychotics (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, trifluoperazine, \n\ncyamemazine, sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol) \n- others (e.g. bepridil, cisapride, diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, \n\npentamidine, sparfloxacine, terfenadine, vincamine IV) \n \nDigitalis glycosides \n \nThiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favours the onset of digitalis-induced \narrhythmia (see section 4.4). \n \nDigoxin \n \nWhen telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma \nconcentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and \ndiscontinuing telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic \nrange. \n \nOther antihypertensive agents \n \nTelmisartan may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents. \n \nClinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) \nthrough the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated \nwith a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal \nfunction (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see \nsections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulin) \n \nDose adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal products may be required (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nMetformin \n \nMetformin should be used with precaution: risk of lactic acidosis induced by a possible functional \nrenal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nCholestyramine and colestipol resins \n \nAbsorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) \n \nNSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dose regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and \nnon-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide \ndiuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \nIn some patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with \ncompromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents \nthat inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible \nacute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the combination should be administered with \ncaution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be \ngiven to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically \nthereafter. \n \nIn one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the \nAUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline) \n \nThe effect of pressor amines may be decreased. \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine) \n \nThe effect of nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nMedicinal products used in the treatment for gout (e.g. probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and allopurinol) \n \nDose adjustment of uricosuric medicinal products may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise \nthe level of serum uric acid. Increase in dose of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary. \nCo-administration of thiazide may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions of allopurinol. \n \nCalcium salts \n \nThiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to the decreased excretion. If calcium \nsupplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be prescribed, serum \ncalcium levels should be monitored and calcium dose adjusted accordingly. \n \nBeta-blockers and diazoxide \n \nThe hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides. \n \nAnticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-type \ndiuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. \n \nAmantadine \n \nThiazides may increase the risk of adverse events caused by amantadine. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nCytotoxic agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) \n \nThiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \nBased on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products \nmay potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, \namifostine. \nFurthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\nThe use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of \npregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during \nthe second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \nThere are no adequate data from the use of Actelsar HCT in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II \nreceptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal products. Unless continued \nangiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should \nbe changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use \nin pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should \nbe stopped immediately, and if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known \nto induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification \nretardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). Should \nexposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, \nultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for \nhypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThere is limited experience with hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, especially during the first \ntrimester. Animal studies are insufficient. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide its use during the second and third \ntrimester may compromise foeto-placental perfusion and may cause foetal and neonatal effects like \nicterus, disturbance of electrolyte balance and thrombocytopenia. Hydrochlorothiazide should not be \nused for gestational oedema, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia due to the risk of decreased \nplasma volume and placental hypoperfusion, without a beneficial effect on the course of the disease. \nHydrochlorothiazide should not be used for essential hypertension in pregnant women except in rare \nsituations where no other treatment could be used. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of telmisartan during breast-feeding, Actelsar \nHCT is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during \nbreast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.  \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted in human milk in small amounts. Thiazides in high doses causing \nintense diuresis can inhibit the milk production. The use of hydrochlorothiazide during breast feeding \n\n\n\n30 \n\nis not recommended. If hydrochlorothiazide is used during breast-feeding, doses should be kept as low \nas possible. \n \nFertility \n \nIn preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide on male and female fertility \nwere observed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nActelsar HCT can have influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness or drowsiness \nmay occasionally occur when taking Actelsar HCT. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n Summary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reaction is dizziness.

Japanese patients are more likely to experience these \nadverse reactions. \n \nSepsis \nIn the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with \nplacebo. The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nInterstitial lung disease \nCases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal \nassociation with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited information available for telmisartan with regard to overdose in humans. The degree \nto which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established. \n \nSymptoms \nThe most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia, dizziness, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been \nreported. Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common signs and \nsymptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and/or \naccentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain \nanti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nTreatment \nTelmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the \ntreatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion \nand the severity of the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric \nlavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and \ncreatinine should be monitored frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a \nsupine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II antagonists \nand diuretics, ATC code: C09DA07 \n \nActelsar HCT is a combination of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a thiazide \ndiuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive \neffect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone. Actelsar HCT once \ndaily produces effective and smooth reductions in blood pressure across the therapeutic dose range. \n \nMechanism of action \nTelmisartan is an orally effective and specific angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist. \nTelmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor \nsubtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any \npartial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The \nbinding is long-lasting. Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and \nother less characterised AT receptors. The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the \neffect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. \nPlasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma \nrenin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), \nthe enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore, it is not expected to potentiate \nbradykinin-mediated adverse events. \nAn 80 mg dose of telmisartan administered to healthy volunteers almost completely inhibits the \nangiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and \nstill measurable up to 48 hours. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides have an effect on the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte \nreabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent \namounts. The diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin \nactivity, increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and \nbicarbonate loss, and decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system, co-administration of telmisartan tends to reverse the potassium loss \nassociated with these diuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak \neffect occurs at about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension \nAfter the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within \n3 hours. The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4-8 weeks after the start of \ntreatment and is sustained during long-term therapy. The antihypertensive effect persists constantly \nover 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory \nblood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by measurements made at the point of maximum \neffect and immediately prior to the next dose (through to peak ratios consistently above 80% after \ndoses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies). \n \nIn patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without \naffecting pulse rate. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents \nrepresentative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials \ncomparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). \n \nIn a double-blind controlled clinical trial (n=687 patients evaluated for efficacy) in non-responders to \nthe 80 mg/12.5 mg combination, an incremental blood pressure lowering effect of the 80 mg/25 mg \n\n\n\n36 \n\ncombination compared to continued treatment with the 80 mg/12.5 mg combination of 2.7/1.6 mm Hg \n(SBP/DBP) was demonstrated (difference in adjusted mean changes from baseline). In a follow-up \ntrial with the 80 mg/25 mg combination, blood pressure was further decreased (resulting in an overall \nreduction of 11.5/9.9 mm Hg (SBP/DBP). \n \nIn a pooled analysis of two similar 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials vs. \nvalsartan/hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/25 mg (n=2,121 patients evaluated for efficacy) a significantly \ngreater blood pressure lowering effect of 2.2/1.2 mm Hg (SBP/DBP) was demonstrated (difference in \nadjusted mean changes from baseline, respectively) in favour of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n80 mg/25 mg combination. \n \nUpon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment \nvalues over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. \nThe incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those \ngiven angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two \nantihypertensive treatments. \n \nCardiovascular prevention \nONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) \ncompared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on \ncardiovascular outcomes in 25,620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery \ndisease, stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence \nof end-organ damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), \nwhich is a population at risk for cardiovascular events. \n \nPatients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n=8542), \nramipril 10 mg (n=8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n=8502), and \nfollowed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years. \n \nTelmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for \ncongestive heart failure. The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7%) \nand ramipril (16.5%) groups. The hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5% CI \n0.93-1.10, p (non-inferiority)=0.0019 at a margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6% and \n11.8% among telmisartan and ramipril treated patients, respectively. \n \nTelmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of \ncardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5% CI 0.90-1.08), \np (non-inferiority) =0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart Outcomes \nPrevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo. \n \nTRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as \nONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. \nThe mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the \nincidence of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, \nnon-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7% in the telmisartan \nand 17.0% in the placebo groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.81-1.05, p=0.22)]. There was \nevidence for a benefit of telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary composite \nendpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95% CI \n0.76-1.00, p=0.048)]. There was no evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio \n1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.24). \n \nTwo large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in \ncombination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs \nNephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an \nangiotensin II receptor blocker. \n\n\n\n37 \n\nONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular \ndisease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. For more detailed \ninformation see above under the heading “Cardiovascular prevention”. \nVA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. \nThese studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and \nmortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as \ncompared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these \nresults are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. \n \nALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) \nwas a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor \nor an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney \ndisease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk \nof adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the \naliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest \n(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren \ngroup than in the placebo group. \n \nCough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in \npatients treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan. \n \nCombining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV \nmortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was \na significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the \ncombination arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended \nin this population. \n \nIn the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients \n50 years and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for \ntelmisartan compared with placebo, 0.70% vs. 0.49% [RR 1.43 (95% confidence interval 1.00-2.06)]; \nthe incidence of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33%) vs. patients \ntaking placebo (0.16%) [RR 2.07 (95% confidence interval 1.14-3.76)]. The observed increased \noccurrence rate of sepsis associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance finding or \nrelated to a mechanism not currently known. \n \nEpidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with hydrochlorothiazide reduces the \nrisk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThe effects of fixed dose combination of telmisartan/HCT on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity \nare currently unknown. \n \nNon-melanoma skin cancer: \nBased on available data from epidemiological studies, cumulative dose-dependent association between \nHCTZ and NMSC has been observed. One study included a population comprised of 71,533 cases of \nBCC and of 8,629 cases of SCC matched to 1,430,833 and 172,462 population controls, respectively. \nHigh HCTZ use (≥50,000 mg cumulative) was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23-\n1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI: 3.68-4.31) for SCC. A clear cumulative dose response relationship \nwas observed for both BCC and SCC. Another study showed a possible association between lip cancer \n(SCC) and exposure to HCTZ: 633 cases of lip-cancer were matched with 63,067 population controls, \nusing a risk-set sampling strategy. A cumulative dose-response relationship was demonstrated with an \nadjusted OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.6) increasing to OR 3.9 (3.0-4.9) for high use (~25,000 mg) and OR \n7.7 (5.7-10.5) for the highest cumulative dose (~100,000 mg) (see also section 4.4). \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \ntelmisartan hydrochlorothiazide in all subsets of the paediatric population in hypertension (see section \n4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan does not appear to affect the \npharmacokinetics of either substance in healthy subjects. \n \nAbsorption \nTelmisartan: Following oral administration, peak concentrations of telmisartan are reached in 0.5-1.5 h \nafter dosing. The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan at 40 mg and 160 mg was 42% and 58%, \nrespectively. Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan with a reduction in the area under \nthe plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 19% after a \n160 mg dose. By 3 hours after administration plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is \ntaken fasting or with food. The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the \ntherapeutic efficacy. Telmisartan does not accumulate significantly in plasma on repeated \nadministration. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: Following oral administration of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide, peak \nconcentrations of hydrochlorothiazide are reached in approximately 1.0-3.0 hours after dosing. Based \non cumulative renal excretion of hydrochlorothiazide the absolute bioavailability was about 60%. \n \nDistribution \nTelmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99.5%) mainly albumin and alpha l-acid \nglycoprotein. The apparent volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 litres \nindicating additional tissue binding. \nHydrochlorothiazide is 68% protein bound in the plasma and its apparent volume of distribution is \n0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nBiotransformation \nTelmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide. The \nglucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in humans. After a \nsingle dose of 14C-labelled telmisartan the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured \nradioactivity in plasma. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of \ntelmisartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolised in man. \n \nElimination \nTelmisartan: Following either intravenous or oral administration of 14C-labelled telmisartan most of \nthe administered dose (>97%) was eliminated in faeces via biliary excretion. Only minute amounts \nwere found in urine. Total plasma clearance of telmisartan after oral administration is >1500 ml/min. \nTerminal elimination half-life was >20 hours. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is excreted almost entirely as unchanged substance in urine. About 60% of the \noral dose is eliminated within 48 hours. Renal clearance is about 250-300 ml/min. The terminal \nelimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide is 10-15 hours. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nTelmisartan: The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are non-linear over doses from \n20–160 mg with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) with \nincreasing doses. \nHydrochlorothiazide exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nElderly \nPharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years. \n \nGender \nPlasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2-3 times higher in females than in males. In \nclinical trials however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of \northostatic hypotension were found in women. No dose adjustment is necessary. There was a trend \ntowards higher plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in female than in male subjects. This is \nnot considered to be of clinical relevance. \n \nRenal impairment \nRenal excretion does not contribute to the clearance of telmisartan. Based on modest experience in \npatients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/min, mean about \n50 ml/min) no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function. Telmisartan is \nnot removed from blood by haemodialysis. In patients with impaired renal function the rate of \nhydrochlorothiazide elimination is reduced. In a typical study in patients with a mean creatinine \nclearance of 90 ml/min the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was increased. In functionally \nanephric patients the elimination half-life is about 34 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute \nbioavailability up to nearly 100%. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn preclinical safety studies performed with co-administration of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide \nin normotensive rats and dogs, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic \nrange caused no additional findings not already observed with administration of either substance \nalone. The toxicological findings observed appear to have no relevance to human therapeutic use. \n \nNo additional preclinical studies have been performed with the Fixed Dose Combination product \n80 mg/25 mg. Previous preclinical safety studies performed with co-administration of telmisartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide in normotensive rats and dogs, in doses producing exposure comparable to that in \nthe clinical therapeutic range, caused no additional findings not already observed with administration \nof either substance alone. The toxicological findings observed appear to have no relevance to human \ntherapeutic use. \n \nToxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters \n(erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea \nnitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the \njuxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury. Gastric lesions could be prevented/ameliorated by \noral sodium chloride solution supplementation and group housing of animals. In dogs renal tubular \ndilation and atrophy were observed. These findings are considered to be due to the pharmacological \nactivity of telmisartan. \n \nNo clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an \neffect on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye \nopening was observed. \nTelmisartan showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies \nand no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. Studies with hydrochlorothiazide have shown \nequivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect in some experimental models. However, the \nextensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association between its \nuse and an increase in neoplasms. \nFor the foetotoxic potential of the telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination see section 4.6. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n  \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nActelsar HCT 40 mg/12.5 mg tablets \n\ntelmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Actelsar HCT is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Actelsar HCT \n3. How to take Actelsar HCT \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Actelsar HCT \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Actelsar HCT is and what it is used for \n \nActelsar HCT is a combination of two active substances, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in one \ntablet. Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \n\nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow \nthus increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the \nblood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. \n\n- Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause your \nurine output to increase, leading to a lowering of your blood pressure. \n\n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead \nsometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms \nof high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure \nto verify if it is within the normal range. \n \nActelsar HCT is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adults whose blood \npressure is not controlled enough when telmisartan is used alone. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Actelsar HCT \n \nDo not take Actelsar HCT \n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines. \n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Actelsar HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see pregnancy section). \n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease. \n- if you have severe kidney disease. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n- if your doctor determines that you have low potassium levels or high calcium levels in your \nblood that do not get better with treatment. \n\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \nlowering medicine containing aliskiren. \n\n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Actelsar HCT. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of \nthe following conditions or illnesses: \n \n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nvomiting, or haemodialysis. \n\n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n- Liver disease. \n- Heart trouble. \n- Diabetes. \n- Gout. \n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various \n\nblood minerals). \n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”) a disease where the body’s \n\nimmune system attacks the body. \n- The active substance hydrochlorothiazide can cause an unusual reaction, resulting in a decrease \n\nin vision and eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of \nthe eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye and can happen within hours \nto weeks of taking Actelsar HCT. This can lead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase \nthe risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin \nfrom sun exposure and UV rays while taking Actelsar HCT  \n\n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT, if you are taking: \n- any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n- aliskiren. \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes \n(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading “Do \nnot take Actelsar HCT”. \n\n- digoxin. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body. Typical symptoms \nof fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, \nmuscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart \nrate (faster than 100 beats per minute). If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with \nsymptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than \nnormal. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Actelsar HCT. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nActelsar HCT may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Actelsar HCT in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Actelsar HCT \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Actelsar HCT: \n \n- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n- Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, (“water \n\ntablets”), laxatives (e.g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone), \namphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G \nsodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives. \n\n- Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as potassium-sparing diuretics, \npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, ACE inhibitors, cyclosporin (an \nimmunosuppressant drug) and other medicinal products such as heparin sodium (an \nanticoagulant). \n\n- Medicines that are affected by changes of the blood potassium level such as heart medicines \n(e.g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, \namiodarone, sotalol), medicines used for mental disorders (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, \nlevomepromazine) and other medicines such as certain antibiotics (e.g. sparfloxacine, \npentamidine) or certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine). \n\n- Medicines for the treatment of diabetes (insulins or oral agents such as metformin). \n- Cholestyramine and colestipol, medicines for lowering blood fat levels. \n- Medicines to increase blood pressure, such as noradrenaline. \n- Muscle relaxing medicines, such as tubocurarine. \n- Calcium supplements and/or vitamin D supplements. \n- Anti-cholinergic medicines (medicines used to treat a variety of disorders such as \n\ngastrointestinal cramps, urinary bladder spasm, asthma, motion sickness, muscular spasms, \nParkinson's disease and as an aid to anaesthesia) such as atropine and biperiden. \n\n- Amantadine (medicine used to treat Parkinson’s disease and also used to treat or prevent certain \nillnesses caused by viruses). \n\n- Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, corticosteroids, painkillers (such as non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), medicines to treat cancer, gout, or arthritis. \n\n- If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not \ntake Actelsar HCT” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n- Digoxin. \n \nActelsar HCT may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high \nblood pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). \nFurthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your \ndoctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Actelsar HCT. \n \nThe effect of Actelsar HCT may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. acetylsalicyl acid or ibuprofen). \n \nActelsar HCT with food and alcohol \n \nYou can take Actelsar HCT with or without food. \nAvoid taking alcohol until you have talked to your doctor. Alcohol may make your blood pressure fall \nmore and/or increase the risk of you becoming dizzy or feeling faint. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Actelsar HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Actelsar HCT. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Actelsar HCT. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or \noperate machinery. \n \nActelsar HCT contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to take Actelsar HCT \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. You can \ntake Actelsar HCT with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Actelsar HCT every day until your doctor tells you \notherwise. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg/12.5 mg once a day. \n \nIf you take more Actelsar HCT than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets you may experience symptoms such as low blood pressure \nand rapid heartbeat. Slow heartbeat, dizziness, vomiting, reduced kidney function including kidney \nfailure, have also been reported. Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, markedly low blood \npressure and low blood levels of potassium can also happen, which may result in nausea, sleepiness \nand muscle cramps and/or irregular heartbeat associated with the concomitant use of drugs such as \ndigitalis or certain anti-arrhythmic treatments. Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest \nhospital emergency department immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Actelsar HCT \nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember, then carry on as before. If \nyou do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What Actelsar HCT is and what it is used for \n \nActelsar HCT is a combination of two active substances, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in one \ntablet. Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \n\nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow \nthus increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the \nblood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. \n\n- Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause your \nurine output to increase, leading to a lowering of your blood pressure. \n\n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead \nsometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms \nof high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure \nto verify if it is within the normal range. \n \nActelsar HCT is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adults whose blood \npressure is not controlled enough when telmisartan is used alone. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Actelsar HCT \n \nDo not take Actelsar HCT \n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines. \n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Actelsar HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see pregnancy section). \n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease. \n- if you have severe kidney disease. \n\n\n\n83 \n\n- if your doctor determines that you have low potassium levels or high calcium levels in your \nblood that do not get better with treatment. \n\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \nlowering medicine containing aliskiren. \n\n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Actelsar HCT. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of \nthe following conditions or illnesses: \n \n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nvomiting, or haemodialysis. \n\n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n- Liver disease. \n- Heart trouble. \n- Diabetes. \n- Gout. \n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various \n\nblood minerals). \n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”) a disease where the body’s \n\nimmune system attacks the body. \n- The active substance hydrochlorothiazide can cause an unusual reaction, resulting in a decrease \n\nin vision and eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of \nthe eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye and can happen within hours \nto weeks of taking Actelsar HCT. This can lead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase \nthe risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin \nfrom sun exposure and UV rays while taking Actelsar HCT  \n\n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT if you are taking: \n- any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n- aliskiren. \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes \n(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading “Do \nnot take Actelsar HCT”. \n\n- digoxin. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body. Typical symptoms \nof fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, \nmuscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart \nrate (faster than 100 beats per minute). If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with \nsymptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than \nnormal. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Actelsar HCT. \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \nActelsar HCT may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Actelsar HCT in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Actelsar HCT \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Actelsar HCT: \n \n- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n- Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, (“water \n\ntablets”), laxatives (e.g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone), \namphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G \nsodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives. \n\n- Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as potassium-sparing diuretics, \npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, ACE inhibitors, cyclosporin (an \nimmunosuppressant drug) and other medicinal products such as heparin sodium (an \nanticoagulant). \n\n- Medicines that are affected by changes of the blood potassium level such as heart medicines \n(e.g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, \namiodarone, sotalol), medicines used for mental disorders (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, \nlevomepromazine) and other medicines such as certain antibiotics (e.g. sparfloxacine, \npentamidine) or certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine). \n\n- Medicines for the treatment of diabetes (insulins or oral agents such as metformin). \n- Cholestyramine and colestipol, medicines for lowering blood fat levels. \n- Medicines to increase blood pressure, such as noradrenaline. \n- Muscle relaxing medicines, such as tubocurarine. \n- Calcium supplements and/or vitamin D supplements. \n- Anti-cholinergic medicines (medicines used to treat a variety of disorders such as \n\ngastrointestinal cramps, urinary bladder spasm, asthma, motion sickness, muscular spasms, \nParkinson's disease and as an aid to anaesthesia) such as atropine and biperiden. \n\n- Amantadine (medicine used to treat Parkinson’s disease and also used to treat or prevent certain \nillnesses caused by viruses). \n\n- Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, corticosteroids, painkillers (such as non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), medicines to treat cancer, gout, or arthritis. \n\n- If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not \ntake Actelsar HCT” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n- Digoxin. \n \nActelsar HCT may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high \nblood pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). \nFurthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your \ndoctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Actelsar HCT. \n \nThe effect of Actelsar HCT may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. acetylsalicyl acid or ibuprofen). \n \nActelsar HCT with food and alcohol \n \nYou can take Actelsar HCT with or without food. \nAvoid taking alcohol until you have talked to your doctor. Alcohol may make your blood pressure fall \nmore and/or increase the risk of you becoming dizzy or feeling faint. \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Actelsar HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Actelsar HCT. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Actelsar HCT. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or \noperate machinery. \n \nActelsar HCT contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to take Actelsar HCT \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. You can \ntake Actelsar HCT with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Actelsar HCT every day until your doctor tells you \notherwise. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg/12.5 mg once a day. \n \nIf you take more Actelsar HCT than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets you may experience symptoms such as low blood pressure \nand rapid heartbeat. Slow heartbeat, dizziness, vomiting, reduced kidney function including kidney \nfailure, have also been reported. Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, markedly low blood \npressure and low blood levels of potassium can also happen, which may result in nausea, sleepiness \nand muscle cramps and/or irregular heartbeat associated with the concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts such as digitalis or certain anti-arrhythmic treatments. Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or \nyour nearest hospital emergency department immediately.  \n \nIf you forget to take Actelsar HCT \nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember, then carry on as before. If \nyou do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

What Actelsar HCT is and what it is used for \n \nActelsar HCT is a combination of two active substances, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in one \ntablet. Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure. \n \n- Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. \n\nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow \nthus increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the \nblood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. \n\n- Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause your \nurine output to increase, leading to a lowering of your blood pressure. \n\n \nHigh blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead \nsometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness. There are usually no symptoms \nof high blood pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure \nto verify if it is within the normal range. \n \nActelsar HCT is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adults whose blood \npressure is not controlled enough when telmisartan is used alone. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Actelsar HCT \n \nDo not take Actelsar HCT \n- if you are allergic to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you are allergic to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines. \n- if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Actelsar HCT in early \n\npregnancy – see pregnancy section). \n- if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with \n\ndrainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease. \n- if you have severe kidney disease. \n\n\n\n91 \n\n- if your doctor determines that you have low potassium levels or high calcium levels in your \nblood that do not get better with treatment. \n\n- if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure \nlowering medicine containing aliskiren. \n\n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Actelsar HCT. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of \nthe following conditions or illnesses: \n \n- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body \n\nwater) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, \nvomiting, or haemodialysis. \n\n- Kidney disease or kidney transplant. \n- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). \n- Liver disease. \n- Heart trouble. \n- Diabetes. \n- Gout. \n- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various \n\nblood minerals). \n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (also called “lupus” or “SLE”) a disease where the body’s \n\nimmune system attacks the body. \n- The active substance hydrochlorothiazide can cause an unusual reaction, resulting in a decrease \n\nin vision and eye pain. These could be symptoms of fluid accumulation in the vascular layer of \nthe eye (choroidal effusion) or an increase of pressure in your eye and can happen within hours \nto weeks of taking Actelsar HCT. This can lead to permanent vision impairment, if not treated. \n\n- if you have had skin cancer or if you develop an unexpected skin lesion during the treatment. \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide, particularly long term use with high doses, may increase \nthe risk of some types of skin and lip cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer). Protect your skin \nfrom sun exposure and UV rays while taking Actelsar HCT  \n\n \nTalk to your doctor before taking Actelsar HCT if you are taking: \n- any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: \n\n- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have \ndiabetes-related kidney problems. \n\n- aliskiren. \nYour doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes \n(e.g. potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. See also information under the heading “Do \nnot take Actelsar HCT”. \n\n- digoxin. \n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it \nmay cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). \n \nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body. Typical symptoms \nof fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, \nmuscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart \nrate (faster than 100 beats per minute). If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor. \n \nYou should also tell your doctor if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with \nsymptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than \nnormal. \n \nIn case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Actelsar HCT. \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \nActelsar HCT may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThe use of Actelsar HCT in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Actelsar HCT \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other \nprecautions. In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially \nto the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Actelsar HCT: \n \n- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. \n- Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, (“water \n\ntablets”), laxatives (e.g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone), \namphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G \nsodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives. \n\n- Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as potassium-sparing diuretics, \npotassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, ACE inhibitors, cyclosporin (an \nimmunosuppressant drug) and other medicinal products such as heparin sodium (an \nanticoagulant). \n\n- Medicines that are affected by changes of the blood potassium level such as heart medicines \n(e.g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, \namiodarone, sotalol), medicines used for mental disorders (e.g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, \nlevomepromazine) and other medicines such as certain antibiotics (e.g. sparfloxacine, \npentamidine) or certain medicines to treat allergic reactions (e.g. terfenadine). \n\n- Medicines for the treatment of diabetes (insulins or oral agents such as metformin). \n- Cholestyramine and colestipol, medicines for lowering blood fat levels. \n- Medicines to increase blood pressure, such as noradrenaline. \n- Muscle relaxing medicines, such as tubocurarine. \n- Calcium supplements and/or vitamin D supplements. \n- Anti-cholinergic medicines (medicines used to treat a variety of disorders such as \n\ngastrointestinal cramps, urinary bladder spasm, asthma, motion sickness, muscular spasms, \nParkinson's disease and as an aid to anaesthesia) such as atropine and biperiden. \n\n- Amantadine (medicine used to treat Parkinson’s disease and also used to treat or prevent certain \nillnesses caused by viruses). \n\n- Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, corticosteroids, painkillers (such as non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), medicines to treat cancer, gout, or arthritis. \n\n- If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not \ntake Actelsar HCT” and “Warnings and precautions”). \n\n- Digoxin. \n \nActelsar HCT may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high \nblood pressure or of medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. baclofen, amifostine). \nFurthermore, low blood pressure may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or \nantidepressants. You may notice this as dizziness when standing up. You should consult with your \ndoctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking Actelsar HCT. \n \nThe effect of Actelsar HCT may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory \nmedicines, e.g. acetylsalicyl acid or ibuprofen). \n \nActelsar HCT with food and alcohol \n \nYou can take Actelsar HCT with or without food. \nAvoid taking alcohol until you have talked to your doctor. Alcohol may make your blood pressure fall \nmore and/or increase the risk of you becoming dizzy or feeling faint. \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Actelsar HCT before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are \npregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Actelsar HCT. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended during pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may \ncause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Actelsar HCT is not \nrecommended for mothers who are breast-feeding and your doctor may choose another treatment for \nyou if you wish to breast-feed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people feel dizzy or tired when taking Actelsar HCT. If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or \noperate machinery. \n \nActelsar HCT contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to take Actelsar HCT \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same time each day. You can \ntake Actelsar HCT with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other \nnon-alcoholic drink. It is important that you take Actelsar HCT every day until your doctor tells you \notherwise. \n \nIf your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg/12.5 mg once a day. \n \nIf you take more Actelsar HCT than you should \nIf you accidentally take too many tablets you may experience symptoms such as low blood pressure \nand rapid heartbeat. Slow heartbeat, dizziness, vomiting, reduced kidney function including kidney \nfailure, have also been reported. Due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, markedly low blood \npressure and low blood levels of potassium can also happen, which may result in nausea, sleepiness \nand muscle cramps and/or irregular heartbeat associated with the concomitant use of medicinal \nproducts such as digitalis or certain anti-arrhythmic treatments. Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or \nyour nearest hospital emergency department immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Actelsar HCT \nIf you forget to take a dose, do not worry. Take it as soon as you remember, then carry on as before. If \nyou do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double \ndose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
