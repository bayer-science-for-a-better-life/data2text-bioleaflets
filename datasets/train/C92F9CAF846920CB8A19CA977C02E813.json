NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRaptiva 100 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains a retrievable amount of 125 mg of efalizumab. \nReconstitution with the solvent yields a solution containing efalizumab at 100 mg/ml. \n \nEfalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody produced in genetically engineered \nChinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Efalizumab is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin, containing \nhuman constant region sequences and murine light- and heavy-chain complementary determining \nregion sequences. \n \nExcipients: 2.5 mg polysorbate 20, 3.55 mg histidine, 5.70 mg histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, \n102.7 mg sucrose. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nThe powder is a white to off white cake. \nThe solvent is a clear, colourless liquid. \n \nThe pH of the reconstituted solution is 5.9 \u2013 6.5. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who have failed to \nrespond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including \nciclosporin, methotrexate and PUVA (see section 5.1 \u2013 Clinical Efficacy). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Raptiva should be initiated by a physician specialised in dermatology.  \n \nAn initial single dose of 0.7 mg/kg body weight is given followed by weekly injections of 1.0 mg/kg \nbody weight (maximum single dose should not exceed a total of 200 mg). The volume to be injected \nshould be calculated as follows:  \n \n\nDose Volume to be injected per \n10 kg body weight \n\nSingle initial dose: 0.7 mg/kg 0.07 ml \nSubsequent doses: 1 mg/kg 0.1 ml \n\n \nThe duration of therapy is 12 weeks. Therapy may be continued only in patients who responded to \ntreatment (PGA good or better). For discontinuation guidance see section 4.4. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\nChildren and adolescents (< 18 years) \nRaptiva is not recommended for use in children below age 18 due to a lack of data on safety and \nefficacy. \n \nUse in the elderly (\u2265 65 years) \nThe dosage and administration schedule in the elderly should be the same as for adults (see also \nsection 4.4). \n \nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment  \nNo studies have been conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Raptiva should be used \nwith caution in this patient population. \n \nMethod of administration \nRaptiva is for subcutaneous injection. Injection sites should be rotated. \nFor instructions for use see section 6.6. \n \nAfter proper training in the reconstitution and injection technique, patients may self-inject with \nRaptiva, if their physician determines that this is appropriate. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to efalizumab or to any of the excipients. \nPatients with history of malignancies. \nPatients with active tuberculosis and other severe infections. \nPatients with specific forms of psoriasis like guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis as sole or \npredominant form of psoriasis. \nPatients with immunodeficiencies. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEffects on the immune system \n \na) Infections \nRaptiva is a selective immunosuppressor that alters T-lymphocyte function and may affect host \ndefences against infections. It has the potential to increase the risk or the severity of infections, e.g. \ntuberculous pneumonia, and reactivate latent, chronic infections e.g. JC virus infection. \nPatients developing an infection during treatment with Raptiva should be monitored and according to \nseverity Raptiva should be discontinued. In a patient with history of clinically significant recurring \ninfections, Raptiva should be used with caution. \nThe use of Raptiva may be associated with an increased risk of Progressive Multifocal \nLeukoencephalopathy (PML). One case of JC virus infection resulting in PML has been reported in \npost-marketing surveillance in a patient with psoriasis receiving Raptiva (see section 4.8).  \n \nPatients must be monitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or \nsigns that may be suggestive of PML (such as impaired cognition, visual disturbances, hemiparesis, \naltered mental state or behavioural changes). If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended \nuntil PML has been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms \nare indicative of neurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive \nof PML. If any doubt exists, further evaluation, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan \npreferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC viral DNA and repeat neurological \nassessment, should be considered. Patients should also be advised to inform their partner or caregivers \nabout their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. \nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of Raptiva must be permanently discontinued. \n \nb) Vaccinations \nLimited data are available on the effects of vaccination. Neo-vaccinations given during treatment with \nRaptiva may induce antibody levels lower than those observed in non-treated subjects, but the clinical \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n4 \n\nsignificance of this is unknown. Patients should not receive live and live-attenuated vaccines while on \nRaptiva therapy. Before vaccination, treatment with Raptiva should be withheld for 8 weeks and can \nresume 2 weeks after vaccination. (see section 4.5). \n \nc) Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nIt is not yet known whether or not Raptiva can increase the risk of lymphoproliferative disorders or \nother malignancies in psoriasis patients. Raptiva should be discontinued if a malignancy develops \nwhile the patient is on treatment (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \nRaptiva has not been studied in combination with immunosuppressive systemic antipsoriasis medicinal \nproducts. Therefore, combination therapies with these products are not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nImmune-mediated haemolytic anaemia \nIn post-marketing surveillance, isolated cases of severe haemolytic anaemia have been reported during \ntreatment with Raptiva. In such circumstances, Raptiva should be discontinued.  \n \nThrombocytopenia \nThrombocytopenia may occur during Raptiva treatment and may be associated with clinical signs such \nas echymoses, spontaneous bruising or bleeding from muco-cutaneous tissues. If these manifestations \noccur, efalizumab should be stopped immediately, a platelet count should be performed and \nappropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately (see section 4.8). \nPlatelet counts are recommended upon initiating and periodically while receiving Raptiva treatment. It \nis recommended that assessments be more frequent when initiating therapy (e.g., monthly) and may \ndecrease in frequency with continued treatment (e.g., every 3 months). \n \nInflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy \nCases of inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy have been observed in post-marketing surveillance in \npatients receiving Raptiva (see section 4.8). Patients have recovered after discontinuation of Raptiva, \ntherefore Raptiva should be stopped following the diagnosis of inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy. \n \nHypersensitivity and allergic reactions \nAs with any recombinant product, Raptiva is potentially immunogenic. Consequently, if any serious \nhypersensitivity or allergic reaction occurs, Raptiva should be discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \n \nArthritis \nCases of arthritis have been observed during treatment or after discontinuation of Raptiva. It is \nrecommended to discontinue Raptiva if arthritis occurs during treatment. \n \nPsoriasis \nDuring treatment with Raptiva, cases of exacerbation of psoriasis, including pustular, erythrodermic, \nand guttate subtypes, have been observed (see section 4.8). In such cases, it is recommended to \ndiscontinue treatment with Raptiva. \nDiscontinuation of treatment may cause a recurrence or exacerbation of plaque psoriasis including \nerythrodermic and pustular psoriasis, especially in patients not responding to treatment. Gradual \nreduction of dose or frequency does not appear to be beneficial. \n \nDiscontinuation \nManagement of patients discontinuing Raptiva includes close observation. In case of recurrence or \nexacerbation of disease, as well as in patients who discontinue Raptiva and are non-responders, the \ntreating physician should institute the most appropriate psoriasis treatment as necessary. \nIn case re-treatment with Raptiva is indicated the same guidance should be followed as under \nPosology and method of administration. Re-treatment may be associated with lower or inadequate \nresponse to Raptiva than in the earlier treatment periods. Therapy may be continued only in those \npatients who respond adequately to treatment. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nSpecial patient populations \nNo differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly (\u2265 65 years) patients and younger \npatients. As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution \nshould be used in treating the elderly. \nRaptiva has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and should therefore be used \nwith caution in such patients. See section 4.8 regarding the effects on the hepatic function. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with Raptiva. \n \nLimited data are available on the effects of vaccination in patients receiving Raptiva.  \nIn a study of 66 patients with moderate plaque psoriasis, immune responses during and after Raptiva \ntreatment were investigated. Following booster vaccination with tetanus toxoid (recall antigen), the \nability to mount an immune response to the tetanus toxoid was preserved in those patients undergoing \nRaptiva therapy. After 35 days of treatment with Raptiva, the proportion of subjects treated with \nefalizumab with positive skin test reactions to Candida was significantly reduced compared with the \nplacebo group. Antibody response to an experimental neo-antigen (\u2205X174) was reduced during \nRaptiva therapy, but began to normalize 6 weeks after discontinuation of Raptiva therapy and did not \ndemonstrate tolerance induction. A pneumococcal vaccine administered 6 weeks after discontinuation \nof Raptiva yielded normal results. Neo-vaccinations given during treatment with Raptiva may induce \nantibody levels lower than non-treated subjects, but the clinical significance of this is unknown. \nPatients should not receive live and live-attenuated vaccines during Raptiva treatment. (See section \n4.4). \n \nGiven the mechanism of action of efalizumab, its effects on the immune system may be potentiated by \nsystemic immunosuppressives commonly used for the treatment of psoriasis (see section 4.4). \n \nRaptiva has been used in combination with topical corticosteroids in psoriasis patients without any \nuntoward effects nor with any observable significant beneficial effect of the combination therapy \nabove monotherapy with efalizumab. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nIn general, immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. There are no adequate data from \nthe use of efalizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies indicate an impairment of the immune \nfunction of the offspring (see section 5.3).  \n \nPregnant women should not be treated with Raptiva. \nWomen of childbearing potential have to use appropriate contraception during treatment. \n \nLactation \nExcretion of efalizumab in human milk has not been investigated, however immunoglobulins are \nexpected to be excreted in human milk. Moreover, an antibody analogue of efalizumab was shown to \nbe excreted in milk of mice. Women should not breastfeed during treatment with Raptiva. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on the \npharmacological mechanism of action of efalizumab, the use of Raptiva is not expected to affect \npatient\u2019s ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe most frequent symptomatic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed during Raptiva therapy were \nmild to moderate dose-related acute flu-like symptoms including headache, fever, chills, nausea and \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\nmyalgia. In large placebo-controlled clinical studies, these reactions were observed in approximately \n41% of Raptiva-treated patients and 24% in placebo-treated patients over 12 weeks of treatment. After \ninitiation of therapy, these reactions were generally less frequent and occurred at similar rates to that \nseen in the placebo group from the third and subsequent weekly injections. \nAntibodies to efalizumab were detected in only 6% of patients. In this small number of patients no \ndifferences were observed in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinically noteworthy adverse \nevents or clinical efficacy. \n \nAdverse events (Preferred Terms) in the overall population studied clinically with Raptiva are listed \nbelow by frequency of occurrence and by MedDRA System Organ Class. Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Very \ncommon \n (>1/10) \n\nCommon \n (>1/100<1/10) \n\nUncommon \n(>1/1,000, \n\n<1/100) \n\nRare \n(>1/10,000, \n<1/1,000) \n\nVery rare \n(<1/10,000) \n\nNot known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\n     Aseptic meningitis*, \nSevere infections*, \nJC virus infection \nresulting in \nprogressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy* \n\nBlood and the \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nLeuko-\ncytosis and \nlympho-\ncytosis  \n\n Thrombo-\ncytopenia  \n\n  Immune mediated \nhaemolytic anaemia*\n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n Hyper-\nsensitivity \nreactions \n\n    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n  Facial palsy \n(Bell\u2019s \npalsy) \n\n  Inflammatory \npolyradiculo-\nneuropathy* \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n     Interstitial \npneumonitis* \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Psoriasis Urticaria   Erythema \nmultiforme* \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Arthralgia \nArthritis / \nPsoriatic \narthritis \n(exacerbation/\nflare) \n\n    \n\nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nFlu-like \nsymptoms \nincluding \nfever, \nheadaches, \nchills, \nnausea and \nmyalgia  \n\nBack pain, \nAsthenia \n\nInjection site \nreactions \n \n\n   \n\nInvestigations  Elevation of \nalkaline \nPhosphatase, \nElevation of \nALT  \n\n    \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n7 \n\n* Events identified during postmarketing surveillance \n \nThe safety profile in the target population as defined in section 4.1 is similar to the safety profile in the \noverall population treated during clinical development of Raptiva as presented above. \n \nAdditional Information \n \nLong-term exposure: \nAnalysis following long-term use in a cohort of 339 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \nreceiving Raptiva 1 mg/kg/week, of which 166 patients have been treated for more than 2 years and up \nto 3 years, did not show any noteworthy differences in frequency of adverse events as compared to 12 \nweeks of exposure to Raptiva. Leucocytosis and lymphocytosis: in large placebo-controlled and in \nlong-term clinical studies, between 40 and 50% of patients developed sustained asymptomatic \nlymphocytosis during Raptiva therapy. All values were between 2.5 fold and 3.5 fold the ULN (Upper \nLimit of Normal). Lymphocyte count returned to baseline after therapy discontinuation. Slight \nelevation in absolute neutrophil count and eosinophil count were observed but in a smaller proportion \nof patients. \n \nThrombocytopenia:  \nIn the combined safety database of 3291 Raptiva-treated patients at the time of approval, there were \nnine occurrences (0.3%) of thrombocytopenia with less than 52,000 cells per \u03bcl reported. Four of these \npatients had clinical signs of thrombocytopenia. Based on available platelet count measurements, the \nonset of platelet decline was between 8 and 12 weeks after the first dose of Raptiva in 5 patients, but \noccurred later in the other patients. In one patient, thrombocytopenia occurred 3 weeks after treatment \ndiscontinuation. Over long term treatment up to 3 years, a small and gradual decrease in mean platelet \ncounts within the normal range was observed. In the same population two cases of severe \nthrombocytopenia (0.6%) of rapid onset were observed (See section 4.4). \n \nPsoriasis:  \nIn the first 12 weeks of placebo-controlled studies, the rate of psoriasis adverse events was 3.2% in the \nRaptiva-treated patients and 1.4% in the placebo-treated patients. Among 3291 patients in the \ncombined safety database, 39 patients presented an erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis (1.2%). \nSeventeen of these events occurred after discontinuation of Raptiva, while 22 occurred during \ntreatment. In the cases occurring during treatment, most of these events (16/22) occurred in patients \npresenting no response to Raptiva. Cases occurring after discontinuation were observed both in \npatients responding or not responding to Raptiva treatment. \n \nArthritis / Psoriatic arthritis:  \nIn the first 12 weeks of placebo-controlled studies, arthritis and exacerbation or flare of arthritis were \nobserved in 1.8% of Raptiva-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. In these studies, the \nincidence of other types of arthritis-related adverse events were similar between the Raptiva and \nplacebo groups. \n \nFlu-like symptoms:  \nIn large placebo-controlled clinical studies, approximately 20% of patients in excess of placebo \nreported flu-like symptoms including headaches, chills, fever, nausea and myalgia. The percentage of \npatients reporting flu-like symptoms was greatest with the first injection and decreased by more than \n50% with the second injection. These symptoms diminished thereafter to a percentage comparable to \nthat of patients treated with placebo. Headache was the most frequent of the flu-like symptoms. None \nof those events was serious and less than 5% were considered severe. Overall less than 1% of patients \ndiscontinued therapy because of acute flu-like symptoms. \n \nHypersensitivity and allergic disorders:  \nIn large placebo-controlled clinical studies, the percentage of patients experiencing an adverse event \nsuggestive of hypersensitivity, including urticaria, rash and allergic reactions was slightly higher in the \nRaptiva group (8%) than in the placebo group (7%). (See section 4.4). Over long term treatment, the \nfrequency of hypersensitivity-related adverse events did not increase. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n8 \n\n \nElevation of alkaline phosphatase:  \nIn large placebo-controlled clinical studies approximately 4.5% of patients developed sustained \nelevation of alkaline phosphatase throughout Raptiva therapy compared to 1% in placebo patients. All \nvalues were between 1.5 fold and 3 fold the ULN, and returned to baseline levels after therapy \ndiscontinuation. \n \nElevation of ALT: \nAbout 5.7% of patients developed elevation in ALT during Raptiva therapy compared to 3.5% in \nplacebo. All occurrences were asymptomatic and values above 2.5 fold ULN were not more frequent \nin the Raptiva group than in the placebo group. All values returned to baseline levels upon therapy \ndiscontinuation. \n \nInfections:  \nOther therapies that alter T-lymphocyte function have been associated with increased risk of \ndeveloping serious infections. In placebo controlled clinical trials, infection rates in Raptiva-treated \npatients was approximately 27.3% versus 24.0% in placebo-treated patients. In the target population \nstudied in study IMP24011, the infection rate in Raptiva-treated patients was approximately 25.7% \nversus 22.3% in placebo-treated patients.  \nAs regards serious infections, the overall incidence in both controlled and uncontrolled studies of up to \n12 weeks was 2.8 per 100 patient-years for Raptiva-treated patients compared with 1.4 per \n100 patient-years for placebo-treated patients. The most frequent serious infections were pneumonia, \ncellulitis, infections not otherwise specified and sepsis. Over long term treatment, the incidence of \nserious infection was 1.8 per 100 patient years (see section 4.). \nJC virus infection resulting in PML has been reported in post-marketing surveillance in a patient with \npsoriasis receiving Raptiva (see section 4.4). \n \nClass adverse reactions \n \nNeoplasms benign and malignant:  \nA higher rate of malignancies has been associated with therapies affecting the immune system. In \nplacebo controlled clinical trials, the overall incidences of malignancy (the majority of which were \nnon-melanoma skin cancers) were similar in Raptiva-treated patients and in placebo-treated patients. \nIn addition, the incidences of specific tumours in Raptiva patients were in line with those observed in \ncontrol psoriasis populations.  \n \nThere was no evidence of an increased risk of any particular malignancy over time with the exception \nof non-melanoma skin cancer (0.3 vs. 0.9 per 100 patient-years, short term and long term treatment, \nrespectively) (See section 4.4). \n \nInflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy:  \nIsolated cases have been observed during post-marketing surveillance. (See section 4.4). \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn a clinical study, where subjects were exposed to higher doses of efalizumab (up to 10 mg/kg \nintravenous), one subject receiving 3 mg/kg intravenous dose experienced hypertension, chills, and \nfever on the day of study drug dosing, which required hospitalization. Another subject who received \n10 mg/kg intravenous dose experienced severe vomiting following administration of efalizumab, \nwhich also required hospitalization. Both occurrences fully resolved without any sequelae. Doses up to \n4 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for 10 weeks have been administered without any toxic effect. \n \nThere is no known antidote to Raptiva or any specific treatment for Raptiva overdose other than \nwithholding treatment and patient observation. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient \nbe monitored under close medical care and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: selective immunosuppressive agents, ATC code: L04AA21 \n \nMechanism of action \nEfalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the CD11a \nsubunit of LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1), a leukocyte cell surface protein. \n \nBy this mechanism, efalizumab inhibits the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, which interferes with T \nlymphocytes adhesion to other cell types. LFA-1 is present on activated T lymphocytes, and ICAM-1 \nis up-regulated on endothelial cells and keratinocytes in psoriasis plaques. By preventing \nLFA-1/ICAM binding, efalizumab may alleviate signs and symptoms of psoriasis by inhibiting several \nstages in the immunologic cascade. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nIn studies using an initial dose of 0.7 mg/kg followed by 11 weekly doses of 1.0 mg/kg, efalizumab \nmaximally reduced expression of CD11a on circulating T lymphocytes to approximately 15-30% of \npre-dose baseline values and saturated CD11a to <5% of baseline available CD11a binding sites. The \nfull effect was seen 24 to 48 hours after the first dose, and was maintained between weekly doses. \nWithin 5 to 8 weeks following the 12th and final dose of efalizumab administered at 1.0 mg/kg/wk, \nCD11a levels returned to within a range of \u00b125% of baseline values. \n \nAnother pharmacodynamic marker, consistent with the mechanism of action of efalizumab, was the \nincrease in the absolute counts of circulating leukocytes observed during efalizumab treatment. \nIncreased absolute counts were apparent within 24 hours of the first dose, remained elevated with \nweekly dosing, and returned to baseline after treatment cessation. The largest increase occurred in the \nabsolute count of circulating lymphocytes. In clinical trials, mean lymphocyte counts approximately \ndoubled relative to baseline in subjects receiving 1.0 mg/kg/wk of Raptiva. The increase included \nCD4 T-lymphocytes, CD8 T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, although NK \ncells and CD4 cells increased less relative to other cell types. At a dose of 1.0 mg/kg/wk subcutaneous \nefalizumab, lymphocyte levels returned to within 10% of baseline by 8 weeks post last dose. \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of Raptiva versus other systemic therapies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis \nhas not been evaluated in studies directly comparing Raptiva with other systemic therapies. The \npresent results of Raptiva versus placebo over 12 weeks of treatment with different populations \nindicate a PASI 75 response to Raptiva in 22% to 39% of patients (see Table 2). Based on the clinical \ndevelopment data generated (see Table 1) and long-term experience, Raptiva is recommended for use \nin patients as defined in section 4.1.  \n \nFailure on prior systemic therapies is defined as insufficient response (PASI < 50 or PGA less than \ngood), or worsening of disease in patients while on treatment, and who were adequately dosed for a \nsufficiently long duration to assess response with at least each of the 3 major systemic therapies as \navailable. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Raptiva in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients has been \ndemonstrated in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials at the recommended dose \n(n=1742). There are no comparative data with Raptiva versus other systemic psoriasis therapies. The \nlargest study IMP24011 (n=793) included patients (n=526) who were not controlled by, \ncontraindicated to, or intolerant to two or more systemic therapies as judged from the patients\u2019 \nhistories of psoriasis treatment.

In study IMP24011, approximately half of the patients \n(46.8%) who were partial responders (50% to 74% improvement on PASI, similar to PGA good) after \n12 weeks of Raptiva treatment achieved a PASI 75 response at week 24. \n \nLong-term treatment: \nData from extended treatment (more than 12 weeks) have been obtained from 4311 patients in open \nlabel uncontrolled studies. Over 600 patients have been treated for more than 1 year including \n166 patients treated for more than 2 years and up to 3 years. Approximately half of the patients treated \nfor more than 1 year were PASI 75 responders (when all dropouts were considered as non-responders).  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption:  \nAfter subcutaneous administration of efalizumab peak plasma concentrations are reached after 1-\n2 days. Comparison with intravenous data indicated an average bioavailability of about 50% at the \nrecommended dose level of 1.0 mg/kg/wk subcutaneous. \n \nDistribution:  \nSteady state was achieved at week 4. At the 1 mg/kg/wk dose level (with an initial dose of 0.7 mg/kg \nthe first week), mean efalizumab plasma trough values were 11.1\u00b17.9 \u00b5g/ml. Measurements of volume \nof distribution of the central compartment after single intravenous doses were 110 ml/kg at dose \n0.03 mg/kg and 58 ml/kg at dose 10 mg/kg. \n \nBiotransformation:  \nThe metabolism of efalizumab is through internalisation followed by intracellular degradation as a \nconsequence of either binding to cell surface CD11a or through endocytosis. The expected degradation \nproducts are small peptides and individual amino acids which are eliminated by glomerular filtration. \nCytochrome P450 enzymes as well as conjugation reactions are not involved in the metabolism of \nefalizumab. \n \nElimination: \nEfalizumab is cleared by nonlinear saturable elimination (dose dependent). Mean steady state \nclearance is 24 ml/kg/day (range 5-76 ml/kg/day) at 1 mg/kg/ week subcutaneous. \nThe elimination half-life was about 5.5-10.5 days at 1 mg/kg/ week subcutaneous. Tend at steady state \nis 25 days (range 13-35 days). Weight is the most significant covariate affecting efalizumab clearance. \n \nNon-linearity: \nEfalizumab shows dose-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics which can be explained by its saturable \nspecific binding to cell surface receptors CD11a. It appeared that the receptor mediated clearance of \nefalizumab was saturated when plasma efalizumab concentrations were above 1 \u03bcg/ml. \n \nThrough population pharmacokinetic analysis, weight was found to affect efalizumab clearance. \nCovariates as baseline PASI, baseline lymphocyte count and age had modest effects on clearance; \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\ngender and ethnic origin had no effect. The pharmacokinetics of efalizumab in paediatric patients have \nnot been studied. The effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of efalizumab has \nnot been studied. \n \nAntibodies to efalizumab were detected in only 6% of patients evaluated. In this small number of \npatients no differences were observed in either pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic parameters. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEfalizumab does not cross-react with CD11a from species other than humans and chimpanzees. \nTherefore, conventional non-clinical safety data with the medicinal product are limited and do not \nallow for a comprehensive safety assessment. Inhibitory effects were observed on the humoral and \nT-cell dependent immune responses. In pups of mice treated with an antibody analogue of efalizumab, \na decrease in T-cell dependent immunity was observed up to at least 11 weeks of age. Only at \n25 weeks of age was this decrease no longer significant. \nOtherwise, the effects observed in non-clinical studies could be related to the pharmacology of \nefalizumab. \nNo lymphomas were observed following 6 months treatment with an antibody analogue of efalizumab \nin a 6 months study with p53 +/+ wild type mice. \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in mice during organogenesis. \n \n \n6.

WHAT RAPTIVA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n \nRaptiva is a systemic psoriasis medicine. Systemic therapies are medicines taken orally or \nadministered by injection and thus will be present in and affect the whole body. \n \nRaptiva is a medicine containing efalizumab, made by means of biotechnology. It is produced by \ngenetically engineered mammalian cells. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies \nare proteins that recognise and bind to other specific proteins of the human body. Efalizumab reduces \ninflammation of the psoriatic lesions which results in improvement of the affected areas of the skin.  \n \nTherapeutic indications \nTreatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who have failed to \nrespond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including \nciclosporin, methotrexate and PUVA.  \nThis restriction of the indication of Raptiva is based on the present efficacy data and limited long-term \nexperience with Raptiva.  \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE RAPTIVA \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDo not use Raptiva: \n- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to efalizumab or any of the other ingredients of Raptiva. \n- If you have or have had any cancer.  \n- If you have active tuberculosis or other severe infections. Symptoms that might indicate that \n\nyou have an infection are fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems, a bad cough that lasts \nlonger than 2 weeks, pain in the chest or coughing up blood or sputum. \n\n- If you have forms of psoriasis other than plaque psoriasis (for instance other more severe forms \nof psoriasis, as diagnosed by your doctor). \n\n- If you have been diagnosed as having a disorder of your immune system. \n \n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you have had or you have any of the above.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n25 \n\nTake special care with Raptiva: \n- If you experience hypersensitivity or allergic reactions such as overall body itching, hives, skin \n\nflushing or rash tell your doctor immediately or go to the local casualty. \n- You might get infections more easily. If you develop a new infection or notice any new or \n\nsudden change in thinking, balance, strength, talking, walking or vision, please contact your \ndoctor. He/she will determine whether to monitor your treatment or whether it is necessary for \nyou to stop using Raptiva.  \n\n- If you develop cancer while undergoing treatment, please contact your doctor who will \ndetermine if it is necessary for you to stop using Raptiva. \n\n- If you develop signs and symptoms associated with anaemia (a reduction in red blood cells \nwhich can make the skin pale and cause weakness or breathlessness) while undergoing \ntreatment, please contact your doctor who will determine if it is necessary for you to stop using \nRaptiva. \n\n- If you develop any of the signs and symptoms associated with a decrease in blood platelets, \nsuch as easy bleeding from the gums, bruising or pinpoint red spots on the skin, please tell your \ndoctor immediately. He/she will determine whether to monitor your treatment or whether it is \nnecessary for you to stop using Raptiva. \n\n- Some patients had reactions including headache, fever, nausea and vomiting within two days of \neach of the first two injections. These reactions were largely mild to moderate. If you notice that \nany of these reactions do not vanish after the second injection, tell your doctor. \n\n- If you discontinue Raptiva treatment (and this applies especially to patients not responding to \ntreatment) your psoriasis may significantly worsen. Your doctor may wish to monitor you and \nprovide effective treatment. \n\n- If you experience a worsening of your psoriasis or you develop arthritis, please inform your \ndoctor. He/she will determine whether to stop using Raptiva or continue treatment with closer \nobservation. \n\n- If you are going to receive any vaccine, please check with your doctor. You must not receive \ncertain types of vaccines during Raptiva treatment. It may be necessary to discontinue Raptiva \ntreatment 8 weeks before a vaccination. \n\n- If your weight changes unexpectedly, please contact your doctor. He/she will calculate the \ncorrect dosage based on your new weight. \n\n \nTell your doctor if you have renal or hepatic impairment. \n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \nPlease check with your doctor if you are planning to receive any vaccine (see \u201cTake special care with \nRaptiva\u201d).  \nWhen taking Raptiva you might be more vulnerable to infections (see Take special care with Raptiva) \nthis effect might be enhanced by other medicines that are used to treat psoriasis and that also make you \nmore vulnerable to infections. Please check with your doctor if you receive other medicines to treat \nyour psoriasis.  \nRaptiva can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids.  \n \nPregnancy \nIt is not known whether Raptiva can cause harm to your baby if you are pregnant or whether it can \naffect your ability to become pregnant. Therefore, if you are pregnant, consult with your doctor \nimmediately. \nIf you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised not to become pregnant and to use \nadequate contraception while using Raptiva. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is possible that efalizumab is excreted in human milk. If you are breastfeeding, your doctor will \nadvise you either to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue Raptiva while breastfeeding. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n26 \n\nDriving and using machines \nThe use of Raptiva is not expected to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE RAPTIVA \n \nAlways take Raptiva exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nDosing for adults (18-64 years) and the elderly (\u2265 65 years) \nThe usual dose is an initial single injection of 0.7 mg/kg followed by weekly injections of 1.0 mg/kg. \nYour doctor will tell you how much you should inject. The duration of therapy is 12 weeks. Therapy \nmay be continued only in patients who responded to treatment, your doctor will discuss with you the \nextent of your response to treatment. \n \nMethod and route of administration \nRaptiva is injected just under the skin (subcutaneous). It is for single use only. The injection can be \nself-administered or given by another person, for example a family member or your doctor. You \nshould continue to inject Raptiva as long as instructed to do so by your doctor. \n \nThe vial of powder is designed to be reconstituted (mixed) with the solvent. \n \nIf you administer Raptiva, please read the following instructions carefully and follow then step by \nstep: \n\u2022 Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and items you use be as clean as possible. \n\u2022 Take the Raptiva out of the refrigerator and lay out on a clean surface everything you need: \n\no one vial containing the Raptiva powder \no one pre-filled syringe containing the solvent \no one EasyMIX adapter for reconstitution \no two alcohol swabs \no one needle for subcutaneous injection, and \no a sharps container \n \n\n\u2022 Remove the protective cap from the Raptiva vial and from the solvent pre-filled syringe. Wipe \nthe top of the vial with an alcohol swab.  \n\n\u2022 Holding the EasyMIX outer cover, carefully peel back and remove the protective film using the \ntab. This will expose a plastic spiked end that you will use to pierce the vial. You should not \ntouch this area. \n\n\u2022 Holding the EasyMIX outer cover, place it on top of the vial, then press down so that the plastic \nspiked end pierces the rubber stopper on the vial. \n\n\u2022 Ensure the EasyMIX adapter is firmly attached to the vial, before removing the outer cover.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n27 \n\n\u2022 Pull off the cap covering the pre-filled syringe tip.  \n\u2022 Attach the pre-filled syringe containing the solvent to the EasyMIX adapter with a \u2018push and \n\ntwist\u2019 action. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 Very slowly push down on the syringe plunger to inject all the solvent into the Raptiva vial. \n\u2022 Without removing the syringe, gently rotate the vial to dissolve the medicine in the solvent.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDo not shake (Shaking will cause foaming of the Raptiva solution). Generally reconstitution takes less \nthan 5 minutes. After the powder has dissolved, check the resulting solution for particles and \ndiscoloration. The reconstituted solution should be clear to pale yellow and free of particles. No other \nmedicines should be added to the solution containing Raptiva and Raptiva should not be reconstituted \nwith other solvents. \n\u2022 Turn the vial upside down, with the syringe still attached. Withdraw the solution slowly into the \n\nsyringe, taking more than the dose you need. Some foam or bubbles may remain in the vial. \n With the syringe still attached to the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles.  \n\u2022 Gently tap the syringe to make any bubbles rise to the top of the syringe.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 Gently push the plunger up until the dose to be given remains in the syringe.

Sites for self-injection include the buttocks, thigh, abdomen or upper arm. \nThe injection sites should be rotated.  \n\u2022 Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. Remove the shield from the injection needle. \n\u2022 Immediately inject the solution as follows: Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle \n\nat a 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 angle using a dart-like motion. Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not \ninject directly into a vein. Pull back the plunger very slightly. If blood comes into the syringe, \nthe needle has entered a blood vessel. Do not inject but withdraw the needle and repeat the \ninjection procedure. Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger. Take as much time as \nyou need to inject all the solution. Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an \nalcohol swab using a circular motion. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Dispose of all used items: Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all \nneedles and empty glass containers in a sharps container. Any unused solution must be \ndiscarded. \n\n \nIf you use more Raptiva than you should \nIf you have injected more Raptiva than told by your doctor, please contact your doctor or pharmacist. \nIt is recommended that you are monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and that you \nare given appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Raptiva \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nPlease contact your doctor if you forget to take 2 or more doses of Raptiva. \n \nIf you stop using Raptiva \nIf you discontinue treatment with Raptiva without substitution treatment, your psoriasis may \nsignificantly worsen. (See \u201cTake special care with Raptiva\u201d) \n \nIn case re-treatment with Raptiva is needed you should follow the guidance of your doctor. Re-\ntreatment may be associated with lower or inadequate response to Raptiva than in the earlier treatment \nperiods. Therapy should be continued only when adequate response is observed.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Raptiva can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe side effects in this section are given with an estimation of the frequency with which they may \noccur. For this purpose the following classification has been used: \n\u2022 Very common: Side effects that may occur in more than 1 out of 10 patients; \n\u2022 Common: Side effects that may occur in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients; \n\u2022 Uncommon: Side effects that may occur in 1 to 10 out of 1,000 patients; \n\u2022 Rare: Side effects that may occur in 1 to 10 out of 10,000 patients; \n\u2022 Very rare: Side effects that may occur in less than 1 out of 10,000 patients; \n \nRaptiva may cause mild to moderate flu-like symptoms including headache, chills, nausea, muscle \naches and occasionally fever within 48 hours of an injection of Raptiva. These symptoms are very \ncommon and occur most often after the first two doses and decrease with continued use. If any of these \nsymptoms are severe or persist, you should contact your doctor. In clinical trials, visible side effects at \nthe injection site and injection site pain were uncommon. \n \nTell your doctor or go to the local casualty and stop using Raptiva immediately if you:  \n\u2022 Notice serious hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. Symptoms of an \n\nallergic reaction are common and generally include overall body itching, hives, skin flushing or \nrash. Anaphylaxis is a more serious allergic reaction that may involve dizziness, vomiting, low \nblood pressure, and difficulty with breathing. Prompt medical care is needed since serious \nallergic reactions may be potentially life-threatening. \n\n\u2022 Notice symptoms of low blood platelet counts, such as easy bleeding from the gums, bruising or \npinpoint red spots on the skin. These symptoms are uncommon.  \n\n\u2022 Notice signs of nerve disorder such as tingling or onset of weakness in legs or arms or new or \nsudden change in thinking, balance, strength, talking, walking or vision. \n\n\u2022 Notice severe headache accompanied with nuchal rigidity. This may occur rarely in particular at \nthe beginning of the treatment. \n\n\u2022 Are diagnosed with cancer.  \n\u2022 Develop a diffuse skin rash or blisters in your oral cavity. \n \nTell your doctor and discuss with him your general health if you notice any of the following: \n\u2022 Back pain, joints pain, headache, vomiting, weakness, fatigue or rash. These common side \n\neffects have not been clearly associated with Raptiva but have been observed when using it. \nYour doctor may want to examine you more closely and ask you to have blood tests. \n\n\u2022 Fever or if you think that you have an infection. Raptiva acts on the immune system, which may \npotentially increase your risk of infectious diseases or may reactivate old infections. Infections \nare very common.  \n\n\u2022 A relapse or flare or strong worsening of psoriasis or red, inflamed psoriatic plaques, sometimes \nwith swelling of your arms or legs or joint inflammation, especially after stopping Raptiva. \nThese side effects are common. \n\n\u2022 Shortness of breath or any persistent respiratory difficulties. \n\u2022 Signs of facial paralysis usually on one side of the face (such as weakness of face muscles and \n\ndribbling) possibly preceded by pain in the ear area. Generally patients with facial paralysis \nrecover within a few weeks without any specific treatment. \n\n \nCertain laboratory tests may change, such as the number of white or red blood cells (including \nleukocytes and lymphocytes) as well as alkaline phosphatase and ALT values (blood laboratory \nvalues). These changes, which may be associated with the use of Raptiva, can usually only be detected \nwith blood tests. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n30 \n\n \n5.

with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. dosing for adults (18-64 years) and the elderly (\u2265 65 years) the usual dose is an initial single injection of 0.7 mg/kg followed by weekly injections of 1.0 mg/kg. your doctor will tell you how much you should inject. the duration of therapy is 12 weeks. therapy may be continued only in patients who responded to treatment, your doctor will discuss with you the extent of your response to treatment. method and route of administration raptiva is injected just under the skin (subcutaneous). it is for single use only. the injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for example a family member or your doctor. you should continue to inject raptiva as long as instructed to do so by your doctor. the vial of powder is designed to be reconstituted (mixed) with the solvent. if you administer raptiva, please read the following instructions carefully and follow then step by step: wash your hands. it is important that your hands and items you use be as clean as possible. take the raptiva out of the refrigerator and lay out on a clean surface everything you need: o one vial containing the raptiva powder o one pre-filled syringe containing the solvent o one easymix adapter for reconstitution o two alcohol swabs o one needle for subcutaneous injection, and o a sharps container remove the protective cap from the raptiva vial and from the solvent pre-filled syringe. wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. holding the easymix outer cover, carefully peel back and remove the protective film using the tab. this will expose a plastic spiked end that you will use to pierce the vial. you should not touch this area. holding the easymix outer cover, place it on top of the vial, then press down so that the plastic spiked end pierces the rubber stopper on the vial. ensure the easymix adapter is firmly attached to the vial, before removing the outer cover. pull off the cap covering the pre-filled syringe tip. attach the pre-filled syringe containing the solvent to the easymix adapter with a 'push and twist' action. very slowly push down on the syringe plunger to inject all the solvent into the raptiva vial. without removing the syringe, gently rotate the vial to dissolve the medicine in the solvent. do not shake (shaking will cause foaming of the raptiva solution). generally reconstitution takes less than 5 minutes. after the powder has dissolved, check the resulting solution for particles and discoloration. the reconstituted solution should be clear to pale yellow and free of particles. no other medicines should be added to the solution containing raptiva and raptiva should not be reconstituted with other solvents. turn the vial upside down, with the syringe still attached. withdraw the solution slowly into the syringe, taking more than the dose you need. some foam or bubbles may remain in the vial. with the syringe still attached to the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. gently tap the syringe to make any bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. gently push the plunger up until the dose to be given remains in the syringe. this will also push the bubbles out of the syringe and into the vial. if you eject too much raptiva back into the vial, simply repeat the drawing up process and continue. check you have the right dose, then remove the syringe from the easymix adapter using a 'twist and pull' action. you are now ready to attach the injection needle. take the injection needle and, with its shield still in place, carefully screw it on to the syringe tip. you are now ready to select and prepare your injection site. your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject. sites for self-injection include the buttocks, thigh, abdomen or upper arm. the injection sites should be rotated. wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. remove the shield from the injection needle. immediately inject the solution as follows: firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 angle using a dart-like motion. inject under the skin, as you were taught. do not inject directly into a vein. pull back the plunger very slightly. if blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. do not inject but withdraw the needle and repeat the injection procedure. inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger. take as much time as you need to inject all the solution. immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion. dispose of all used items: once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in a sharps container. any unused solution must be discarded. if you use more raptiva than you should if you have injected more raptiva than told by your doctor, please contact your doctor or pharmacist. it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and that you are given appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately. if you forget to use raptiva do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. please contact your doctor if you forget to take 2 or more doses of raptiva. if you stop using raptiva if you discontinue treatment with raptiva without substitution treatment, your psoriasis may significantly worsen. (see \"take special care with raptiva\") in case re-treatment with raptiva is needed you should follow the guidance of your doctor. re- treatment may be associated with lower or inadequate response to raptiva than in the earlier treatment periods. therapy should be continued only when adequate response is observed. your doctor will advise you what to do when insufficient response to treatment or worsening of your disease is observed. (see also under take special care with raptiva) if you have any further questions on the use of the product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "raptiva", "Type":
