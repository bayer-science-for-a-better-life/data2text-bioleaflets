This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVITRAKVI 25 mg hard capsules \nVITRAKVI 100 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nVITRAKVI 25 mg hard capsules \nEach hard capsule contains larotrectinib sulfate equivalent to 25 mg of larotrectinib. \n \nVITRAKVI 100 mg hard capsules \nEach hard capsule contains larotrectinib sulfate equivalent to 100 mg of larotrectinib. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nVITRAKVI 25 mg hard capsules \nWhite opaque hard gelatine capsule, size 2 (18 mm long x 6 mm wide), with blue printing of \nBAYER-cross and “LARO 25 mg” on body of capsule. \n \nVITRAKVI 100 mg hard capsules \nWhite opaque hard gelatine capsule, size 0 (22 mm long x 7 mm wide), with blue printing of \nBAYER-cross and “LARO 100 mg” on body of capsule. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid \ntumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, \n- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to \n\nresult in severe morbidity, and \n- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with VITRAKVI should be initiated by physicians experienced in the administration of \nanticancer therapies. \n \nThe presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by a validated test \nprior to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose in adults is 100 mg larotrectinib twice daily, until disease progression or until \nunacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nPaediatric population \nDosing in paediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose in \npaediatric patients is 100 mg/m2 larotrectinib twice daily with a maximum of 100 mg per dose until \ndisease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed \ndose. Patients should take the next dose at the next scheduled time. If the patient vomits after taking a \ndose, the patient should not take an additional dose to make up for vomiting. \n \nDose modification \nFor all Grade 2 adverse reactions, continued dosing may be appropriate, though close monitoring to \nensure no worsening of the toxicity is advised. Patients with Grade 2 ALT and/or AST increases, \nshould be followed with serial laboratory evaluations every one to two weeks after the observation of \nGrade 2 toxicity until resolved to establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is required. \n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions: \n- VITRAKVI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or \n\nGrade 1. Resume at the next dose modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks. \n- VITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued if an adverse reaction does not resolve within \n\n4 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions \n\nDose modification \nAdult and \n\npaediatric patients with body \nsurface area of at least 1.0 m2 \n\nPaediatric patients with body \nsurface area less than 1.0 m2 \n\nFirst 75 mg twice daily 75 mg/m2 twice daily \n\nSecond 50 mg twice daily 50 mg/m2 twice daily \n\nThird 100 mg once daily 25 mg/m2 twice daily \n\n \nVITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued in patients who are unable to tolerate VITRAKVI \nafter three dose modifications. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe starting dose of VITRAKVI should be reduced by 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) \nto severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with \nmild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nCo-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIf co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the VITRAKVI dose should be \nreduced by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, \nVITRAKVI should be resumed at the dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nVITRAKVI is for oral use. \n \nVITRAKVI is available as a capsule or oral solution with equivalent oral bioavailability and may be \nused interchangeably. \n \nThe patient should be advised to swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water. Due to the bitter \ntaste, the capsule should not be opened, chewed or crushed. \n \nThe capsules can be taken with or without food but should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit \njuice. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy across tumour types \n \nThe benefit of VITRAKVI has been established in single arm trials encompassing a relatively small \nsample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of VITRAKVI have \nbeen shown on the basis of overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour \ntypes. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant \ngenetic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, VITRAKVI should only be used if there are no \ntreatment options for which clinical benefit has been established, or where such treatment options have \nbeen exhausted (i.e., no satisfactory treatment options). \n \nNeurologic reactions \n \nNeurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients \nreceiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred \nwithin the first three months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing VITRAKVI dosing \nshould be considered, depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see section 4.2). \n \nTransaminase elevations \n \nALT and AST increase were reported in patients receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). The majority \nof ALT and AST increases occurred in the first 3 months of treatment. \nLiver function including ALT and AST assessments should be monitored before the first dose and \nmonthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then periodically during treatment, with more frequent \ntesting in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Withhold or permanently discontinue \nVITRAKVI based on the severity. If withheld, the VITRAKVI dose should be modified when \nresumed (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCo-administration with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers \n \nAvoid co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers with VITRAKVI due to a risk \nof decreased exposure (see section 4.5). \n \nContraception in female and male \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking VITRAKVI \nand for at least one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \nMales of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of child bearing potential should \nbe advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one \nmonth after the final dose (see section 4.6). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other agents on larotrectinib \n \nEffect of CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on larotrectinib \nLarotrectinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong CYP3A inhibitors, P-gp and \nBCRP inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, \nnelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole or grapefruit) may \nincrease larotrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.2). \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI \ndose with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 200 mg once daily \nfor 7 days increased larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 2.8-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively. \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI \ndose with a single dose of 600 mg rifampin (a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) increased larotrectinib Cmax \nand AUC by 1.8-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively. \n \nEffect of CYP3A and P-gp inducers on larotrectinib \nCo-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A and P-gp inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, or St. John’s Wort) may decrease \nlarotrectinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see section 4.4). \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI \ndose with rifampin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg twice daily for 11 days decreased \nlarotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 71% and 81%, respectively. No clinical data is available on the effect \nof a moderate inducer, but a decrease in larotrectinib exposure is expected. \n \nEffects of larotrectinib on other agents \n \nEffect of larotrectinib on CYP3A substrates \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of VITRAKVI (100 mg twice \ndaily for 10 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam 1.7-fold compared to midazolam \nalone, suggesting that larotrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. \nExercise caution with concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. \nalfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or \ntacrolimus) in patients taking VITRAKVI. If concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow \ntherapeutic range is required in patients taking VITRAKVI, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates \nmay be required due to adverse reactions. \n \nEffect of larotrectinib on CYP2B6 substrates \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib induces CYP2B6. Co-administration of larotrectinib with \nCYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nEffect of larotrectinib on other transporter substrates \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. No clinical studies have been \nperformed to investigate interactions with OATP1B1 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded \nwhether co-administration of larotrectinib with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. valsartan, statins) may \nincrease their exposure. \n \nEffect of larotrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is a weak inducer of PXR regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C \nfamily and UGT). Co-administration of larotrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates \n(e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure. \n \nHormonal contraceptives \nIt is currently unknown whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting \nhormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should \nbe advised to add a barrier method. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n \nBased on the mechanism of action, foetal harm cannot be excluded when administering larotrectinib to \na pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting \ntreatment with VITRAKVI. \nWomen of reproductive potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception during \ntreatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one month after the final dose. As it is currently unknown \nwhether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives, \nwomen using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method. \nMales of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of child-bearing potential should \nbe advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one \nmonth after the final dose. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of larotrectinib in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VITRAKVI during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether larotrectinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with VITRAKVI and for 3 days following the \nfinal dose. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effect of larotrectinib on fertility. No relevant effects on fertility were \nobserved in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines \n \nVITRAKVI has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue \nhave been reported in patients receiving larotrectinib, mostly Grade 1 and 2 during the first 3 months \nof treatment. This may influence the ability to drive and use machines during this time period. Patients \nshould be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain VITRAKVI therapy \ndoes not affect them adversely (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe safety of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 125 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer in one of \nthree clinical trials, Studies 1, 2 (“NAVIGATE”), and 3 (“SCOUT”). Median time on treatment for the \noverall safety population was 7.4 months (range: 0.03 to 40.7). The safety population characteristics \nwere comprised of patients with a median age of 45 years (range: 0.1, 80) with 30% of patients being \npaediatric patients. The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of VITRAKVI in order of \ndecreasing frequency were fatigue (32%), increased ALT (31%), dizziness (30%), increased AST \n(29%), constipation (29%), nausea (26%), anaemia (24%), and vomiting (20%). \nThe majority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 4 was the highest reported grade for \nadverse reactions neutrophil count decreased (1.6%) and ALT increased (< 1%). The highest reported \ngrade was Grade 3 for adverse reactions anaemia, weight increased, fatigue, increased AST, dizziness, \nparaesthesia, nausea, myalgia, and leukocyte count decreased. All the reported Grade 3 adverse \nreactions occurred in less than 5% of patients, with the exception of anaemia (7%). \nPermanent discontinuation of VITRAKVI for treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of \nattribution occurred in 3% of patients (one case each of ALT increase, AST increase, intestinal \nperforation, jaundice, small intestinal obstruction). The majority of adverse reactions leading to dose \nreduction occurred in the first three months of treatment. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe adverse drug reactions reported in patients treated with VITRAKVI are shown in Table 2 and \nTable 3. \n \nThe adverse drug reactions are classified according to the System Organ Class. \nFrequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), \nand not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \nWithin each frequency group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2: Adverse drug reactions reported in TRK fusion-positive cancer patients treated with \nVITRAKVI at recommended dose (n=125) \n\nSystem organ class Frequency All grades Grades 3 and 4 \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nVery common Anaemia \nNeutrophil count decreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count decreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\n \n\nCommon  Anaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased (Neutropenia)a \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased (Leukopenia) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Dizziness \nParaesthesia \n\n \n\nCommon Gait disturbance \n \n\nDizziness \nParaesthesia \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVery common Nausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\n \n\nCommon Dysgeusia Nausea \nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nMuscular weakness \n\n \n\nCommon  Myalgia \nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common Fatigue  \n\nCommon  Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Very common Alanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal weight gain) \n\n \n\nCommon Blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased \n\nAlanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) increaseda \nAspartate \naminotransferase (AST) \nincreased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal weight gain) \n\na Grade 4 reactions were reported \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 3: Adverse drug reactions reported in TRK fusion-positive paediatric cancer patients \ntreated with VITRAKVI at recommended dose (n=37); all Grades \nSystem organ \nclass \n\nFrequency Infants and \ntoddlers \n(n=14)a \n\nChildren \n \n(n=15)b \n\nAdolescents \n \n(n=8)c \n\nPaediatric \npatients \n(n=37) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nAnaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nAnaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nAnaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\n  Dizziness \nParaesthesia \n\n \n\nCommon  Paraesthesia \nGait disturbance \n\n Dizziness \nParaesthesia \nGait disturbance \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nNausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\nNausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\nNausea \nVomiting \n\nNausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\nCommon  Dysgeusia  Dysgeusia \nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\n  Myalgia \nMuscular \nweakness \n\n \n\nCommon  Myalgia  Myalgia \nMuscular \nweakness \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nFatigue Fatigue  Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Very \ncommon \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal \nweight gain) \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal \nweight gain) \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal \nweight gain) \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\nCommon Blood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\n   \n\na Infant/toddlers (28 days to 23 months): one Grade 4 Neutrophil count decreased (Neutropenia) reaction reported.

The overall incidence was 30% for dizziness, 10% for paraesthesia and 3% for \ngait disturbance. Neurologic reactions leading to dose modification included dizziness (2%). None of \nthese adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation. In all cases, patients with evidence of \nanti-tumour activity who required a dose reduction were able to continue dosing at a reduced dose \nand/or schedule (see section 4.4). \n \nTransaminase elevations \nIn the overall safety database (n=125), the maximum grade transaminase elevation observed was \nGrade 4 ALT increase in 1 patient (<1%). Grade 3 ALT and AST increases in 3 (2%) and 2 (2%) \npatients, respectively. Majority of Grade 3 elevations were transient appearing in first or second month \nof treatment and resolving to Grade 1 by months 3-4. Grade 2 ALT and AST increases were observed \nin 9 (7%) and 6 (5%) of patients, respectively, and Grade 1 ALT and AST increases were observed in \n26 (21%) and 28 (22%) of patients, respectively. \nALT and AST increases leading to dose modifications occurred in 7 (6%) patients and 6 (5%) patients, \nrespectively (see section 4.4). No patient permanently discontinued the treatment due to Grade 3-4 \nALT and AST increases. \n \nAdditional information on special populations  \n \nPaediatric patients \nOf 125 patients treated with VITRAKVI, 37 (30%) patients were from 28 days to 18 years of age. Of \nthese 37 patients, 38% were 28 days to < 2 years (n=14), 41% were 2 years to < 12 years (n=15), and \n22% were 12 years to < 18 years (n=8). The safety profile in the paediatric population (< 18 years) \nwas consistent in types of reported adverse reactions to those observed in the adult population. The \nmajority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity (see Table 3) and were resolved without \nVITRAKVI dose modification or discontinuation. The adverse reactions of vomiting (35% versus \n14% in adults), leucocyte count decrease (22% versus 9% in adults), neutrophil count decrease (30% \nversus 7% in adults), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (14% versus 2% in adults) and \ntransaminase elevations (ALT 41% versus 27% in adults and AST 35% versus 26% in adults) were \nmore frequent in paediatric patients compared to adults. \n \nElderly \nOf 125 patients in the overall safety population who received VITRAKVI, 28 (22%) patients were \n65 years or older and 8 (6%) patients were 75 years or older. The safety profile in elderly patients \n(≥ 65 years) is consistent with that seen in younger patients (< 65 years). The adverse reactions gait \ndisturbance (17% versus 3% in under 65 years), and blood alkaline phosphatase increased (4% versus \n2% in under 65 years) were more frequent in patients of 65 years or older. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with VITRAKVI. Symptoms of overdose are not established. \nIn the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat \nsymptomatically. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, \nprotein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE53. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLarotrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and selective tropomyosin receptor \nkinase (TRK) inhibitor that was rationally designed to avoid activity with off-target kinases. The target \nfor larotrectinib is the TRK family of proteins inclusive of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that are encoded \nby NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, \nlarotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5-11 nM. The only other \nkinase activity occurred at 100-fold higher concentrations. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, \nlarotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins \nresulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein \noverexpression. \n \nIn-frame gene fusion events resulting from chromosomal rearrangements of the human genes NTRK1, \nNTRK2, and NTRK3 lead to the formation of oncogenic TRK fusion proteins. These resultant novel \nchimeric oncogenic proteins are aberrantly expressed, driving constitutive kinase activity subsequently \nactivating downstream cell signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival leading to \nTRK fusion-positive cancer. \n \nAcquired resistance mutations after progression on TRK inhibitors have been observed. Larotrectinib \nhad minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the \nclinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain \nwith clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L. \n \nThe molecular causes for primary resistance to larotrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if \nthe presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy \nof TRK inhibition. The measured impact of any concomitant genomic alterations on larotrectinib \nefficacy is provided below (see clinical efficacy). \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nIn 36 healthy adult subjects receiving single doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg, VITRAKVI did \nnot prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. \nThe 200 mg dose corresponds to a peak exposure (Cmax) similar to that observed with larotrectinib \n100 mg BID at steady state. A shortening of QTcF was observed with VITRAKVI dosing, with a \nmaximum mean effect observed between 3 and 24 hours after Cmax, with a geometric mean decrease in \nQTcF from baseline of -13.2 msec (range -10 to -15.6 msec). Clinical relevance of this finding has not \nbeen established.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nOverview of studies \nThe efficacy and safety of VITRAKVI were studied in three multicentre, open-label, single-arm \nclinical studies in adult and paediatric cancer patients (Table 4). The studies were ongoing at the time \nof approval. \nPatients with and without documented NTRK gene fusion were allowed to participate in Study 1 and \nStudy 3 (“SCOUT”). Patients enrolled to Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) were required to have TRK \nfusion-positive cancer. The pooled primary analysis set of efficacy includes 93 patients with TRK \nfusion-positive cancer enrolled across the three studies that had measurable disease assessed by \nRECIST v1.1, a non-CNS primary tumour and received at least one dose of larotrectinib. These \n\n\n\n12 \n\npatients were required to have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumour type and \nstage of disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would have had to undergo radical surgery \n(such as limb amputation, facial resection, or paralysis causing procedure), or were unlikely to \ntolerate, or derive clinically meaningful benefit from available standard of care therapies in the \nadvanced disease setting. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and \nduration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). \nIn addition, 9 patients with primary CNS tumours and measurable disease at baseline were treated in \nStudy 2 (“NAVIGATE”) and in Study 3 (“SCOUT”). All primary CNS tumour patients had received \nprior cancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or previous systemic therapy). Tumour responses \nwere assessed by the investigator using RANO or RECIST v1.1 criteria. \n \nIdentification of NTRK gene fusions relied upon the molecular test methods: next generation \nsequencing (NGS) used in 98 patients, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used \nin 1 patient and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) used in 6 patients as routinely performed at \ncertified laboratories. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 4: Clinical studies contributing to the efficacy analyses in solid and primary CNS tumours \nStudy name, design and patient \npopulation \n\nDose and \nformulation \n\nTumour types included in \nefficacy analysis \n\nn \n\nStudy 1 \nNCT02122913 \n \n• Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation \n\nand expansion study; expansion \nphase required tumours with an \nNTRK gene fusion \n\n• Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with \nadvanced solid tumours with an \nNTRK gene fusion \n\nDoses up to 200 mg \nonce or twice daily \n(25 mg, 100 mg \ncapsules or 20 mg/mL \noral solution) \n\nSalivary gland (n=3) \nGIST (n=2)a \nNSCLC (n=1)c \nSoft tissue sarcoma (n=1) \nThyroid (n=1) \n\n8 \n\nStudy 2 “NAVIGATE” \nNCT02576431 \n \n• Phase 2 multinational, open label, \n\ntumour “basket” study \n• Adult and paediatric patients \n\n≥ 12 years with advanced solid \ntumours with an NTRK gene fusion \n\n100 mg twice daily \n(25 mg, 100 mg \ncapsules or 20 mg/mL \noral solution) \n\nSalivary gland (n=14) \nThyroid (n=9)b \nSoft tissue sarcoma (n=9) \nColorectal (n=6) \nMelanoma (n=6) \nNSCLC (n=5)b, c \nPrimary CNS (n=4) \nGIST (n=2)a \nBiliary (n=2) \nSCLC (n=1)b, d \nAppendix (n=1) \nBreast (n=1) \nBone sarcoma (n=1) \nPancreas (n=1) \n\n62 \n\nStudy 3 “SCOUT” \nNCT02637687 \n \n• Phase 1/2 multinational, open-label, \n\ndose escalation and expansion study; \nPhase 2 expansion cohort required \nadvanced solid tumours with an \nNTRK gene fusion, including locally \nadvanced infantile fibrosarcoma \n\n• Paediatric patients ≥ 1 month to \n21 years with advanced cancer or \nwith primary CNS tumours \n\nDoses up to \n100 mg/m2 twice daily \n(25 mg, 100 mg \ncapsules or 20 mg/mL \noral solution) \n\nInfantile fibrosarcoma \n(n=13) \nSoft tissue sarcoma (n=11) \nPrimary CNS (n=5) \nBone sarcoma (n=1) \nCongenital mesoblastic \nnephroma (n=1) \nMelanoma (n=1) \n\n32 \n\nTotal number of patients (n)* 102 \n*  consist of 93 patients with IRC tumour response assessment and 9 patients with primary CNS tumours (including glioma, \n\nglioblastoma and astrocytoma) with investigator tumour response assessment \na GIST: gastrointestinal stromal tumour \nb brain metastases observed in one thyroid, one NSCLC, and one SCLC patient \nc NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer \nd SCLC: small cell lung cancer \n \nBaseline characteristics for the pooled 93 patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion were \nas follows: median age 41 years (range 0.1-78 years); 30% < 18 years of age, and 70% ≥ 18 years; \n70% white and 53% male; and ECOG PS 0-1 (89%), or 2 (11%).

The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific \ntumour type. \n \nIn the adult sub-population (n=65), the ORR was 68%. In the paediatric sub-population (n=28), the \nORR was 82%. \n \nIn 85 patients with wide molecular characterisation before larotrectinib treatment, the ORR in \n48 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 58%, and in \n37 patients without other genomic alterations ORR was 84%. \n \nPooled primary analysis set \n \nThe pooled primary analysis set consisted of 93 patients and did not include primary CNS tumours. \nMedian time on treatment was 12.1 months (range: 0.66 to 40.7 months) based on July 2018 cut-off. \nFifty-two percent of patients had received VITRAKVI for 12 months or more and 30% had received \nVITRAKVI 18 months or more, with follow-up ongoing at the time of the analysis. \nAt the time of analysis, the median duration of response had not been reached, 75% patients had \nresponses which were ongoing with an estimated 88% of responses lasting 6 months or longer and \n75% of responses lasting 12 months or longer. Eighty-eight percent (88%) [95% CI: 81, 95] of patients \n\n\n\n16 \n\ntreated were alive one year after the start of therapy. Median progression free survival had not been \nreached at the time of analysis. \nThe median change in tumour size in the pooled primary analysis set was a decrease of 66%. \n \nPatients with primary CNS tumours \n \nAt the time of data cut-off, 8 of 9 enrolled patients with primary CNS tumours were evaluable for \nresponse by investigator assessment. A partial response was observed in 1 patient. At the time of data \ncut-off, time on treatment ranged from 2.8 to 9.2 months and was ongoing in 6 out of 9 patients. \n \nConditional approval \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn cancer patients given VITRAKVI capsules, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of larotrectinib were achieved \nat approximately 1 hour after dosing. Half-life (t½) is approximately 3 hours and steady state is reached \nwithin 8 days with a systemic accumulation of 1.6 fold. At the recommended dose of 100 mg taken \ntwice daily, steady-state arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) Cmax and daily AUC in adults were \n914 ± 445 ng/mL and 5410 ± 3813 ng*h/mL, respectively. In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is \nnot a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of \nsubstrates of these CYPs. \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit the transporters BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, \nOCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations and is \nunlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these transporters. \n \nAbsorption \n \nVITRAKVI is available as a capsule and oral solution formulation. \nThe mean absolute bioavailability of larotrectinib was 34% (range: 32% to 37%) following a single \n100 mg oral dose. In healthy adult subjects, the AUC of larotrectinib in the oral solution formulation \nwas similar to the capsule, with Cmax 36% higher with the oral solution formulation. \nLarotrectinib Cmax was reduced by approximately 35% and there was no effect on AUC in healthy \nsubjects administered VITRAKVI after a high-fat and high-calorie meal compared to the Cmax and \nAUC after overnight fasting. \n \nEffect of gastric pH-elevating agents on larotrectinib \nLarotrectinib has pH-dependent solubility. In vitro studies show that in liquid volumes relevant to the \ngastrointestinal (GI) tract larotrectinib is fully soluble over entire pH range of the GI tract. Therefore, \nlarotrectinib is unlikely to be affected by pH-modifying agents. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean volume of distribution of larotrectinib in healthy adult subjects was 48 L following \nintravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose, indicating \nmoderate distribution into tissues from the plasma. Binding of larotrectinib to human plasma proteins \nin vitro was approximately 70% and was independent of drug concentration. The blood-to-plasma \nconcentration ratio was approximately 0.9. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nLarotrectinib was metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4/5 in vitro. Following oral administration of \na single 100 mg dose of radiolabeled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, unchanged larotrectinib \n(19%) and an O-glucuronide that is formed following loss of the hydroxypyrrolidine-urea moiety \n(26%) were the major circulating radioactive drug components. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life of larotrectinib in plasma of cancer patients given 100 mg twice daily of VITRAKVI was \napproximately 3 hours. Mean clearance (CL) of larotrectinib was approximately 34 L/h following \nintravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of \nVITRAKVI. \n \nExcretion \n \nFollowing oral administration of 100 mg radiolabeled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, 58% of \nthe administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 39% was recovered in urine and when an \nIV microtracer dose was given in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib, 35% of the \nadministered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 53% was recovered in urine. The fraction \nexcreted as unchanged drug in urine was 29% following IV microtracer dose, indicating that direct \nrenal excretion accounted for 29% of total clearance. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration \n(Cmax) of larotrectinib after a single dose in healthy adult subjects were dose proportional up to 400 mg \nand slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 to 900 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses exposure (Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients \n(1 month to <3 months of age) at the recommended dose of 100 mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg \nBID was 3-fold higher than in adults (≥18 years of age) given the dose of 100 mg BID. At the \nrecommended dose, the Cmax in paediatric patients (≥3 months to <12 years of age) was higher than in \nadults, but the AUC was similar to that in adults. For paediatric patients older than 12 years of age, the \nrecommended dose is likely to give similar Cmax and AUC as observed in adults. \nData defining exposure in small children (1 month to <6 years of age) at the recommended dose is \nlimited (n=33). \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data in elderly. PK data is available only in 2 patients over 65 years. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate \n(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and in healthy adult control subjects \nwith normal hepatic function matched for age, body mass index and sex. All subjects received a single \n100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib AUC0-inf was observed in subjects with mild, \nmoderate and severe hepatic impairment of 1.3, 2 and 3.2-fold respectively versus those with normal \nhepatic function. Cmax was observed to increase slightly by 1.1, 1.1 and 1.5-fold respectively. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, \nand in healthy adult control subjects with normal renal function matched for age, body mass index and \nsex. All subjects received a single 100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib Cmax and \nAUC0-inf, of 1.25 and 1.46-fold respectively was observed in renally impaired subjects versus those \nwith normal renal function. \n \nOther special populations \nGender did not appear to influence larotrectinib pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. \nThere was not enough data to investigate the potential influence of race on the systemic exposure of \nlarotrectinib. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic toxicity \n \nSystemic toxicity was assessed in studies with daily oral administration up to 3 months in rats and \nmonkeys. Dose limiting skin lesions were only seen in rats and were primarily responsible for \nmortality and morbidity. Skin lesions were not seen in monkeys. \nClinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity were dose limiting in monkeys. In rats, severe toxicity \n(STD10) was observed at doses corresponding to 1- to 2-times the human AUC at the recommended \nclinical dose. No relevant systemic toxicity was observed in monkeys at doses which correspond to \n> 10-times the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. \n \nEmbryotoxicity / Teratogenicity  \n \nLarotrectinib was not teratogenic and embryotoxic when dosed daily during the period of \norganogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at maternotoxic doses, i.e. corresponding to 32-times (rats) \nand 16-times (rabbits) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Larotrectinib crosses the \nplacenta in both species. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nFertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted. In 3-months toxicity studies, larotrectinib \nhad no histological effect on the male reproductive organs in rats and monkeys at the highest tested \ndoses corresponding to approximately 7-times (male rats) and 10-times (male monkeys) the human \nAUC at the recommended clinical dose. In addition, larotrectinib had no effect on spermatogenesis in \nrats. \n \nIn a 1-month repeat-dose study in rats, fewer corpora lutea, increased incidence of anestrus and \ndecreased uterine weight with uterine atrophy were observed and these effects were reversible. No \neffects on female reproductive organs were seen in the 3-months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys \nat doses corresponding to approximately 3-times (female rats) and 17-times (female monkeys) the \nhuman AUC at the recommended clinical dose. \nLarotrectinib was administered to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to 70. Pre-weaning \nmortality (before PND 21) was observed at the high dose level corresponding to 2.5- to 4-times the \nAUC at the recommended dose. Growth and nervous system effects were seen at 0.5- to 4-times the \nAUC at the recommended dose. Body weight gain was decreased in pre-weaning male and female \npups, with a post-weaning increase in females at the end of exposure whereas reduced body weight \ngain was seen in males also post-weaning without recovery. The male growth reduction was \nassociated with delayed puberty. Nervous system effects (i.e. altered hindlimb functionality and, \nlikely, increases in eyelid closure) demonstrated partial recovery. A decrease in pregnancy rate was \nalso reported despite normal mating at the high-dose level. \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with larotrectinib. \nLarotrectinib was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays and in in vitro \nmammalian mutagenesis assays. Larotrectinib was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at \nthe maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg. \n \nSafety pharmacology \n \nThe safety pharmacology of larotrectinib was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies that \nassessed effects on the CV, CNS, respiratory, and GI systems in various species. Larotrectinib had no \nadverse effect on haemodynamic parameters and ECG intervals in telemetered monkeys at exposures \n(Cmax) which are approximately 6-fold the human therapeutic exposures. Larotrectinib had no \nneurobehavioural findings in adult animals (rats, mice, cynomolgus monkeys) at exposure (Cmax) at \nleast 7-fold higher than the human exposure. Larotrectinib had no effect on respiratory function in rats; \nat exposures (Cmax) at least 8-times the human therapeutic exposure. In rats, larotrectinib accelerated \nintestinal transit and increased gastric secretion and acidity. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of oral solution contains larotrectinib sulfate equivalent to 20 mg of larotrectinib. \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nEach mL of oral solution contains 295 mg sucrose, 22 mg sorbitol, 1.6 mg propylene glycol and \n0.2 mg methyl parahydroxybenzoate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution. \n \nClear yellow to orange solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid \ntumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, \n- who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to \n\nresult in severe morbidity, and \n- who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with VITRAKVI should be initiated by physicians experienced in the administration of \nanticancer therapies. \n \nThe presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by a validated test \nprior to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose in adults is 100 mg larotrectinib twice daily, until disease progression or until \nunacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \nPaediatric population \nDosing in paediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose in \npaediatric patients is 100 mg/m2 larotrectinib twice daily with a maximum of 100 mg per dose until \ndisease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, the patient should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed \ndose. Patients should take the next dose at the next scheduled time. If the patient vomits after taking a \ndose, the patient should not take an additional dose to make up for vomiting. \n \nDose modification \nFor all Grade 2 adverse reactions, continued dosing may be appropriate, though close monitoring to \nensure no worsening of the toxicity is advised. Patients with Grade 2 ALT and/or AST increases, \nshould be followed with serial laboratory evaluations every one to two weeks after the observation of \nGrade 2 toxicity until resolved to establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is required. \n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions: \n- VITRAKVI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or \n\nGrade 1. Resume at the next dose modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks. \n- VITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued if an adverse reaction does not resolve within \n\n4 weeks. \n \nThe recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions \n\nDose modification \nAdult and \n\npaediatric patients with body \nsurface area of at least 1.0 m2 \n\nPaediatric patients with body \nsurface area less than 1.0 m2 \n\nFirst 75 mg twice daily 75 mg/m2 twice daily \n\nSecond 50 mg twice daily 50 mg/m2 twice daily \n\nThird 100 mg once daily 25 mg/m2 twice daily \n\n \nVITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued in patients who are unable to tolerate VITRAKVI \nafter three dose modifications. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe starting dose of VITRAKVI should be reduced by 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) \nto severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with \nmild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nCo-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \nIf co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the VITRAKVI dose should be \nreduced by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, \nVITRAKVI should be resumed at the dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nVITRAKVI is for oral use. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nVITRAKVI is available as a capsule or oral solution with equivalent oral bioavailability and may be \nused interchangeably. \n \nThe oral solution should be administered by mouth using an oral syringe of 1 mL or 5 mL volume or \nenterally by using a nasogastric feeding tube. \n- For doses below 1 mL a 1 mL oral syringe should be used. The calculated dose volume should \n\nbe rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL. \n- For doses of 1 mL and higher a 5 mL oral syringe should be used. The dose volume should be \n\ncalculated to the nearest 0.2 mL. \n- VITRAKVI should not be mixed with feeding formulas, if administered via nasogastric feeding \n\ntube. Mixing with the feeding formulas could lead to tube blockages. \n- For instructions for use of oral syringes and feeding tubes see section 6.6. \n \nThe oral solution can be taken with or without food but should not be taken with grapefruit or \ngrapefruit juice. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEfficacy across tumour types \n \nThe benefit of VITRAKVI has been established in single arm trials encompassing a relatively small \nsample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of VITRAKVI have \nbeen shown on the basis of overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour \ntypes. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant \ngenetic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, VITRAKVI should only be used if there are no \ntreatment options for which clinical benefit has been established, or where such treatment options have \nbeen exhausted (i.e., no satisfactory treatment options). \n \nNeurologic reactions \n \nNeurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients \nreceiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred \nwithin the first three months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing VITRAKVI dosing \nshould be considered, depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see section 4.2). \n \nTransaminase elevations \n \nALT and AST increase were reported in patients receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). The majority \nof ALT and AST increases occurred in the first 3 months of treatment. \nLiver function including ALT and AST assessments should be monitored before the first dose and \nmonthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then periodically during treatment, with more frequent \ntesting in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Withhold or permanently discontinue \nVITRAKVI based on the severity. If withheld, the VITRAKVI dose should be modified when \nresumed (see section 4.2). \n \nCo-administration with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers \n \nAvoid co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers with VITRAKVI due to a risk \nof decreased exposure (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nContraception in female and male \n \nWomen of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking VITRAKVI \nand for at least one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  \nMales of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of child bearing potential should \nbe advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one \nmonth after the final dose (see section 4.6). \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients \n \nSucrose: may be harmful to the teeth. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, \nglucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \nSorbitol: patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. \nSodium: this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 mL, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \nPropylene glycol: co-administration with any substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase such as ethanol may \ninduce serious adverse effects in neonates. \nParahydroxybenzoate: may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other agents on larotrectinib \n \nEffect of CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on larotrectinib \nLarotrectinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer \nresistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong CYP3A inhibitors, P-gp and \nBCRP inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, \nnelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole or grapefruit) may \nincrease larotrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.2). \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI \ndose with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 200 mg once daily \nfor 7 days increased larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 2.8-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively. \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI \ndose with a single dose of 600 mg rifampin (a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) increased larotrectinib Cmax \nand AUC by 1.8-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively. \n \nEffect of CYP3A and P-gp inducers on larotrectinib \nCo-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A and P-gp inducers (e.g. \ncarbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, or St. John’s Wort) may decrease \nlarotrectinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see section 4.4). \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI \ndose with rifampin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg twice daily for 11 days decreased \nlarotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 71% and 81%, respectively. No clinical data is available on the effect \nof a moderate inducer, but a decrease in larotrectinib exposure is expected. \n \nEffects of larotrectinib on other agents \n \nEffect of larotrectinib on CYP3A substrates \nClinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of VITRAKVI (100 mg twice \ndaily for 10 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam 1.7-fold compared to midazolam \nalone, suggesting that larotrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. \nExercise caution with concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. \nalfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or \ntacrolimus) in patients taking VITRAKVI. If concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow \ntherapeutic range is required in patients taking VITRAKVI, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates \nmay be required due to adverse reactions. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nEffect of larotrectinib on CYP2B6 substrates \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib induces CYP2B6. Co-administration of larotrectinib with \nCYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure. \n \nEffect of larotrectinib on other transporter substrates \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. No clinical studies have been \nperformed to investigate interactions with OATP1B1 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded \nwhether co-administration of larotrectinib with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. valsartan, statins) may \nincrease their exposure. \n \nEffect of larotrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is a weak inducer of PXR regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C \nfamily and UGT). Co-administration of larotrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates \n(e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure. \n \nHormonal contraceptives \nIt is currently unknown whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting \nhormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should \nbe advised to add a barrier method. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \n \nBased on the mechanism of action, foetal harm cannot be excluded when administering larotrectinib to \na pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting \ntreatment with VITRAKVI. \nWomen of reproductive potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception during \ntreatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one month after the final dose. As it is currently unknown \nwhether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives, \nwomen using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method. \nMales of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of child-bearing potential should \nbe advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one \nmonth after the final dose. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of larotrectinib in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VITRAKVI during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether larotrectinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nBreast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with VITRAKVI and for 3 days following the \nfinal dose. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effect of larotrectinib on fertility. No relevant effects on fertility were \nobserved in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines \n \nVITRAKVI has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue \nhave been reported in patients receiving larotrectinib, mostly Grade 1 and 2 during the first 3 months \nof treatment. This may influence the ability to drive and use machines during this time period. Patients \nshould be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain VITRAKVI therapy \ndoes not affect them adversely (see section 4.4). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe safety of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 125 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer in one of \nthree clinical trials, Studies 1, 2 (“NAVIGATE”), and 3 (“SCOUT”). Median time on treatment for the \noverall safety population was 7.4 months (range: 0.03 to 40.7). The safety population characteristics \nwere comprised of patients with a median age of 45 years (range: 0.1, 80) with 30% of patients being \npaediatric patients. The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of VITRAKVI in order of \ndecreasing frequency were fatigue (32%), increased ALT (31%), dizziness (30%), increased AST \n(29%), constipation (29%), nausea (26%), anaemia (24%), and vomiting (20%). \nThe majority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 4 was the highest reported grade for \nadverse reactions neutrophil count decreased (1.6%) and ALT increased (< 1%). The highest reported \ngrade was Grade 3 for adverse reactions anaemia, weight increased, fatigue, increased AST, dizziness, \nparaesthesia, nausea, myalgia, and leukocyte count decreased. All the reported Grade 3 adverse \nreactions occurred in less than 5% of patients, with the exception of anaemia (7%). \nPermanent discontinuation of VITRAKVI for treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of \nattribution occurred in 3% of patients (one case each of ALT increase, AST increase, intestinal \nperforation, jaundice, small intestinal obstruction). The majority of adverse reactions leading to dose \nreduction occurred in the first three months of treatment. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe adverse drug reactions reported in patients treated with VITRAKVI are shown in Table 2 and \nTable 3. \n \nThe adverse drug reactions are classified according to the System Organ Class. \nFrequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 \nto < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), \nand not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \nWithin each frequency group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 2: Adverse drug reactions reported in TRK fusion-positive cancer patients treated with \nVITRAKVI at recommended dose (n=125) \n\nSystem organ class Frequency All grades Grades 3 and 4 \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nVery common Anaemia \nNeutrophil count decreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count decreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\n \n\nCommon  Anaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased (Neutropenia)a \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased (Leukopenia) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Dizziness \nParaesthesia \n\n \n\nCommon Gait disturbance \n \n\nDizziness \nParaesthesia \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVery common Nausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\n \n\nCommon Dysgeusia Nausea \nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nVery common Myalgia \nMuscular weakness \n\n \n\nCommon  Myalgia \nGeneral disorders \nand administration \nsite conditions \n\nVery common Fatigue  \n\nCommon  Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Very common Alanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal weight gain) \n\n \n\nCommon Blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased \n\nAlanine aminotransferase \n(ALT) increaseda \nAspartate \naminotransferase (AST) \nincreased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal weight gain) \n\na Grade 4 reactions were reported \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nTable 3: Adverse drug reactions reported in TRK fusion-positive paediatric cancer patients \ntreated with VITRAKVI at recommended dose (n=37); all Grades \nSystem organ \nclass \n\nFrequency Infants and \ntoddlers \n(n=14)a \n\nChildren \n \n(n=15)b \n\nAdolescents \n \n(n=8)c \n\nPaediatric \npatients \n(n=37) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nAnaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nAnaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nAnaemia \nNeutrophil count \ndecreased \n(Neutropenia) \nLeukocyte count \ndecreased \n(Leukopenia) \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\n  Dizziness \nParaesthesia \n\n \n\nCommon  Paraesthesia \nGait disturbance \n\n Dizziness \nParaesthesia \nGait disturbance \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nNausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\nNausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\nNausea \nVomiting \n\nNausea \nConstipation \nVomiting \n\nCommon  Dysgeusia  Dysgeusia \nMusculoskeletal \nand connective \ntissue disorders \n\nVery \ncommon \n\n  Myalgia \nMuscular \nweakness \n\n \n\nCommon  Myalgia  Myalgia \nMuscular \nweakness \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nFatigue Fatigue  Fatigue \n\nInvestigations Very \ncommon \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal \nweight gain) \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal \nweight gain) \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\nAlanine \naminotransferase \n(ALT) increased \nAspartate \naminotransferase \n(AST) increased \nWeight increased \n(Abnormal \nweight gain) \nBlood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\nCommon Blood alkaline \nphosphatase \nincreased \n\n   \n\na Infant/toddlers (28 days to 23 months): one Grade 4 Neutrophil count decreased (Neutropenia) reaction reported.

The overall incidence was 30% for dizziness, 10% for paraesthesia and 3% for \ngait disturbance. Neurologic reactions leading to dose modification included dizziness (2%). None of \nthese adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation. In all cases, patients with evidence of \nanti-tumour activity who required a dose reduction were able to continue dosing at a reduced dose \nand/or schedule (see section 4.4). \n \nTransaminase elevations \nIn the overall safety database (n=125), the maximum grade transaminase elevation observed was \nGrade 4 ALT increase in 1 patient (<1%). Grade 3 ALT and AST increases in 3 (2%) and 2 (2%) \npatients, respectively. Majority of Grade 3 elevations were transient appearing in first or second month \nof treatment and resolving to Grade 1 by months 3-4. Grade 2 ALT and AST increases were observed \nin 9 (7%) and 6 (5%) of patients, respectively, and Grade 1 ALT and AST increases were observed in \n26 (21%) and 28 (22%) of patients, respectively. \nALT and AST increases leading to dose modifications occurred in 7 (6%) patients and 6 (5%) patients, \nrespectively (see section 4.4). No patient permanently discontinued the treatment due to Grade 3-4 \nALT and AST increases. \n \nAdditional information on special populations  \n \nPaediatric patients \nOf 125 patients treated with VITRAKVI, 37 (30%) patients were from 28 days to 18 years of age. Of \nthese 37 patients, 38% were 28 days to < 2 years (n=14), 41% were 2 years to < 12 years (n=15), and \n22% were 12 years to < 18 years (n=8). The safety profile in the paediatric population (< 18 years) \nwas consistent in types of reported adverse reactions to those observed in the adult population. The \nmajority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity (see Table 3) and were resolved without \nVITRAKVI dose modification or discontinuation. The adverse reactions of vomiting (35% versus \n14% in adults), leucocyte count decrease (22% versus 9% in adults), neutrophil count decrease (30% \nversus 7% in adults), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (14% versus 2% in adults) and \ntransaminase elevations (ALT 41% versus 27% in adults and AST 35% versus 26% in adults) were \nmore frequent in paediatric patients compared to adults. \n \nElderly  \nOf 125 patients in the overall safety population who received VITRAKVI, 28 (22%) patients were \n65 years or older and 8 (6%) patients were 75 years or older. The safety profile in elderly patients \n(≥ 65 years) is consistent with that seen in younger patients (< 65 years). The adverse reactions gait \ndisturbance (17% versus 3% in under 65 years), and blood alkaline phosphatase increased (4% versus \n2% in under 65 years) were more frequent in patients of 65 years or older. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is limited experience of overdose with VITRAKVI. Symptoms of overdose are not established. \nIn the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat \nsymptomatically. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, \nprotein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01XE53. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nLarotrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and selective tropomyosin receptor \nkinase (TRK) inhibitor that was rationally designed to avoid activity with off-target kinases. The target \nfor larotrectinib is the TRK family of proteins inclusive of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that are encoded \nby NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, \nlarotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5-11 nM. The only other \nkinase activity occurred at 100-fold higher concentrations. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, \nlarotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins \nresulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein \noverexpression. \n \nIn-frame gene fusion events resulting from chromosomal rearrangements of the human genes NTRK1, \nNTRK2, and NTRK3 lead to the formation of oncogenic TRK fusion proteins. These resultant novel \nchimeric oncogenic proteins are aberrantly expressed, driving constitutive kinase activity subsequently \nactivating downstream cell signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival leading to \nTRK fusion-positive cancer. \n \nAcquired resistance mutations after progression on TRK inhibitors have been observed. Larotrectinib \nhad minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the \nclinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain \nwith clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L. \n \nThe molecular causes for primary resistance to larotrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if \nthe presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy \nof TRK inhibition. The measured impact of any concomitant genomic alterations on larotrectinib is \nefficacy provided below (see clinical efficacy). \n \nPharmacodynamic effect \n \nCardiac electrophysiology \nIn 36 healthy adult subjects receiving single doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg, VITRAKVI did \nnot prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. \nThe 200 mg dose corresponds to a peak exposure (Cmax) similar to that observed with larotrectinib \n100 mg BID at steady state. A shortening of QTcF was observed with VITRAKVI dosing, with a \nmaximum mean effect observed between 3 and 24 hours after Cmax, with a geometric mean decrease in \nQTcF from baseline of -13.2 msec (range -10 to -15.6 msec). Clinical relevance of this finding has not \nbeen established.  \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nOverview of studies \nThe efficacy and safety of VITRAKVI were studied in three multicentre, open-label, single-arm \nclinical studies in adult and paediatric cancer patients (Table 4). The studies were ongoing at the time \nof approval. \nPatients with and without documented NTRK gene fusion were allowed to participate in Study 1 and \nStudy 3 (“SCOUT”). Patients enrolled to Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) were required to have TRK \nfusion-positive cancer. The pooled primary analysis set of efficacy includes 93 patients with TRK \nfusion-positive cancer enrolled across the three studies that had measurable disease assessed by \nRECIST v1.1, a non-CNS primary tumour and received at least one dose of larotrectinib. These \n\n\n\n31 \n\npatients were required to have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumour type and \nstage of disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would have had to undergo radical surgery \n(such as limb amputation, facial resection, or paralysis causing procedure), or were unlikely to \ntolerate, or derive clinically meaningful benefit from available standard of care therapies in the \nadvanced disease setting. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and \nduration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). \nIn addition, 9 patients with primary CNS tumours and measurable disease at baseline were treated in \nStudy 2 (“NAVIGATE”) and in Study 3 (“SCOUT”). All primary CNS tumour patients had received \nprior cancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or previous systemic therapy). Tumour responses \nwere assessed by the investigator using RANO or RECIST v1.1 criteria. \n \nIdentification of NTRK gene fusions relied upon the molecular test methods: next generation \nsequencing (NGS) used in 98 patients, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used \nin 1 patient and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) used in 6 patients as routinely performed at \ncertified laboratories. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTable 4: Clinical studies contributing to the efficacy analyses in solid and primary CNS tumours \nStudy name, design and patient \npopulation \n\nDose and \nformulation \n\nTumour types included in \nefficacy analysis \n\nn \n\nStudy 1 \nNCT02122913 \n \n• Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation \n\nand expansion study; expansion \nphase required tumours with an \nNTRK gene fusion \n\n• Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with \nadvanced solid tumours with an \nNTRK gene fusion \n\nDoses up to 200 mg \nonce or twice daily \n(25 mg, 100 mg \ncapsules or 20 mg/mL \noral solution) \n\nSalivary gland (n=3) \nGIST (n=2)a \nNSCLC (n=1)c \nSoft tissue sarcoma (n=1) \nThyroid (n=1) \n\n8 \n\nStudy 2 “NAVIGATE” \nNCT02576431 \n \n• Phase 2 multinational, open label, \n\ntumour “basket” study \n• Adult and paediatric patients \n\n≥ 12 years with advanced solid \ntumours with an NTRK gene fusion \n\n100 mg twice daily \n(25 mg, 100 mg \ncapsules or 20 mg/mL \noral solution) \n\nSalivary gland (n=14) \nThyroid (n=9)b \nSoft tissue sarcoma (n=9) \nColorectal (n=6) \nMelanoma (n=6) \nNSCLC (n=5)b, c \nPrimary CNS (n=4) \nGIST (n=2)a \nBiliary (n=2) \nSCLC (n=1)b, d \nAppendix (n=1) \nBreast (n=1) \nBone sarcoma (n=1) \nPancreas (n=1) \n\n62 \n\nStudy 3 “SCOUT” \nNCT02637687 \n \n• Phase 1/2 multinational, open-label, \n\ndose escalation and expansion study; \nPhase 2 expansion cohort required \nadvanced solid tumours with an \nNTRK gene fusion, including locally \nadvanced infantile fibrosarcoma \n\n• Paediatric patients ≥ 1 month to \n21 years with advanced cancer or \nwith primary CNS tumours \n\nDoses up to \n100 mg/m2 twice daily \n(25 mg, 100 mg \ncapsules or 20 mg/mL \noral solution) \n\nInfantile fibrosarcoma \n(n=13) \nSoft tissue sarcoma (n=11) \nPrimary CNS (n=5) \nBone sarcoma (n=1) \nCongenital mesoblastic \nnephroma (n=1) \nMelanoma (n=1) \n\n32 \n\nTotal number of patients (n)* 102 \n* consist of 93 patients with IRC tumour response assessment and 9 patients with primary CNS tumours (including glioma, \n\nglioblastoma and astrocytoma) with investigator tumour response assessment \na GIST: gastrointestinal stromal tumour \nb brain metastases observed in one thyroid, one NSCLC, and one SCLC patient \nc NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer \nd SCLC: small cell lung cancer \n \nBaseline characteristics for the pooled 93 patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion were \nas follows: median age 41 years (range 0.1-78 years); 30% < 18 years of age, and 70% ≥ 18 years; \n70% white and 53% male; and ECOG PS 0-1 (89%), or 2 (11%).

The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific \ntumour type. \n \nIn the adult sub-population (n=65), the ORR was 68%. In the paediatric sub-population (n=28), the \nORR was 82%. \n \nIn 85 patients with wide molecular characterisation before larotrectinib treatment, the ORR in \n48 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 58%, and in \n37 patients without other genomic alterations ORR was 84%. \n \nPooled primary analysis set \n \nThe pooled primary analysis set consisted of 93 patients and did not include primary CNS tumours. \nMedian time on treatment was 12.1 months (range: 0.66 to 40.7 months) based on July 2018 cut-off. \nFifty-two percent of patients had received VITRAKVI for 12 months or more and 30% had received \nVITRAKVI 18 months or more, with follow-up ongoing at the time of the analysis. \nAt the time of analysis, the median duration of response had not been reached, 75% patients had \nresponses which were ongoing with an estimated 88% of responses lasting 6 months or longer and \n75% of responses lasting 12 months or longer. Eighty-eight percent (88%) [95% CI: 81, 95] of patients \n\n\n\n35 \n\ntreated were alive one year after the start of therapy. Median progression free survival had not been \nreached at the time of analysis. \nThe median change in tumour size in the pooled primary analysis set was a decrease of 66%. \n \nPatients with primary CNS tumours \n \nAt the time of data cut-off, 8 of 9 enrolled patients with primary CNS tumours were evaluable for \nresponse by investigator assessment. A partial response was observed in 1 patient. At the time of data \ncut-off, time on treatment ranged from 2.8 to 9.2 months and was ongoing in 6 out of 9 patients. \n \nConditional approval \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nIn cancer patients given VITRAKVI capsules, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of larotrectinib were achieved \nat approximately 1 hour after dosing. Half-life (t½) is approximately 3 hours and steady state is reached \nwithin 8 days with a systemic accumulation of 1.6 fold. At the recommended dose of 100 mg taken \ntwice daily, steady-state arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) Cmax and daily AUC in adults were \n914 ± 445 ng/mL and 5410 ± 3813 ng*h/mL, respectively. In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is \nnot a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. \n \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, \nCYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of \nsubstrates of these CYPs. \nIn vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit the transporters BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, \nOCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations and is \nunlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these transporters. \n \nAbsorption \n \nVITRAKVI is available as a capsule and oral solution formulation. \nThe mean absolute bioavailability of larotrectinib was 34% (range: 32% to 37%) following a single \n100 mg oral dose. In healthy adult subjects, the AUC of larotrectinib in the oral solution formulation \nwas similar to the capsule, with Cmax 36% higher with the oral solution formulation. \nLarotrectinib Cmax was reduced by approximately 35% and there was no effect on AUC in healthy \nsubjects administered VITRAKVI after a high-fat and high-calorie meal compared to the Cmax and \nAUC after overnight fasting. \n \nEffect of gastric pH-elevating agents on larotrectinib \nLarotrectinib has pH-dependent solubility. In vitro studies show that in liquid volumes relevant to the \ngastrointestinal (GI) tract larotrectinib is fully soluble over entire pH range of the GI tract. Therefore, \nlarotrectinib is unlikely to be affected by pH-modifying agents. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe mean volume of distribution of larotrectinib in healthy adult subjects was 48 L following \nintravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose, indicating \nmoderate distribution into tissues from the plasma. Binding of larotrectinib to human plasma proteins \nin vitro was approximately 70% and was independent of drug concentration. The blood-to-plasma \nconcentration ratio was approximately 0.9. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nLarotrectinib was metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4/5 in vitro. Following oral administration of \na single 100 mg dose of radiolabeled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, unchanged larotrectinib \n(19%) and an O-glucuronide that is formed following loss of the hydroxypyrrolidine-urea moiety \n(26%) were the major circulating radioactive drug components. \n \nElimination \n \nThe half-life of larotrectinib in plasma of cancer patients given 100 mg twice daily of VITRAKVI was \napproximately 3 hours. Mean clearance (CL) of larotrectinib was approximately 34 L/h following \nintravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of \nVITRAKVI. \n \nExcretion \n \nFollowing oral administration of 100 mg radiolabeled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, 58% of \nthe administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 39% was recovered in urine and when an \nIV microtracer dose was given in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib, 35% of the \nadministered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 53% was recovered in urine. The fraction \nexcreted as unchanged drug in urine was 29% following IV microtracer dose, indicating that direct \nrenal excretion accounted for 29% of total clearance. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration \n(Cmax) of larotrectinib after a single dose in healthy adult subjects were dose proportional up to 400 mg \nand slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 to 900 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analyses exposure (Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients \n(1 month to <3 months of age) at the recommended dose of 100 mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg \nBID was 3-fold higher than in adults (≥18 years of age) given the dose of 100 mg BID. At the \nrecommended dose, the Cmax in paediatric patients (≥3 months to <12 years of age) was higher than in \nadults, but the AUC was similar to that in adults. For paediatric patients older than 12 years of age, the \nrecommended dose is likely to give similar Cmax and AUC as observed in adults. \nData defining exposure in small children (1 month to <6 years of age) at the recommended dose is \nlimited (n=33). \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data in elderly. PK data is available only in 2 patients over 65 years. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate \n(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and in healthy adult control subjects \nwith normal hepatic function matched for age, body mass index and sex. All subjects received a single \n100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib AUC0-inf was observed in subjects with mild, \nmoderate and severe hepatic impairment of 1.3, 2 and 3.2-fold respectively versus those with normal \nhepatic function. Cmax was observed to increase slightly by 1.1, 1.1 and 1.5-fold respectively. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPatients with renal impairment \nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, \nand in healthy adult control subjects with normal renal function matched for age, body mass index and \nsex. All subjects received a single 100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib Cmax and \nAUC0-inf, of 1.25 and 1.46-fold respectively was observed in renally impaired subjects versus those \nwith normal renal function. \n \nOther special populations \nGender did not appear to influence larotrectinib pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. \nThere was not enough data to investigate the potential influence of race on the systemic exposure of \nlarotrectinib. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSystemic toxicity \n \nSystemic toxicity was assessed in studies with daily oral administration up to 3 months in rats and \nmonkeys. Dose limiting skin lesions were only seen in rats and were primarily responsible for \nmortality and morbidity. Skin lesions were not seen in monkeys. \nClinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity were dose limiting in monkeys. In rats, severe toxicity \n(STD10) was observed at doses corresponding to 1- to 2-times the human AUC at the recommended \nclinical dose. No relevant systemic toxicity was observed in monkeys at doses which correspond to \n> 10-times the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. \n \nEmbryotoxicity / Teratogenicity  \n \nLarotrectinib was not teratogenic and embryotoxic when dosed daily during the period of \norganogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at maternotoxic doses, i.e. corresponding to 32-times (rats) \nand 16-times (rabbits) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Larotrectinib crosses the \nplacenta in both species. \n \nReproduction toxicity \n \nFertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted. In 3-months toxicity studies, larotrectinib \nhad no histological effect on the male reproductive organs in rats and monkeys at the highest tested \ndoses corresponding to approximately 7-times (male rats) and 10-times (male monkeys) the human \nAUC at the recommended clinical dose. In addition, larotrectinib had no effect on spermatogenesis in \nrats. \n \nIn a 1-month repeat-dose study in rats, fewer corpora lutea, increased incidence of anestrus and \ndecreased uterine weight with uterine atrophy were observed and these effects were reversible. No \neffects on female reproductive organs were seen in the 3-months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys \nat doses corresponding to approximately 3-times (female rats) and 17-times (female monkeys) the \nhuman AUC at the recommended clinical dose. \nLarotrectinib was administered to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to 70. Pre-weaning \nmortality (before PND 21) was observed at the high dose level corresponding to 2.5- to 4-times the \nAUC at the recommended dose. Growth and nervous system effects were seen at 0.5- to 4-times the \nAUC at the recommended dose. Body weight gain was decreased in pre-weaning male and female \npups, with a post-weaning increase in females at the end of exposure whereas reduced body weight \ngain was seen in males also post-weaning without recovery. The male growth reduction was \nassociated with delayed puberty. Nervous system effects (i.e. altered hindlimb functionality and, \nlikely, increases in eyelid closure) demonstrated partial recovery. A decrease in pregnancy rate was \nalso reported despite normal mating at the high-dose level. \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nGenotoxicity and carcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with larotrectinib. \nLarotrectinib was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays and in in vitro \nmammalian mutagenesis assays. Larotrectinib was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at \nthe maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg. \n \nSafety pharmacology \n \nThe safety pharmacology of larotrectinib was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies that \nassessed effects on the CV, CNS, respiratory, and GI systems in various species. Larotrectinib had no \nadverse effect on haemodynamic parameters and ECG intervals in telemetered monkeys at exposures \n(Cmax) which are approximately 6-fold the human therapeutic exposures. Larotrectinib had no \nneurobehavioural findings in adult animals (rats, mice, cynomolgus monkeys) at exposure (Cmax) at \nleast 7-fold higher than the human exposure. Larotrectinib had no effect on respiratory function in rats; \nat exposures (Cmax) at least 8-times the human therapeutic exposure. In rats, larotrectinib accelerated \nintestinal transit and increased gastric secretion and acidity. \n \n \n6.

What VITRAKVI is and what it is used for \n \nWhat VITRAKVI is used for \nVITRAKVI contains the active substance larotrectinib.  \n \nIt is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body \nthat are caused by a change in the NTRK gene (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase). \nVITRAKVI is only used when \n- these cancers are advanced or have spread to other parts of the body or if a surgery to remove \n\nthe cancer is likely to cause severe complications and \n- there are no satisfactory treatment options. \n \nBefore you are given VITRAKVI, your doctor will do a test to check if you have the change in the \nNTRK gene. \n \nHow VITRAKVI works \nIn patients whose cancer is due to an altered NTRK gene, the change in the gene causes the body to \nmake an abnormal protein called TRK fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and \ncancer. VITRAKVI blocks the action of TRK fusion proteins and so may slow or stop the growth of \nthe cancer. It may also help to shrink the cancer. \n \nIf you have any questions on how VITRAKVI works or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take VITRAKVI \n \nDo not take VITRAKVI if \n- you are allergic to larotrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nTests and checks \nVITRAKVI can increase the amount of the liver enzymes ALT and AST in your blood. Your doctor \nwill do blood tests before and during treatment to check the level of ALT and AST and check how \nwell your liver is working. \n \nOther medicines and VITRAKVI \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because some medicines may affect the way VITRAKVI works or VITRAKVI may \naffect how other medicines work.  \nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- medicines used to treat fungal or bacterial infections called itraconazole, voriconazole, \n\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin \n- a medicine used to treat Cushing’s syndrome called ketoconazole \n- medicines used to treat HIV infection called atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, \n\nsaquinavir, rifabutin, efavirenz \n- a medicine used to treat depression called nefazodone \n- medicines used to treat epilepsy called phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital \n- a herbal medicine used to treat depression called St. John’s wort \n- a medicine used to treat tuberculosis called rifampicin \n- a medicine used for strong pain relief called alfentanil \n- medicines used to prevent organ rejection after an organ transplant called ciclosporin, sirolimus, \n\ntacrolimus \n- a medicine used to treat an abnormal heart rhythm called quinidine \n- medicines used to treat migraines called dihydroergotamine, ergotamine \n- a medicine used to treat long-term pain called fentanyl \n- a medicine used to control involuntary movements or sounds called pimozide \n- a medicine to help you stop smoking called bupropion \n- medicines to reduce blood sugar levels called repaglinide, tolbutamide \n- a medicine that prevents blood clots called warfarin \n- a medicine used to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach called omeprazole \n- a medicine used to help control high blood pressure called valsartan \n- a group of medicines used to help lower cholesterol called statins \n- hormonal medicines used for contraception, see section “contraception – for men and women” \n\nbelow. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nTaking VITRAKVI with food and drink \nDo not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking VITRAKVI. This is because it may \nincrease the amount of VITRAKVI in your body. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nYou should not use VITRAKVI during pregnancy since the effect of VITRAKVI on the unborn is not \nknown. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 3 days after the last dose. This is because it is \nnot known if VITRAKVI passes into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nContraception – for men and women \nYou should avoid getting pregnant while taking this medicine. \nIf you are able to become pregnant, your doctor should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment. \nYou must use effective methods of contraception while taking VITRAKVI and for at least 1 month \nafter the last dose, if  \n- you are able to become pregnant.

What VITRAKVI is and what it is used for \n \nWhat VITRAKVI is used for \nVITRAKVI contains the active substance larotrectinib.  \n \nIt is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body \nthat are caused by a change in the NTRK gene (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase). \nVITRAKVI is only used when \n- these cancers are advanced or have spread to other parts of the body or if a surgery to remove \n\nthe cancer is likely to cause severe complications and \n- there are no satisfactory treatment options. \n \nBefore you are given VITRAKVI, your doctor will do a test to check if you have the change in the \nNTRK gene. \n \nHow VITRAKVI works \nIn patients whose cancer is due to an altered NTRK gene, the change in the gene causes the body to \nmake an abnormal protein called TRK fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and \ncancer. VITRAKVI blocks the action of TRK fusion proteins and so may slow or stop the growth of \nthe cancer. It may also help to shrink the cancer. \n \nIf you have any questions on how VITRAKVI works or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n\n\n\n67 \n\n2.

Your doctor \nwill do blood tests before and during treatment to check the level of ALT and AST and check how \nwell your liver is working. \n \nOther medicines and VITRAKVI \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This is because some medicines may affect the way VITRAKVI works or VITRAKVI may \naffect how other medicines work.  \nIn particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- medicines used to treat fungal or bacterial infections called itraconazole, voriconazole, \n\nclarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin \n- a medicine used to treat Cushing’s syndrome called ketoconazole \n- medicines used to treat HIV infection called atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, \n\nsaquinavir, rifabutin, efavirenz \n- a medicine used to treat depression called nefazodone \n- medicines used to treat epilepsy called phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital \n- a herbal medicine used to treat depression called St. John’s wort \n- a medicine used to treat tuberculosis called rifampicin \n- a medicine used for strong pain relief called alfentanil \n- medicines used to prevent organ rejection after an organ transplant called ciclosporin, sirolimus, \n\ntacrolimus \n- a medicine used to treat an abnormal heart rhythm called quinidine \n- medicines used to treat migraines called dihydroergotamine, ergotamine \n- a medicine used to treat long-term pain called fentanyl \n- a medicine used to control involuntary movements or sounds called pimozide \n- a medicine to help you stop smoking called bupropion \n- medicines to reduce blood sugar levels called repaglinide, tolbutamide \n- a medicine that prevents blood clots called warfarin \n- a medicine used to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach called omeprazole \n- a medicine used to help control high blood pressure called valsartan \n- a group of medicines used to help lower cholesterol called statins \n- hormonal medicines used for contraception, see section “contraception – for men and women” \n\nbelow. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nTaking VITRAKVI with food and drink \nDo not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking VITRAKVI. This is because it may \nincrease the amount of VITRAKVI in your body. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nYou should not use VITRAKVI during pregnancy since the effect of VITRAKVI on the unborn is not \nknown. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 3 days after the last dose. This is because it is \nnot known if VITRAKVI passes into breast milk. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nContraception – for men and women \nYou should avoid getting pregnant while taking this medicine. \nIf you are able to become pregnant, your doctor should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment. \nYou must use effective methods of contraception while taking VITRAKVI and for at least 1 month \nafter the last dose, if \n- you are able to become pregnant.
