NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNovoSeven 1 mg (50 KIU) powder and solvent for solution for injection \nNovoSeven 2 mg (100 KIU) powder and solvent for solution for injection \nNovoSeven 5 mg (250 KIU) powder and solvent for solution for injection \nNovoSeven 8 mg (400 KIU) powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nNovoSeven 1 mg (50 KIU)  \nNovoSeven is presented as powder and solvent for solution for injection containing 1 mg eptacog alfa \n(activated) per vial (corresponds to 50 KIU/vial). \n \nNovoSeven 2 mg (100 KIU) \nNovoSeven is presented as powder and solvent for solution for injection containing 2 mg eptacog alfa \n(activated) per vial (corresponds to 100 KIU/vial). \n \nNovoSeven 5 mg (250 KIU) \nNovoSeven is presented as powder and solvent for solution for injection containing 5 mg eptacog alfa \n(activated) per vial (corresponds to 250 KIU/vial). \n \nNovoSeven 8 mg (400 KIU) \nNovoSeven is presented as powder and solvent for solution for injection containing 8 mg eptacog alfa \n(activated) per vial (corresponds to 400 KIU/vial). \n \n1 KIU equals 1,000 IU (International Units). \n \nEptacog alfa (activated) is recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) with a molecular mass of \napproximately 50,000 Daltons produced in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK Cells) by recombinant \nDNA technology. \n \nAfter reconstitution, the product contains 1 mg/ml eptacog alfa (activated) when reconstituted with \nsolvent. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nWhite lyophilised powder. Solvent: clear colourless solution. The reconstituted solution has a pH of \napproximately 6.0. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in \nthose undergoing surgery or invasive procedures in the following patient groups: \n• in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or \n\nIX > 5 Bethesda Units (BU) \n• in patients with congenital haemophilia who are expected to have a high anamnestic response to \n\nfactor VIII or factor IX administration \n• in patients with acquired haemophilia \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n• in patients with congenital FVII deficiency \n• in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia with past or present refractoriness to platelet \n\ntransfusions, or where platelets are not readily available. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of \nhaemophilia and/or bleeding disorders. \n \nPosology \n \nHaemophilia A or B with inhibitors or expected to have a high anamnestic response \n \nDose \nNovoSeven should be given as early as possible after the start of a bleeding episode. The \nrecommended initial dose, administered by intravenous bolus injection, is 90 µg per kg body weight. \nFollowing the initial dose of NovoSeven further injections may be repeated. The duration of treatment \nand the interval between injections will vary with the severity of the haemorrhage, the invasive \nprocedures or surgery being performed. \n \nPaediatric population  \nCurrent clinical experience does not warrant a general differentiation in dosing between children and \nadults, although children have faster clearance than adults. Therefore, higher doses of rFVIIa may be \nneeded in paediatric patients to achieve similar plasma concentrations as in adult patients (see section \n5.2). \n \nDose interval \nInitially 2 – 3 hours to obtain haemostasis. \nIf continued therapy is needed, the dose interval can be increased successively once effective \nhaemostasis is achieved to every 4, 6, 8 or 12 hours for as long as treatment is judged as being \nindicated. \n \nMild to moderate bleeding episodes (including home therapy) \nEarly intervention has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate joint, muscle \nand mucocutaneous bleeds. Two dosing regimens can be recommended: \n \n1) Two to three injections of 90 µg per kg body weight administered at three-hour intervals. \n\nIf further treatment is required, one additional dose of 90 µg per kg body weight can be \nadministered. \n\n2) One single injection of 270 µg per kg body weight. \n \nThe duration of home therapy should not exceed 24 hours. Only after consultation with the \nhaemophilia treatment centre can continued home treatment be considered. \n \nThere is no clinical experience with administration of a single dose of 270 µg per kg body weight in \nelderly patients. \n \nSerious bleeding episodes \nAn initial dose of 90 µg per kg body weight is recommended and could be administered on the way to \nthe hospital where the patient is usually treated. The following dose varies according to the type and \nseverity of the haemorrhage. Dosing frequency should initially be every second hour until clinical \nimprovement is observed. If continued therapy is indicated, the dose interval can then be increased to \n3 hours for 1 – 2 days. Thereafter, the dose interval can be increased successively to every 4, 6, 8 or \n12 hours for as long as treatment is judged as being indicated. A major bleeding episode may be \ntreated for 2 – 3 weeks but can be extended beyond this if clinically warranted. \n \nInvasive procedure/surgery \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nAn initial dose of 90 µg per kg body weight should be given immediately before the intervention. The \ndose should be repeated after 2 hours and then at 2 – 3 hour intervals for the first 24 – 48 hours \ndepending on the intervention performed and the clinical status of the patient. In major surgery, the \ndose should be continued at 2 – 4 hour intervals for 6 – 7 days. The dose interval may then be \nincreased to 6 – 8 hours for another 2 weeks of treatment.  \nPatients undergoing major surgery may be treated for up to 2 – 3 weeks until healing has occurred. \n \nAcquired Haemophilia \n \nDose and dose interval \nNovoSeven should be given as early as possible after the start of a bleeding episode. The \nrecommended initial dose, administered by intravenous bolus injection, is 90 µg per kg body weight. \nFollowing the initial dose of NovoSeven further injections may be given if required. The duration of \ntreatment and the interval between injections will vary with the severity of the haemorrhage, the \ninvasive procedures or the surgery being performed. \nThe initial dose interval should be 2 – 3 hours. Once haemostasis has been achieved, the dose interval \ncan be increased successively to every 4, 6, 8 or 12 hours for as long as treatment is judged to be \nindicated. \n \nFactor VII deficiency \n \nDose, dose range and dose interval \nThe recommended dose range in adults and children for treatment of bleeding episodes and for the \nprevention of bleeding in patients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures is 15 – 30 μg per kg \nbody weight every 4 – 6 hours until haemostasis is achieved. Dose and frequency of injections should \nbe adapted to each individual. \n \nPaediatric population \nLimited clinical experience in long term prophylaxis has been gathered in the paediatric population \nbelow 12 years of age, with a severe clinical phenotype (see section 5.1). \n \nDose and frequency of injections for prophylaxis should be based on clinical response and adapted to \neach individual. \n \nGlanzmann’s thrombasthenia \n \nDose, dose range and dose interval \nThe recommended dose for treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in \npatients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures is 90 µg (range 80 – 120 µg) per kg body weight at \nintervals of two hours (1.5 – 2.5 hours). At least three doses should be administered to secure effective \nhaemostasis. The recommended route of administration is bolus injection as lack of efficacy may \nappear in connection with continuous infusion. \n \nFor those patients who are not refractory, platelets is the first line treatment for Glanzmann’s \nthrombasthenia. \n \nMethod of administration \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \nAdminister the solution as an intravenous bolus injection over 2 – 5 minutes. \n \nMonitoring of treatment – laboratory tests \n \nThere is no requirement for monitoring of NovoSeven therapy. Severity of bleeding condition and \nclinical response to NovoSeven administration must guide dosing requirements. \n \nAfter administration of rFVIIa, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT) have been shown to shorten, however no correlation has been demonstrated between PT and \n\n\n\n 5 \n\naPTT and clinical efficacy of rFVIIa. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse, \nhamster or bovine protein. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn pathological conditions in which tissue factor may be expressed more extensively than considered \nnormal, there may be a potential risk of development of thrombotic events or induction of \nDisseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) in association with NovoSeven treatment. \n \nSuch situations may include patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease, crush injury, septicaemia \nor DIC. Because of the risk of thromboembolic complications, caution should be exercised when \nadministering NovoSeven to patients with a history of coronary heart disease, to patients with liver \ndisease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thromboembolic phenomena \nor disseminated intravascular coagulation. In each of these situations, the potential benefit of treatment \nwith NovoSeven should be weighed against the risk of these complications. \n \nAs recombinant coagulation factor VIIa NovoSeven may contain trace amounts of mouse IgG, bovine \nIgG and other residual culture proteins (hamster and bovine serum proteins), the remote possibility \nexists that patients treated with the product may develop hypersensitivity to these proteins. In such \ncases treatment with antihistamines i.v. should be considered. \n \nIf allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration should be discontinued \nimmediately. In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. Patients \nshould be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions. If such symptoms occur, the \npatient should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. \n \nIn case of severe bleeds the product should be administered in hospitals preferably specialised in \ntreatment of haemophilia patients with coagulation factor VIII or IX inhibitors, or if not possible, in \nclose collaboration with a physician specialised in haemophilia treatment. \n \nIf bleeding is not kept under control hospital care is mandatory. Patients/carers should inform the \nphysician/supervising hospital at the earliest possible opportunity about all usages of NovoSeven. \n \nFactor VII deficient patients should be monitored for prothrombin time and factor VII coagulant \nactivity before and after administration of NovoSeven. In case the factor VIIa activity fails to reach the \nexpected level or bleeding is not controlled after treatment with the recommended doses, antibody \nformation may be suspected and analysis for antibodies should be performed. Thrombosis has been \nreported in FVII deficient patients receiving NovoSeven during surgery but the risk of thrombosis in \nfactor VII deficient patients treated with NovoSeven is unknown (see section 5.1). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nThe risk of a potential interaction between NovoSeven and coagulation factor concentrates is \nunknown. Simultaneous use of prothrombin complex concentrates, activated or not, should be \navoided. \n \nAnti-fibrinolytics have been reported to reduce blood loss in association with surgery in haemophilia \npatients, especially in orthopaedic surgery and surgery in regions rich in fibrinolytic activity, such as \nthe oral cavity. Experience with concomitant administration of anti-fibrinolytics and rFVIIa treatment \nis however limited. \n \nBased on a non-clinical study (see section 5.3) it is not recommended to combine rFVIIa and rFXIII. \nThere are no clinical data available on interaction between rFVIIa and rFXIII. \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nAs a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid use of NovoSeven during pregnancy. Data on a \nlimited number of exposed pregnancies within approved indications indicate no adverse effects of \nrFVIIa on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/new-born child. To date, no other relevant \nepidemiological data are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects \nwith respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether rFVIIa is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of rFVIIa in milk has \nnot been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to \ncontinue/discontinue therapy with NovoSeven should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NovoSeven therapy to the woman.  \n \nFertility \n \nData from non-clinical studies as well as post-marketing data show no indication that rFVIIa has a \nharmful effect on male or female fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse drug reactions are decreased therapeutic response, pyrexia, rash, \nvenous thromboembolic events, pruritus and urticaria. These reactions are reported as uncommon \n(≥ 1/1,000, < 1/100). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nTable 1 lists adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and from spontaneous (post-marketing) \nreports. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. Adverse drug reactions reported post-marketing only (i.e. not in clinical trials) are \npresented with a frequency of ‘not known’. \n \nClinical trials conducted in 484 patients (including 4297 treatment episodes) with haemophilia A and \nB, acquired haemophilia, factor VII deficiency or Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia have shown that \nadverse drug reactions are common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10). As the total number of treatment episodes in \nclinical trials is below 10,000, the lowest possible frequency of adverse drug reactions that can be \nassigned is rare (> 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nThe most frequent adverse drug reactions are pyrexia and rash (uncommon: > 1/1,000 to < 1/100), and \nthe most serious adverse drug reactions are thromboembolic events. \nThe frequencies of both serious and non-serious adverse drug reactions are listed by system organ \nclasses in the table below \n \nTable 1 Adverse reactions from clinical trials and spontaneous (post-marketing) reports \n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nMedDRA system \norgan class \n\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100) \n\nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) Frequency Not Known \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\n - Disseminated \nintravascular coagulation \n(see section 4.4) \n\n- Related laboratory \nfindings, including \nelevated levels of D-\ndimmer and decreased \nlevels of AT (see section \n4.4) \n\n- Coagulopathy \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n - Nausea  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\n- Therapeutic response \ndecreased* \n\n- Pyrexia \n\n- Injection site reaction \nincluding injection site \npain \n\n \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n - Hypersensitivity (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4) \n\n- Anaphylactic reaction \n\nInvestigations  - Increased fibrin \ndegradation products \n\n- Increase of alanine \naminotransferase, \nalkaline phosphatase, \nlactate dehydrogenase \nand prothrombin \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n - Headache  \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n- Rash (including \nallergic dermatitis and \nrash erythematous) \n\n- Pruritus and urticaria \n\n - Flushing \n\n- Angioedema \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n- Venous \nthromboembolic \nevents (deep vein \nthrombosis, \nthrombosis at i.v. site, \npulmonary embolism, \nthromboembolic \nevents of the liver \n\n- Arterial thromboembolic \nevents (myocardial \ninfarction, cerebral \ninfarction, cerebral \nischaemia, cerebral \nartery occlusion, \ncerebrovascular accident, \nrenal artery thrombosis, \n\n- Intracardiac thrombus \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nincluding portal vein \nthrombosis, renal vein \nthrombosis, \nthrombophlebitis, \nsuperficial \nthrombophlebitis and \nintestinal ischaemia) \n\nperipheral ischaemia, \nperipheral arterial \nthrombosis and intestinal \nischaemia) \n\n- Angina pectoris \n\n \n* Lack of efficacy (therapeutic response decreased) has been reported. It is important that the dosage \nregimen of NovoSevenis compliant with the recommended dosage as stated in section 4.2. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInhibitory antibody formation \n \nIn post-marketing experience, there have been no reports of inhibitory antibodies against NovoSeven \nor FVII in patients with haemophilia A or B. Development of inhibitory antibodies to NovoSeven has \nbeen reported in a post-marketing observational registry of patients with congenital FVII deficiency. \n \nIn clinical trials of patients with factor VII deficiency, formation of antibodies against NovoSeven and \nFVII is the only adverse drug reaction reported (frequency: common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)). In some \ncases, the antibodies showed inhibitory effect in vitro. Risk factors that may have contributed to \nantibody development including previous treatment with human plasma and/or plasma-derived factor \nVII, severe mutation of FVII gene, and overdose of NovoSeven, were present. Patients with factor VII \ndeficiency treated with NovoSeven should be monitored for factor VII antibodies (see section 4.4). \n \nThromboembolic events - arterial and venous \n \nWhen NovoSeven is administered to patients outside approved indications, arterial thromboembolic \nevents are common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10). A higher risk of arterial thromboembolic adverse events (see \ntable: Vascular disorders) (5.6% in patients treated with NovoSeven versus 3.0% in placebo-treated \npatients) has been shown in a meta-analysis of pooled data from placebo-controlled trials conducted \noutside current approved indications in various clinical settings, each of these having distinct patient \ncharacteristics and hence different underlying risk profiles.  \n \nSafety and efficacy of NovoSeven have not been established outside the approved indications and \ntherefore NovoSeven should not be used. \n \nThromboembolic events may lead to cardiac arrest. \n \nOther special populations \n \nPatients with acquired haemophilia \n \nClinical trials conducted in 61 patients with acquired haemophilia with a total of 100 treatment \nepisodes, showed that certain adverse drug reactions were reported more frequently (1% based on \ntreatment episodes): Arterial thromboembolic events (cerebral artery occlusion, cerebrovascular \naccident), venous thromboembolic events (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis), angina \npectoris, nausea, pyrexia, erythematous rash and investigation of increased levels of fibrin degradation \nproducts. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDose limiting toxicities of NovoSeven have not been investigated in clinical trials. \n \nFour cases of overdose have been reported in patients with haemophilia in 16 years. The only \ncomplication reported in connection with an overdose was a slight transient increase in blood pressure \nin a 16 year-old patient receiving 24 mg rFVIIa instead of 5.5 mg. \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported in patients with acquired haemophilia or Glanzmann’s \nthrombasthenia. \n \nIn patients with factor VII deficiency, where the recommended dose is 15 – 30 µg/kg rFVIIa, one \nepisode of overdose has been associated with a thrombotic event (occipital stroke) in an elderly \n(> 80 year) male patient treated with 10 – 20 times the recommended dose. In addition, the \ndevelopment of antibodies against NovoSeven and FVII has been associated with overdose in one \npatient with factor VII deficiency. \n \nThe dose schedule should not be intentionally increased above the recommended doses due to the \nabsence of information on the additional risk that may be incurred. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Blood coagulation factors, ATC code: B02BD08 \n \nMechanism of action \nNovoSeven contains activated recombinant coagulation factor VII. The mechanism of action includes \nthe binding of factor VIIa to exposed tissue factor. This complex activates factor IX into factor IXa \nand factor X into factor Xa, leading to the initial conversion of small amounts of prothrombin into \nthrombin. Thrombin leads to the activation of platelets and factors V and VIII at the site of injury and \nto the formation of the haemostatic plug by converting fibrinogen into fibrin. Pharmacological doses \nof NovoSeven activate factor X directly on the surface of activated platelets, localized to the site of \ninjury, independently of tissue factor. This results in the conversion of prothrombin into large amounts \nof thrombin independently of tissue factor.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nThe pharmacodynamic effect of factor VIIa gives rise to an increased local formation of factor Xa, \nthrombin and fibrin. \n \nA theoretical risk for the development of systemic activation of the coagulation system in patients \nsuffering from underlying diseases predisposing them to DIC cannot be totally excluded. \n \nIn an observational registry (F7HAEM-3578) covering subjects with congenital FVII deficiency, the \nmedian dose for long term prophylaxis against bleeding in 22 paediatric patients (below 12 years of \nage) with Factor VII deficiency and a severe clinical phenotype was 30 µg/kg (range 17 µg/kg to \n200 µg/kg; the dose most often used was 30 µg/kg in 10 patients) with a median dose frequency of 3 \ndoses per week (range 1 to 7; the dose frequency most often reported was 3 per week in 13 patients). \n \nIn the same registry 3 out of 91 surgical patients experienced thromboembolic events. \n \nAn observational registry (F7HAEM-3521) covered 133 subjects with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia \ntreated with NovoSeven. The median dose per infusion for treatment of 333 bleeding episodes was \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 10 \n\n90 µg/kg (range 28 to 450 µg/kg). NovoSeven was used in 157 surgical procedures, at a median dose \nof 92 µg/kg (up to 270 µg/kg). Treatment with NovoSeven, alone or in combination with \nantifibrinolytics and/or platelets, was defined as effective when bleeding was stopped for at least 6 \nhours. The efficacy rates were 81% and 82%, respectively, in patients with positive or negative \nrefractoriness to platelet transfusions, and 77% and 85%, respectively, in patients testing positive or \nnegative for antibodies to platelets. Positive status indicates at least one positive test at any admission. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nHealthy subjects \n \nDistribution, elimination and linearity \nUsing the FVII clotting assay, the pharmacokinetics of rFVIIa were investigated in 35 healthy \nCaucasian and Japanese subjects in a dose-escalation study. Subjects were stratified according to sex \nand ethnic group and dosed with 40, 80 and 160 µg rFVIIa per kg body weight (3 doses each) and/or \nplacebo. The pharmacokinetics were similar across sex and ethnic groups.  \nThe mean steady state volume of distribution ranged from 130 to 165 ml/kg, the mean values of \nclearance ranged from 33.3 to 37.2 ml/h×kg. \nThe mean terminal half-life ranged from 3.9 to 6.0 hours. \nThe pharmacokinetic profiles indicated dose proportionality. \n \nHaemophilia A and B with inhibitors \n \nDistribution, elimination and linearity \nUsing the FVIIa assay, the pharmacokinetic properties of rFVIIa were studied in 12 paediatric (2 – \n12 years) and 5 adult patients in non-bleeding state. \nMean volume of distribution at steady state was 196 ml/kg in paediatric patients versus 159 ml/kg in \nadults. \nMean clearance was approximately 50% higher in paediatric patients relative to adults (78 versus \n53 ml/h×kg), whereas the mean terminal half-life was determined to 2.3 hours in both groups. \nClearance appears related with age, therefore in younger patients clearance may be increased by more \nthan 50%. \nDose proportionality was established in children for the investigated doses of 90 and 180 µg per kg \nbody weight, which is in accordance with previous findings at lower doses (17.5 – 70 µg/kg rFVIIa).  \n \nFactor VII deficiency \n \nDistribution and elimination \nSingle dose pharmacokinetics of rFVIIa, 15 and 30 μg per kg body weight, showed no significant \ndifference between the two doses used with regard to dose-independent parameters:  \nVolume of distribution at steady state (280 – 290 ml/kg), half-life (2.82 – 3.11 h), total body clearance \n(70.8 – 79.1 ml/h×kg) and mean residence time (3.75 – 3.80 h).  \nThe mean in vivo plasma recovery was approximately 20%. \n \nGlanzmann’s thrombasthenia \n \nPharmacokinetics of NovoSeven in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia have not been \ninvestigated, but are expected to be similar to the pharmacokinetics in haemophilia A and B patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAll findings in the preclinical safety programme were related to the pharmacological effect of rFVIIa. \n \nA potential synergistic effect of combined treatment with rFXIII and rFVIIa in an advanced \ncardiovascular model in cynomolgus monkey resulted in exaggerated pharmacology (thrombosis and \ndeath) at a lower dose level than when administering the individual compounds. \n \n\n\n\n 11 \n\n \n6.

Not all presentations \nmay be marketed. Handling procedures for both presentations are described below. \n \nPowder in vial and solvent in vial: \n \nAlways use an aseptic technique. \n \nReconstitution \n \n• NovoSeven powder and solvent vials should be at room temperature at reconstitution. Remove \n\nthe plastic caps from the two vials. If the caps are loose or missing, do not use the vials. Clean \nthe rubber stoppers on the vials with alcohol swabs and allow them to dry before use. Use a \ndisposable syringe of an appropriate size and a vial adapter, transfer needle (20 – 26G) or other \nsuitable device. If devices other than those supplied by Novo Nordisk are used, ensure the use \nof an adequate filter with a pore size of 25 micrometer. \n\n \n• Attach the vial adapter to the solvent vial. If using a transfer needle, screw the transfer needle \n\ntightly onto the syringe. \n \n• Pull the plunger to draw in a volume of air that is equal to the amount of solvent in the solvent \n\nvial (ml equals cc on the syringe). \n \n• Screw the syringe tightly onto the vial adapter on the solvent vial. If using a transfer needle, \n\ninsert the transfer needle into the rubber stopper of the solvent vial. Inject air into the vial by \npushing the plunger until you feel a clear resistance. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n \n• Hold the syringe with the solvent vial upside down. If using a transfer needle, make sure the \n\ntransfer needle tip is in the solvent. Pull the plunger to draw the solvent into the syringe. \n \n• Remove the empty solvent vial. If using a vial adapter, tip the syringe to remove it from the vial. \n \n• Attach the syringe with the vial adapter or transfer needle to the powder vial. If using a transfer \n\nneedle, make sure to penetrate the centre of the rubber stopper. Hold the syringe slightly tilted \nwith the vial facing downwards. Push the plunger slowly to inject the solvent into the powder \nvial. Make sure not to aim the stream of solvent directly at the NovoSeven powder as this will \ncause foaming. \n\n \n• Gently swirl the vial until all the powder is dissolved. Do not shake the vial as this will cause \n\nfoaming. \n \nNovoSeven reconstituted solution is colourless and should be inspected visually for particulate matter \nand discolouration prior to administration. \n \nDo not store reconstituted NovoSeven in plastic syringes, unless as described in section 6.3. \n \nIt is recommended to use NovoSeven immediately after reconstitution, unless as described in section \n6.3. \n \nAdministration \n \n• Ensure that the plunger is pushed all the way in before turning the syringe upside down (it may \n\nhave been pushed out by the pressure in the syringe). If using a transfer needle, make sure the \ntransfer needle tip is in the solution. Hold the syringe with the vial upside down and pull the \nplunger to draw all the solution into the syringe. \n\n \n• If using a vial adapter, unscrew the vial adapter with the empty vial. If using a transfer needle, \n\nremove the transfer needle from the vial, replace the transfer needle cap, and twist the transfer \nneedle off the syringe. \n\n \n• NovoSeven is now ready for injection. Locate a suitable site, and slowly inject NovoSeven into \n\na vein over a period of 2 – 5 minutes without removing the needle from the injection site. \n \nSafely dispose of the syringe, vials and any unused product. Any unused medicinal product or waste \nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nPowder in vial and solvent in pre-filled syringe: \n \nAlways use an aseptic technique. \n \nReconstitution \n \n• The NovoSeven powder vial and pre-filled syringe with solvent should be at room temperature \n\nat reconstitution. Remove the plastic cap from the vial. If the cap is loose or missing, do not use \nthe vial. Wipe the rubber stopper on the vial with a sterile alcohol swab and allow it to dry for a \nfew seconds before use. Do not touch the rubber stopper after wiping it. \n\n \n• Remove the protective paper from the vial adapter. Do not take the vial adapter out of the \n\nprotective cap. If the protective paper is not fully sealed or it is broken do not use the vial \nadapter. Turn over the protective cap, and snap the vial adapter onto the vial. Lightly squeeze \nthe protective cap with the thumb and index finger. Remove the protective cap from the vial \nadapter. \n\n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\n• Screw the plunger rod clockwise into the plunger inside the pre-filled syringe until resistance is \nfelt. Remove the syringe cap from the pre-filled syringe by bending it down until the perforation \nbreaks. Do not touch the syringe tip under the syringe cap. If the syringe cap is loose or missing, \ndo not use the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n• Screw the pre-filled syringe securely onto the vial adapter until resistance is felt. Hold the pre-\n\nfilled syringe slightly tilted with the vial pointing downwards. Push the plunger rod to inject all \nthe solvent into the vial. Keep the plunger rod pressed down and swirl the vial gently until all \nthe powder is dissolved. Do not shake the vial as this will cause foaming. \n\n \nIf a larger dose is needed, repeat the procedure with additional vials, pre-filled syringes and vial \nadapters. \n \nThe NovoSeven reconstituted solution is colourless and should be inspected visually for particulate \nmatter and discolouration prior to administration. \n \nIt is recommended to use NovoSeven immediately after reconstitution. For storage conditions of the \nreconstituted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \nAdministration \n \n• Keep the plunger rod pushed completely in. Turn the syringe with the vial upside down. Stop \n\npushing the plunger rod and let it move back on its own while the reconstituted solution fills the \nsyringe. Pull the plunger rod slightly downwards to draw the mixed solution into the syringe. \n \n\n• While holding the vial upside down, tap the syringe gently to let any air bubbles rise to the top. \nPush the plunger rod slowly until all air bubbles are gone. \n\n \n If the entire dose is not required, use the scale on the syringe to see how much mixed solution is \n\nwithdrawn. \n \n• Unscrew the vial adapter with the vial. \n \n• NovoSeven is now ready for injection. Locate a suitable site, and slowly inject NovoSeven into \n\na vein over a period of 2 – 5 minutes without removing the needle from the injection site. \n \nSafely dispose of the used materials. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be \ndisposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \nProcedure for pooling of vials for hospital use only:  \n \nDuring in vitro studies, the chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours \nat 25°C in a 50 ml syringe (polypropylene). Compatibility with the product was demonstrated for the \nsystem consisting of a 50 ml syringe (polypropylene), a 2 m infusion tube (polyethylene) and an in-\nline filter with a 5 micrometer pore size. \n \nPooling of vials (hospital use only): \n \n• All steps should be completed under controlled and validated aseptic conditions by adequately \n\ntrained staff.  \n• If not reconstituted, pooled or used as recommended the in-use times and conditions prior to use \n\nare the responsibility of the user.  \n• Ensure that a vial adapter is used irrespective of presentation. \n• Reconstitute the product as described above under Reconstitution for relevant product \n\npresentation. Unscrew the empty syringe from the vial adapter and for both presentations ensure \nthat a vial adapter is attached to the vial containing reconstituted product.  \n\n\n\n 15 \n\n• Repeat the procedure with the appropriate number of additional vials, solvent vials/pre-filled \nsyringes and vial adapters. \n\n• Draw approximately 5 ml of sterile air into the 50 ml syringe (polypropylene). Screw the \nsyringe securely onto the vial adapter until resistance is felt. Hold the syringe slightly tilted with \nthe vial pointing downwards. Push the plunger rod gently to inject a little air into the vial. Turn \nthe syringe with the vial upside down and withdraw the contents of the vial into the syringe. \n\n• Repeat the above procedure with the remaining vials with reconstituted product, to obtain the \ndesired volume in the syringe. \n\n• An in-line filter with a 5 micrometer pore size must be ensured for administration. Ensure that \nthe syringe, the infusion tube and the in-line filter are primed and free of air before \nadministration. \n\n• The syringe with adequately reconstituted product is now ready for administration in a CE-\nmarked infusion pump (accepting a 50 ml syringe). \n\n• The infusion pump must only be operated by trained hospital personnel. \n \n \n7.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nOverleaf: NovoSeven user instructions \n \n \n1. What NovoSeven is and what it is used for \n \nNovoSeven is a blood coagulation factor. It works by making the blood clot at the site of bleeding, \nwhen the body's own clotting factors are not working. \n \nNovoSeven is used to treat bleeding, and to prevent excessive bleeding after surgery or other \nimportant treatments. Early treatment with NovoSeven reduces how much you bleed and for how long. \nIt works in all types of bleeds, including joint bleeds. This reduces the need for hospitalisation and \ndays absent from work and school. \nIt is used in certain groups of people: \n• If you were born with haemophilia and do not respond normally to factors VIII or IX treatment \n• If you have acquired haemophilia \n• If you have Factor VII deficiency \n• If you have Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (a bleeding disorder) and your condition cannot be \n\ntreated effectively with platelet transfusion, or if platelets are not readily available. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use NovoSeven \n \nDo not use NovoSeven \n• If you are allergic to eptacog alfa (active compound of NovoSeven) or any of the other \n\ningredients in this medicine (listed in section 6). \n• If you are allergic to mouse, hamster or cow proteins (such as cows’ milk). \n \n► If any of these apply to you, do not use NovoSeven. Talk to your doctor. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nBefore treatment with NovoSeven, make sure your doctor knows: \n\n\n\n 51 \n\n• If you have just had surgery \n• If you recently had a crush injury \n• If your arteries are narrowed by disease (atherosclerosis) \n• If you have an increased risk of blood clots (thrombosis) \n• If you have severe liver disease \n• If you have a serious blood infection \n• If you are prone to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, a condition where blood clots \n\ndevelop throughout the blood stream) you must be carefully monitored. \n \n► If any of these conditions apply to you, talk to your doctor before using the injection. \n \nOther medicines and NovoSeven \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDo not use NovoSeven at the same time as prothrombin complex concentrates or rFXIII. You should \ntalk to your doctor before using NovoSeven if you also use Factor VIII or IX products. \n \nThere is limited experience of using NovoSeven together with medicines called antifibrinolytic drugs \n(such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) which are also used to control bleeding. You should \ntalk to your doctor before using NovoSeven with these medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you use NovoSeven. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nThere are no studies on the effect of NovoSeven on the ability to drive and use machines. However, \nthere is no medical reason to think that it would affect your ability. \n \n \n3. How to use NovoSeven \n \nThe NovoSeven powder must be reconstituted with its solvent and injected into a vein. See overleaf \nfor detailed instructions. \n \nWhen to treat yourself \nStart treatment of a bleed as early as possible, ideally within 2 hours. \n• In cases of a mild or moderate bleed, you should treat yourself as early as possible, ideally at \n\nhome. \n• In case of a severe bleed you should contact your doctor. Usually severe bleeds are treated at the \n\nhospital and you can give yourself the first NovoSeven dose on the way there. \n \nDo not treat yourself for longer than 24 hours without consulting your doctor. \n• Each time you use NovoSeven, tell your doctor or hospital as soon as possible. \n• If bleeding is not controlled within 24 hours, contact your doctor immediately. You will usually \n\nneed hospital care. \n \nDose \nThe first dose should be given as early as possible after bleeding has started. Talk to your doctor about \nwhen to use the injections and how long to keep using them. \nThe dose will be worked out by your doctor, based on your body weight, condition and type of bleed. \nTo achieve the best results, follow the prescribed dose carefully. Your doctor might change the dose. \n \nIf you have haemophilia: \nThe usual dose is 90 micrograms for every 1 kilogram you weigh; you can repeat the injection every \n2–3 hours until bleeding is controlled. \n\n\n\n 52 \n\nYour doctor may recommend a single dose of 270 micrograms for every 1 kilogram you weigh. There \nis no clinical experience in people over 65 using this single dose. \n \nIf you have Factor VII deficiency: \nThe usual dose range is 15 to 30 micrograms for every 1 kilogram you weigh, for each injection. \n \nIf you have Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia: \nThe usual dose is 90 micrograms (range is 80 to 120 micrograms) for every 1 kilogram you weigh, for \neach injection. \n \nIf you inject more NovoSeven than you should \nIf you inject too much NovoSeven, get medical advice at once. \n \nIf you forget an injection of NovoSeven \nIf you forget an injection, or if you want to stop the treatment, get your doctor's advice. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects  \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 treatment episodes) \n• Allergic, hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions. Signs may include skin rashes, itching, \n\nflushing and hives; wheezing or difficulty breathing; feeling faint or dizzy; and severe swelling \nof the lips or throat, or at the injection site. \n\n• Blood clots in arteries in the heart (which could lead to a heart attack or angina), in the brain \n(which could lead to a stroke) or in the intestine and kidneys. Signs may include severe pain in \nthe chest, breathlessness, confusion, difficulty with speech or movement (paralysis) or \nabdominal pain. \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 treatment episodes) \n• Blood clots in the veins in lungs, legs, liver, kidneys or at site of injection. Signs may include \n\ndifficulty in breathing, red and painful swelling in the leg and abdominal pain. \n• Lack of effect or decreased response to treatment. \n \n► If you notice any of these serious side effects, get medical help immediately. Explain that you \n\nhave been using NovoSeven. \n \nRemind your doctor if you have a history of allergic reactions as you may need to be monitored more \ncarefully. In most cases of blood clots, the patients were predisposed to blood clotting disorders. \n \nOther rare side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 1,000 treatment episodes)  \n• Nausea (feeling sick) \n• Headache \n• Changes in some liver and blood tests. \n \nOther uncommon side effects \n(may affect up to 1 in 100 treatment episodes) \n• Allergic skin reactions including rash, itching and hives \n• Fever. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 53 \n\n \n \n5.

If you touch \nthe spike on the vial adapter germs from your \nfingers can be transferred. \n \n\n \n\n \n C \n\n \n\n• Place the vial on a flat and solid surface. \n \n• Turn over the protective cap, and snap the vial \n\nadapter onto the vial.  \n \n\nOnce attached, do not remove the vial adapter \nfrom the vial. \n\n \n\n\n\n 67 \n\n  D \n\n \n• Lightly squeeze the protective cap with your \n\nthumb and index finger as shown. \n \nRemove the protective cap from the vial \nadapter. \n\n \nDo not lift the vial adapter from the vial when \nremoving the protective cap. \n\n \n\n \n E \n\n \n3. Attach the plunger rod and the syringe \n \n• Grasp the plunger rod by the wide top-end and \n\ntake it out of the carton. Do not touch the sides \nor the thread of the plunger rod. If you touch \nthe sides or the thread, germs from your fingers \ncan be transferred. \n\n \nImmediately connect the plunger rod to the \nsyringe by turning it clockwise into the plunger \ninside the pre-filled syringe until resistance is \nfelt. \n\n \n\n \n F \n\n \n\n• Remove the syringe cap from the pre-filled \nsyringe by bending it down until the perforation \nbreaks. \n\n \nDo not touch the syringe tip under the syringe \ncap. If you touch the syringe tip, germs from \nyour fingers can be transferred. \n \nIf the syringe cap is loose or missing, do not \nuse the pre-filled syringe. \n\n \n G \n\n \n\n• Screw the pre-filled syringe securely onto the \nvial adapter until resistance is felt. \n\n \n \n\n H \n\n \n \n\n4. Reconstitute the powder with the solvent \n \n• Hold the pre-filled syringe slightly tilted with \n\nthe vial pointing downwards. \n \n• Push the plunger rod to inject all the solvent \n\ninto the vial. \n\n \n\n\n\n 68 \n\n  I \n\n \n• Keep the plunger rod pressed down and swirl \n\nthe vial gently until all the powder is dissolved. \n \n\nDo not shake the vial as this will cause \nfoaming. \n\n \n• Check the reconstituted solution. It must be \n\ncolourless. If you notice visible particles or \ndiscolouration, do not use it. Use a new \npackage instead. \n\n \n \n\n \n J \n\n \nUse the reconstituted NovoSeven at once to avoid infections. \n \nIf you cannot use it at once, see section 5 How to store NovoSeven on the other side of this leaflet. Do not \nstore the reconstituted solution without advice from your doctor or nurse. \n \n(I) \nIf your dose requires more than one vial, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and pre-filled \nsyringes until you have reached your required dose. \n• Keep the plunger rod pushed completely in.  \n \n• Turn the syringe with the vial upside down.  \n \n• Stop pushing the plunger rod and let it move \n\nback on its own while the reconstituted solution \nfills the syringe. \n\n \n• Pull the plunger rod slightly downwards to \n\ndraw the reconstituted solution into the syringe. \n \n• In case you only need part of the reconstituted \n\nsolution, use the scale on the syringe to see how \nmuch of the solution you withdraw, as instructed \nby your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n• If, at any point, there is too much air in the \n\nsyringe, inject the air back into the vial. \n \n• While holding the vial upside down, tap the \n\nsyringe gently to let any air bubbles rise to the \ntop. \n\n \n• Push the plunger rod slowly until all air \n\nbubbles are gone. \n \n\n \n K \n\n \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n• Unscrew the vial adapter with the vial.  \n \n• Do not touch the syringe tip. If you touch the \n\nsyringe tip, germs from your fingers can be \ntransferred. \n\n \n\n \n L \n\n \nInjecting NovoSeven with pre-filled syringe via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters \n \nCaution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard luer-lock \nconnections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the pre-filled syringe. \nThis incompatibility may prevent administration of the drug and/or result in damage to the needleless \nconnector. \n \nFollow the instructions for use for the needleless connector. Administration through a needleless connector may \nrequire withdrawal of the reconstituted solution into a standard 10 ml sterile luer-lock plastic syringe. This \nshould be done right after step J. \n \n \n5. Inject the reconstituted solution \n \nNovoSeven is now ready to inject into your vein.  \n \n• Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. \n \n• Inject slowly over 2 to 5 minutes. \n \nInjecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter or a \nsubcutaneous port: \n• Use a clean and germ free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your connector \n\nand CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. \n• Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 ml plastic syringe for withdrawal of the \n\nreconstituted solution. \n• If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after NovoSeven injection, use sodium chloride 9 mg/ml \n\nsolution for injection. \n \n\nDisposal \n \n• After injection, safely dispose of the syringe \n\nwith the administration set, the vial with the vial \nadapter, any unused NovoSeven and other waste \nmaterials as instructed by your doctor or nurse.  \n\n \n• Do not throw it out with the ordinary household \n\nwaste. \n\n \n M \n\n \n \nDo not disassemble the equipment before disposal.  \n \nDo not reuse the equipment. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
