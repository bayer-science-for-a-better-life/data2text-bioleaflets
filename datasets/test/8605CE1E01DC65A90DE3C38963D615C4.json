NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nDzuveo 30 micrograms sublingual tablet \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  \n \nEach sublingual tablet contains 30 micrograms of sufentanil (as citrate). For the full list of excipients, \nsee section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSublingual tablet. \n \nBlue-coloured flat-faced tablet with round edges and a diameter of 3 mm. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nDzuveo is indicated for the management of acute moderate to severe pain in adult patients. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDzuveo is to be administered by a healthcare professional in a medically monitored setting only. A \nmedically monitored setting must have equipment and personnel trained to detect and manage \nhypoventilation, and availability of supplemental oxygen and opioid antagonists, such as naloxone. \nDzuveo should only be prescribed and administered by healthcare professionals who are experienced \nin the management of opioid therapy; particularly opioid adverse reactions, such as respiratory \ndepression (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nDzuveo is provided in a disposable single-dose applicator, to be administered by a healthcare provider \nas needed by the individual patient, but no more than once every hour, resulting in a maximum dose of \n720 micrograms /day. Patients with a higher pain intensity at one hour after sufentanil treatment was \ninitiated required more frequent redosing compared to patients with lower pain intensity scores at one \nhour. \n \nDzuveo should not be used beyond 48 hours. \n \nElderly \nNo specific dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. However, elderly patients should be \nobserved closely for adverse reactions of sufentanil (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \nSufentanil should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or severe \nrenal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of sufentanil in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n\n\n\n3  \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor sublingual use only. \n \nDzuveo is to be administered by a healthcare professional from a disposable single-dose applicator \n(see section 6.6). The applicator is used as a placement aid for the healthcare professional to deliver \nthe tablet under the tongue, on an as needed basis, per patient request, with a minimum of 1 hour \nbetween doses. \n \nThe dispensed sublingual tablet should dissolve under the tongue and should not be chewed or \nswallowed. If swallowed, the oral bioavailability of Dzuveo is only 9% which would result in a sub- \ntherapeutic dose. Patients should not eat or drink and should minimise talking for 10 minutes after \neach dose of sufentanil 30 mcg sublingual tablet. In the case of an excessive dry mouth, patients may \nbe given ice cubes. Some insoluble excipients of the tablet may remain in the mouth after dissolution \nis complete; this is normal and does not indicate lack of absorption of sufentanil from the tablet. \n \nSee section 6.6 for instructions regarding handling of the Dzuveo sublingual tablet and applicator. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Significant \nrespiratory depression or pulmonary compromise. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRespiratory depression \n \nSufentanil may cause respiratory depression, for which the degree/severity is dose related. The \nrespiratory effects of sufentanil should be assessed by clinical monitoring, e.g. respiratory rate, \nsedation level and oxygen saturation. Patients at higher risk are those with respiratory impairment or \nreduced respiratory reserve. Respiratory depression caused by sufentanil can be reversed by opioid \nantagonists. Repeat antagonist administration may be required as the duration of respiratory depression \nmay last longer than the duration of the effect of the antagonist (see section 4.9). \n \nRisk from concomitant use of sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related medicinal \nproducts \n \nConcomitant use of sufentanil and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related medicinal \nproducts may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, \nconcomitant prescribing with these sedative medicines should be reserved for patients for whom \nalternative treatment options are not possible, or when sufentanil is used in an emergency setting. \n \nIntracranial pressure \n \nSufentanil should be used with caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the cerebral \neffects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired \nconsciousness. Sufentanil may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Sufentanil \nshould be used with caution in patients with brain tumours. \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nSufentanil may produce bradycardia. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients with \nprevious or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. \n \nSufentanil may cause hypotension, especially in hypovolemic patients. Appropriate measures should \nbe taken to maintain stable arterial pressure. \n\n\n\n4  \n\n \nImpaired hepatic or renal function \n \nSufentanil is primarily metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine and faeces. The duration of \nactivity may be prolonged in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment. Only limited data are \navailable for the use of sufentanil in such patients. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic or severe \nrenal impairment should be monitored carefully for symptoms of sufentanil overdose (see section 4.9). \n \nAbuse potential and tolerance \n \nSufentanil has potential for abuse. This should be considered when prescribing or administering \nsufentanil where there is concern about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion. \n \nPatients on chronic opioid therapy or opioid addicts may require higher analgesic doses than contained \nin Dzuveo. \n \nGastrointestinal effects \n \nSufentanil as a \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist may slow the gastrointestinal motility. Therefore, sufentanil \nshould be used with caution in patients at risk of ileus. \n \nSufentanil as a \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Therefore, \nsufentanil should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute \npancreatitis. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction with cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme \n \nSufentanil is primarily metabolised by the human cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme. Ketoconazole, a \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitor, can significantly increase the systemic exposure to sublingual sufentanil \n(maximal plasma levels (Cmax) increase of 19%, overall exposure to the active substance (AUC) \nincrease of 77% and prolong the time to reach maximum concentration by 41%. Similar effects with \nother potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. itraconazole, ritonavir) cannot be excluded. Any change in \nefficacy/tolerability associated with the increased exposure would be compensated in practice by an \nincrease in the amount of time between doses (see section 4.2). \n \nInteraction with calcium channel and/or beta blockers \n \nThe incidence and degree of bradycardia and hypotension with sufentanil may be greater in patients on \nchronic calcium channel and/or beta blocker therapy. \n \nCaution should be exercised in patients on these concomitant medicinal products and they should be \nclosely monitored. \n \nCentral nervous system (CNS) depressants \n \nThe concomitant use of CNS depressants including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics or \nother opioids, halogen gases or other non-selective CNS depressants (e.g. alcohol) may enhance \nrespiratory depression. \n \nWhen considering the use of sufentanil in a patient taking a CNS depressant, the duration of use of the \nCNS depressant and the patient\u2019s response should be assessed, including the degree of tolerance that \nhas developed to CNS depression. If the decision to begin sufentanil is made, the patient should be \nclosely monitored and a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n5  \n\nCo-administration of sufentanil with a serotonergic agent, such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake \nInhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), or Monoamine Oxidase \nInhibitors (MAOIs), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life threatening \ncondition. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors must not be taken in the 2 weeks before or at the same time \nas Dzuveo is given. \n \nOthers \n \nInteraction with other sublingually administered products or products intended to dilute/establish an \neffect in the oral cavity were not evaluated and simultaneous administration should be avoided. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of sufentanil in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Sufentanil should not be used in \npregnancy, because it crosses the placenta and the foetal respiratory center is sensitive to opiates. If \nsufentanil is administered to the mother during this time, an antidote for the child should be readily \navailable. Following long-term treatment sufentanil may cause withdrawl symptoms in the newborn. \nSufentanil is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSufentanil is excreted in human milk to such an extent that effects on the breastfed newborns/infants \nare likely. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain \nfrom sufentanil therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on the effects of sufentanil on fertility. Studies in rats have revealed reduced \nfertility and enhanced embryo mortality (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSufentanil has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not \nto drive or operate machinery if they experience somnolence, dizziness, or visual disturbance while \ntaking or after the treatment with sufentanil. Patients should only drive and use machines if sufficient \ntime has elapsed after the last administration of sufentanil. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most serious adverse reaction of sufentanil is respiratory depression, which occurred at a rate of \n0.6% in sufentanil clinical trials. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions seen in clinical trials and from post marketing \nexperience with sufentanil containing products were nausea, vomiting and pyrexia (\u22651/10 patients) \n(see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions identified either from clinical studies or from post marketing experience with other \nmedicinal products containing sufentanil are summarised in the table below.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nSufentanil overdose is manifested by an exaggeration of its pharmacological effects. Depending on \nindividual sensitivity, the clinical picture is determined by the degree of respiratory depression. This \nmay range from hypoventilation to respiratory arrest. Other symptoms that may occur are loss of \nconsciousness, coma, cardiovascular shock and muscle rigidity. \n \nManagement \n \nManagement of sufentanil overdose should be focused on treating symptoms of \u03bc-opioid receptor \nagonism, including administration of oxygen. Primary attention should be given to obstruction of \nairways and the necessity of assisted or controlled ventilation. \n \nAn opiate antagonist (e.g. naloxone) should be administered in the event of respiratory depression. \nThis does not rule out more direct countermeasures. The shorter duration of activity of the opiate \nantagonist compared to that of sufentanil should be taken into account. In that case, the opioid \nantagonist can be administered repeatedly or by infusion. \n \n \n\n\n\n9  \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anesthetics, opioid anesthetics, ATC Code: N01AH03. Mechanism of \naction \nSufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to \u03bc-opioid receptors. Sufentanil \nacts as a full agonist in \u03bc-opioid receptors. Sufentanil does not induce histamine release. All effects of \nsufentanil can immediately and completely be blocked by administration of a specific antagonist such \nas naloxone. \n \nPrimary pharmacodynamics effects \n \nAnalgesia \n \nAnalgesia induced by sufentanil is thought to be mediated via activation of \u03bc-opioid receptors \nprimarily within the CNS to alter processes affecting both the perception of and the response to pain. \nIn humans the potency is 7 to 10-fold higher than fentanyl and 500 to 1,000-fold higher than morphine \n(per oral). The high lipophilicity of sufentanil allows it to be administered sublingually and achieve a \nrapid onset of analgesic effect. \n \nSecondary pharmacodynamics effects \n \nRespiratory depression \n \nSufentanil may cause respiratory depression (see section 4.4) and also suppresses the cough reflex. \n \nOther CNS effects \n \nHigh doses of intravenously administered sufentanil are known to cause muscle rigidity, probably as a \nresult of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus. Hypnotic activity can be \ndemonstrated by EEG alterations. \n \nGastrointestinal effects \n \nAnalgesic plasma concentrations of sufentanil may provoke nausea and vomiting by irritation of the \nchemoreceptor trigger zone. \n \nGastrointestinal effects of sufentanil comprise decreased propulsive motility, reduced secretion and \nincreased muscle tone (up to spasms) of the sphincters of the gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nLow doses of intravenous sufentanil associated with likely vagal (cholinergic) activity cause mild \nbradycardia and mildly reduced systemic vascular resistance without significantly lowering blood \npressure (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular stability is also the result of minimal effects on cardiac preload, cardiac flow rate and \nmyocardial oxygen consumption. Direct effects of sufentanil on myocardial function were not \nobserved. \n \n\n\n\n10  \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAnalgesia \nThe efficacy of Dzuveo was evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving \n221 patients with moderate-to-severe acute postoperative pain (pain intensity of \u2265 4 on a 0-10 scale) \nafter abdominal (studied up to 48-hours) or orthopedic (bunionectomy) surgery (studied up to 12 \nhours). Of the 221 patients, 147 received active treatment and 74 received placebo. Patients were \npredominantly female (63%), mean age was 41 years (range 18-74 years), BMI 15.8 to 53.5 kg/m2, \nrace was predominately White (69%) and Black or African American (21%). Mean (SEM) baseline \nintensity in these trials was 6.48 (0.21) for the 12-hour bunionectomy trial in the sufenatil-treated \npatients and 5.98 (0.30) for placebo-treated patients. In the abdominal surgery trial, mean baseline pain \nintensity was 5.61 (0.13) for sufentanil-treated patients and 5.48 (0.18) for placebo-treated patients. \nIn both trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was the time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference \n(SPID) to baseline (measured on an 11-point NRS) over 12 hours (SPID12). Patients using Dzuveo \nhad a mean SPID12 score that was superior to patients using placebo (25.8 vs. 13.1) in abdominal \nsurgery patients (p<0.001) and (5.93 vs. -6.7) in bunionectomy patients (p=0.005) respectively. \nRescue analgesia was allowed in both studies, with a higher proportion of patients in the placebo \ngroup requiring rescue medication due to inadequate analgesia (64.8%, 100%; abdominal, \nbunionectomy) than in the sufentanil group (27.1%, 70.0%;. abdominal, bunionectomy). Onset of \nanalgesia, as measured by pain intensity difference to baseline scores, was greater (p<0.05) for \nsufentanil versus placebo by 15 minutes after the first dose in the abdominal study and 30 minutes in \nthe bunionectomy study. The majority (>90%) of healthcare professionals found Dzuveo easy to use. \nIn the two placebo-controlled clinical trials, the mean number of doses used in the first 6 hours of \ndosing was 2.8 tablets, with less frequent dosing in the following 6 hours (mean of 1.7 tablets). Over \n24 hours, the mean number of Dzuveo doses administered was 7.0 (210 micrograms/day). Patients \nwith a higher pain intensity at one hour after Dzuveo treatment was initiated required more frequent \nredosing compared to patients with lower pain intensity scores at one hour. \n \nRespiratory depression \nAnalgesic doses of sufentanil resulted in respiratory depressive effects in some patients in the clinical \ntrials, however, no patient treated with Dzuveo required use of an opioid reversal drug (e.g. naloxone). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sufentanil after administration of Dzuveo can be described as a two- \ncompartment model with first-order absorption. This route of administration results in higher absolute \nbioavailability than oral (swallowed) administration by avoiding intestinal and first-pass liver 3A4 \nenzyme metabolism. Mean absolute bioavailability after a single sublingual administration of the \nsufentanil tablet relative to a one-minute intravenous sufentanil infusion of the same dose was 53%. \n \nIn a study of a sufentanil 15 microgram sublingual tablet (with the same formulation as the \n\n30 microgram tablet), a substantially lower bioavailability of 9% after oral intake (swallowed) was \nobserved. Buccal administration showed an increased bioavailability of 78% when the tablets were \nplaced in front of the front lower teeth. \n\n \nMaximum concentrations of sufentanil are achieved approximately 60 minutes after a single dose; this \nis shortened to approximately 40 minutes following repeated hourly dosing. When Dzuveo is \nadministered every hour, steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved by 7 doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe central volume of distribution after intravenous application of sufentanil is approximately 14 litres \nand the volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 350 litres. \n \n\n\n\n11  \n\nBiotransformation \n \nBiotransformation takes place primarily in the liver and the small intestine. Sufentanil is mainly \nmetabolised in humans by the cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme system (see section 4.5). Sufentanil is \nrapidly metabolised to a number of inactive metabolites, with oxidative N- and O-dealkylation being \nthe major routes of elimination. \n \nElimination \n \nWith Dzuveo, first dose clearance in the typical patient of weight 78.5 kg and age 47 years is 84.2 \nL/hr. Steady-state clearance is 129.3 L/hr. Patient weight and age are key covariates on clearance. \n \nAfter single administration of Dzuveo, mean terminal phase half-live of 13.4 hours (range of 2.5 to \n34.4 hours) was observed. After multiple administrations, a longer mean terminal half-life of 15.7 \nhours (range 2.4 to 42.7 hours) was observed, owing to the higher plasma concentrations of sufentanil \nachieved after repeated dosing and due to the possibility to quantify these concentrations over a longer \ntime period. \n \nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Relationship \n \nWith administration of Dzuveo, clinical duration of analgesia is largely determined by the time for the \nsufentanil plasma concentration to drop from Cmax to 50% of Cmax after discontinuation of dosing \n(context sensitive half-time or CST\u00bd) rather than by the terminal half-life. Following either a single \ndose or multiple doses hourly over 12 hours, the median CST\u00bd remained 2.3 hours: the sublingual \ndelivery route thus substantially extends the duration of action associated with intravenous sufentanil \nadministration (CST\u00bd of 0.1 hours). Similar CST\u00bd values were observed following both single and \nrepeated administration, demonstrating that there is a predictable and consistent duration of action \nafter multiple dosing of the sublingual tablet. \n \nPatients requested dosing with Dzuveo to maintain plasma sufentanil concentrations averaging 40- 50 \npg/ml at 12 hours, with no effect based on age or body mass index (BMI), or mild to moderate renal or \nliver impairment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma sufentanil concentrations following usage of Dzuveo \ndid not identify renal function as a significant covariate for clearance. However, due to the limited \nnumber of patients with severe renal impairment studied, Dzuveo should be used with caution in such \npatients (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis for Dzuveo, hepatic function was not identified as a \nsignificant covariate for clearance. Due to the limited number of patients with moderate to severe \nhepatic impairment, a potential effect of hepatic dysfunction as covariate on clearance may not have \nbeen detected. Therefore, Dzuveo should be used with caution in such patients (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data exist for sufentanil in paediatric patients. \n \n\n\n\n12  \n\nElderly \n \nNo special population studies were performed using Dzuveo in the elderly. For Dzuveo, population \npharmacokinetic analysis showed an effect of age, with an 18% decrease in clearance in the elderly \n(above 65 years of age). \n \nEffect of BMI on dosing \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis with weight as a covariate showed that patients with a higher \nBMI dosed more frequently. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nFertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted in male and female rats. Increased \nmortality was noted in all treatment groups. \n \nLower pregnancy rates were noted following treatment of males suggesting the potential for an \nadverse effect on fertility in males. Increased resorption of foetuses and reduced litter size was noted \nin the high dose females suggesting the potential for foetotoxicity, likely due to maternal toxicity. \n \nMutagenicity \n \nThe Ames test revealed no mutagenic activity of sufentanil. Carcinogenicity \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with sufentanil. Local tolerance \nTwo local tolerance studies were conducted in the hamster cheek pouch with the sufentanil sublingual \ntablets. It was concluded from these studies that sufentanil sublingual tablets have no or minimal \npotential for local irritation. \n \n \n6.

prescribed by a doctor who is experienced in the use of strong painkillers like sufentanil and knows the effects it may have on you, in particular on your breathing (see 'warnings and precautions' above). the recommended dose is a maximum of one 30 microgram sublingual tablet per hour. the sublingual tablet will be given to you by a healthcare professional using the disposable single-dose applicator. the applicator will help your healthcare provider place one tablet under your tongue. the tablets dissolve under your tongue and should not be chewed, or swallowed because the tablet is not effective for pain relief unless it is allowed to dissolve under your tongue. you should not eat or drink and should talk as little as possible for 10 minutes after each dose. after receiving a dose you will not be given another dose for at least one hour. the maximum daily dose is 720 micrograms (24 tablets per day). dzuveo should not be used beyond 48 hours. after your treatment the medical staff will dispose of the applicator accordingly. if you use more dzuveo than you should the symptoms of overdose include severe breathing problems like slow and shallow breathing, loss of consciousness, extremely low blood pressure, collapse and muscle rigidity. if these start to develop, tell a doctor or nurse immediately. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine,
