PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.  \nMilky-white liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nActive immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus. \nThis indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects from the age of 18 years \nonwards following administration of two doses of the vaccine containing A/Vietnam/1194/2004 \n(H5N1)-like strain (see section 5.1). \n \nPrepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines \nand Diagnostics should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology: \nAdults and elderly (18 years of age and above): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks. \nPrepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines \nand Diagnostics has been evaluated in healthy adults (18-60 years of age) and healthy elderly (over 60 \nyears of age) following a 1, 22 day primary vaccination schedule, and booster vaccination (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.1). \nThere is limited experience in elderly over 70 years of age (see section 5.1). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nIn the event of an officially declared influenza pandemic due to A/H5N1 virus, persons previously \nvaccinated with one or two doses of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics that contained HA antigen derived \nfrom a different clade of the same influenza subtype as the influenza pandemic strain may receive a \nsingle dose of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics instead of two doses that are required in \npreviously unvaccinated individuals (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric population: \nThe safety and efficacy of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in subjects under 18 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data in subjects aged 6 months to 18 years of age are described in \nsection 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \nNo data are available in children aged less than 6 months. \n \nMethod of administration  \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) of this vaccine. \nHowever, in a pandemic situation caused by the strain included in this vaccine, it may be appropriate \nto give this vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis as defined above, provided that \nfacilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to residues (eggs and \nchicken proteins, ovalbumin, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and \ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)). \n \nVery limited data in subjects with co-morbidities, including immunocompromised subjects are \navailable for this H5N1 vaccine.  \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nImmunization shall be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infection. \n \nThe vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. \n \nThere are no data with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare \nproviders need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals \nwith thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection \nunless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n\nSome cross-protection was observed against related H5N1 virus variants in clinical trials (see section \n5.1).  \n \nSince a second dose is recommended, it should be noted that there are no safety, immunogenicity or \nefficacy data to support interchangeability of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics with other H5N1 monovalent vaccines. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nData obtained in adults showed that co-administration of adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine and seasonal \n(inactivated surface, non-adjuvanted) antigens did not lead to any interference neither for seasonal \nstrains nor for H5N1 strains.  \nSRH antibody response against an homologous H5N1 Vietnam strain at day 43 reached all CHMP \ncriteria for all 3 strains.  \nCo-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to \nadministration of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nNovartis Vaccines and Diagnostics alone.  \n \nTherefore the data indicate that Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal \ninfluenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs). \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics with other vaccines. \nIf co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on \nseparate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nA study in rabbits did not indicate reproductive or developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nLimited data was obtained from women who became pregnant during the course of clinical trials with \nPrepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines \nand Diagnostics or H1N1v vaccines adjuvanted with MF59C.1. \n \nIt is estimated that more than 90,000 women have been vaccinated during pregnancy with H1N1v \nvaccine Focetria which contains the same amount of adjuvant MF59C.1 as. Prepandemic Influenza \nvaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics \nHowever information on outcomes is currently limited. Preliminary data from spontaneously reported \nevents and ongoing post-marketing studies (pregnancy registry and prospective interventional study) \ndo not suggest direct or indirect harmful effects on influenza vaccines adjuvanted with MF59 with \nrespect to pregnancy, fertility, embryonic/foetal development, parturition, or post natal development.  \nSince Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis \nVaccines and Diagnostics is expected not to be used in an emergency situation, its administration \nduring pregnancy might be deferred as a precautionary approach.  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n\nHealthcare providers need to assess the benefit and potential risks of administering the vaccine to \npregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.  \n \nThere are no data regarding the use of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics during breast-feeding. The potential \nbenefits to the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering Prepandemic \nInfluenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and \nDiagnostics during breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 may affect the ability to drive or operate \nmachinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials in adults (18 years old and above). \n \nThe incidence of adverse reactions has been evaluated in six clinical trials involving approximately \n4,000 adults and elderly receiving (Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics at least 7.5 µg HA, adjuvanted). There \nwere 3678 subjects 18-60 years of age, 264 subjects 61-70 years of age, and 41 subjects greater than \n70 years of age. \n \nConsistent with the data observed by trial for solicited reactions, there was a general trend towards \ndecreased reports of local reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first injection.  \nIrrespective of antigen dose, almost all systemic reactions were reported on the day of vaccination \n(day 1) or during the 3 days immediately following. \n \nData on safety of a booster dose of the current Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface \nantigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics formulation are limited to three \ntrials (V87P1, V87P2 and V87P1E1) that included 116 adults and 56 elderly. No increase in reactions \nwas reported when a booster dose is administered 6 months-18 months later after the initial dosing \nseries. A slight increase in reactions in adults was reported when a booster dose is administered 18 \nmonths after the initial dosing series. In the elderly, the reported reactions increased with the third \nbooster dose only when compared with the second dose. \nThe adverse reaction rates reported after either vaccination dose (i.e. 1st, 2nd or booster) were similar \nand are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nVery common (≥1/10)  \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10)  \nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100)  \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)  \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:  \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nRare: convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: sweating \nUncommon: urticaria \nRare: eye swelling  \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n\nMuscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders \nVery common: myalgia \nCommon: arthralgia \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: nausea \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site \nredness, fatigue \nCommon: injection site ecchymosis, fever, malaise, shivering \nUncommon: influenza like illness \nRare: anaphylaxis  \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trial in children (6 months to 17 years old) (Study V87P6) \n \n \nRegardless of age, reactogencity was higher after the first dose than after the second vaccination. \nReactogenicity after a third dose, administered 12 months following the first dose, was higher than \nafter both first and second dose. The percentages of subjects reporting local reactions were higher in \nthe older age groups, mainly due to the higher reports for pain.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine ATC Code J07BB02. \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface \nantigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics following a two-dose administration \nand booster. \n \nImmune response against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1): \n \nAdults (18-60 years) \n \nA clinical trial (Study V87P1) was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant \nin 312 healthy adults. Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose \nadjuvanted) were administered three weeks apart to 156 healthy adults. In another clinical trial (Study \nV87P13) 2693 adult subjects were enrolled and received two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 \n(A/Vietnam/1194/2004; 7.5 µg HA/dose adjuvanted) administered three weeks apart. Immunogenicity \nwas assessed in a subset (n=197) of study population. \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adults measured by SRH assay was as follows: \n \n \nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \n \n\nStudy V87P1 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=149 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=197 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 85% (79-91) 91% (87-95) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 85% (78-90) 78% (72-84) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 7.74 (6.6-9.07) 4.03 (3.54-4.59) \n   \n\n \nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=69 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=128 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 94% (88-97) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 87% (77-94) 73% (65-81) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.87 (7.09-11) 2.71 (2.38-3.08) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nMN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging \nfrom 67% (60-74) to 85% (78-90) and 65% (58-72) to 83% (77-89), respectively. Immune response to \nvaccination assessed by MN assay is in line with results obtained with SRH. \n \nPersistence of antibodies after primary vaccination in this population was assessed by HI, SRH, and \nMN assays. Compared to the antibody levels obtained at day 43 after completion of primary \nvaccination schedules, antibody levels at day 202 were reduced by 1/5 to 1/2 from their prior levels. \n \nIn a phase 2 clinical trial (Study V87P3) adult subjects aged 18-65 years primed 6-8 years previously \nwith 2 doses of MF59-adjuvanted H5N3 vaccine /A/Duck/Singapore/97 were administered 2 booster \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n\ndoses of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nNovartis Vaccines and Diagnostics SRH results after the first dose, that mimic prepandemic \npriming plus single heterologous booster dose, met all CHMP criteria. \n \nElderly (>60 years) \n \nThe seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody \nto H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in subjects aged over 60 (limited number of subjects were above 70 \nyears of age) measured by SRH assay assessed in two clinical studies were as follows: \n \n\nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \nStudy V87P1 \n\n21 days after 2nd dose \nN=84 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=210 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 80% (70-88) 82% (76-87) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 70% (59-80) 63% (56-69) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 4.96 (3.87-6.37) 2.9 (2.53-3.31) \n   \n\n \nAnti-HA antibody (SRH) \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=66 \n\nStudy V87P13 \n21 days after 2nd dose \n\nN=143 \nBaseline Serostatus < 4 mm2 ≥ 4 mm2 \nSeroprotection rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 82% (75-88) \nSeroconversion rate (95%CI)* 82% (70-90) 54% (45-62) \nSeroconversion factor (95%CI)** 8.58 (6.57-11) 1.91 (1.72-2.12) \n\n* measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm2 \n** geometric mean ratios of SRH \n \nMN results against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 indicate a seroprotection and seroconversion rate ranging \nfrom of 57% (50-64) to 79% (68-87) and 55% (48-62) to 58% (47-69) respectively.

See section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use. \n \nInformation from non-clinical trials \n \nEfficacy against challenge with virus homologous and heterologous to vaccine strains was evaluated \nin the ferret model. Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nNovartis Vaccines and Diagnostics containing HA from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (homologous to the \nchallenge strain) and an Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics -like H5N1 vaccine, containing hemagglutinin from \nthe A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005-like (heterologous to the challenge strain) were tested. Groups of 8 ferrets \nreceived one (day 21) or two (days 0 and 21) doses of vaccine containing 3.75 or 7.5 micrograms of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n\nantigen. Control animals received adjuvant alone. Animals were challenged by the intranasal route on \nday 42 with a lethal dose of A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus. Animals were monitored for 16-17 days after \nchallenge to allow for a comprehensive assessment of disease progression, including the time of onset \nof symptoms, mortality, or subsequent recovery. \n \nAll (100%) animals receiving 2 doses of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics were protected, and 94% of animals \nreceiving a single dose of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics were protected. 87% of animals challenged with virus \nheterologous to the vaccine strain after 2 doses of vaccine were protected, and a single dose of \nheterologous vaccine protected 56% of the animals. All control animals died within 7 days of \nchallenge. Vaccination protected animals from lethal challenge with virus homologous and \nheterologous to the vaccine. \n \nIn a similar study, intranasal challenge was delayed until approximately 4 months after the second \ndose of vaccine containing either 3.75 or 7.5 micrograms of antigen was administered. In this study \n100% of animals were protected against homologous challenge, and 81% of animals were protected \nagainst heterologous challenge. Vaccination protected animals from lethal challenge even when HI \nantibody titers were low or undetectable. \n \nEfficacy against challenge with the heterologous virus A/Indonesia/5/05 was also tested. Groups of 6 \nferrets received one dose of vaccine (day 21) containing 3.75 micrograms of antigen or two doses of \nvaccine (days 0 and 21) containing either 1.0 or 3.75 micrograms of antigen (A/Vietnam/1194/2004). \nA lethal challenge was administered by the intratracheal route on day 49. Two doses of vaccine \nprotected 92% of animals, and a single dose of vaccine protected 50% of animals against the \nA/Indonesia/5/05 virus. Compared to the adjuvant control group, lung damage was reduced in \nvaccinated groups. Viral shedding and viral titers in lungs were also reduced, suggesting that \nvaccination may reduce the risk of viral transmission. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data obtained with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics and with seasonal influenza vaccine containing \nMF59C.1 adjuvant reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated \ndose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, and reproductive and developmental toxicity (through \nthe end of the lactation period). \n \n \n6.

Such \nsituation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for \nrisk-benefit balance in a pandemic. Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent \nof exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated. \nIn addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety \nUpdate Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in \nthe European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue. \n \nIn consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared and the prepandemic vaccine is used, the MAH \nshall submit more frequent simplified periodic safety update reports with a format and a periodicity \ndefined in the \"CHMP Recommendations for the Core Risk Management Plan for Influenza Vaccines \nprepared from viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and intended for use outside of the core \ndossier context\" (EMEA/49993/2008), and any subsequent update. \n \nOfficial batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, the official \nbatch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX III \n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA.

WHAT PREPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE (H5N1) (SURFACE ANTIGEN, \n\nINACTIVATED, ADJUVANTED) NOVARTIS VACCINES AND DIAGNOSTICS IS \nAND WHAT IT IS USED FOR \n\n \nPrepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines \nand Diagnostics is a vaccine for use in adults (from 18 to 60 years old). and elderly (over 60 years \nold). It is intended to be given before or during the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused \nby the H5N1 type of the virus. \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around \nthe world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of an ordinary flu but may be more \nsevere.  \n \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defense system) will \nproduce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can \ncause flu.  \n \nAs with all vaccines, Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nNovartis Vaccines and Diagnostics may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU RECEIVE PREPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE (H5N1) \n\n(SURFACE ANTIGEN, INACTIVATED, ADJUVANTED) NOVARTIS VACCINES AND \nDIAGNOSTICS \n\n \nYou should not receive Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics: \n \n• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of \n\nPrepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis \nVaccines and Diagnostics (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances \nthat may be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n26 \n\nformaldehyde, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics) or cetyltrimethylammonium \nbromide (CTAB). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath \nand swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for \nyou to have the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in \ncase of an allergic reaction. \n\n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nTake special care with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics: \n \n• if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient contained in the vaccine, to egg and, chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, \nkanamycin and neomycin sulphate (antibiotics) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) \n(see section 6. Further information); \n\n \n• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then \n\nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still \nbe vaccinated with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, \nadjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics; \n\n \n• if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \n\nfew weeks after vaccination with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics the results of these tests may not be \ncorrect. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Prepandemic \nInfluenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and \nDiagnostics. \n\n \n• in the presence of immune deficiencies Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \n\ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics may be administered but a \nprotective immune response may not be elicited. \n\n \nIn any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, \nor may need to be delayed. \n \nPlease inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nTaking other medicines \n \nPlease tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.  \n \nData obtained in adults showed that Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, \ninactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics can be given at the same time as non-\nadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines, with injections made into separate limbs. In such cases, you \nshould be aware that the side effects may be more intense. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nLimited data was obtained from women who became pregnant with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine \n(H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics during the \ncourse of clinical trials. \nYour doctor needs to assess the benefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine if you are \npregnant or breast-feeding. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to \nbecome pregnant. You should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive Prepandemic \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n27 \n\nInfluenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and \nDiagnostics.  \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding and follow his advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSome effects mentioned under section 4. “Possible side effects” may affect the ability to drive or use \nmachines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) \n(surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics \n \nThis medicinal contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) \nper 0.5 ml dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free. \n \n \n3. HOW PREPANDEMIC INFLUENZA VACCINE (H5N1) (SURFACE ANTIGEN, \n\nINACTIVATED, ADJUVANTED) NOVARTIS VACCINES AND DIAGNOSTICS IS \nGIVEN \n\n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations.  \nThe vaccine will be injected into the muscles of the upper arm (deltoid muscle). The vaccine should \nnever be given into a vein. \n \nAdults and elderly (18 years of age and above): \nOne dose of 0.5 ml will be given. A second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least \n3 weeks. \nThere is limited experience in elderly over 70 years of age. \n \nUse in children \nThere is limited experience in children between 6 months and 17 years of age. \n \nVisually inspect the suspension prior to administration.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) \nNovartis Vaccines and Diagnostics can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nAllergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware \nof this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nIn the clinical trials with the vaccine, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. The side-\neffects are generally similar to those related to the seasonal flu vaccine. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \ncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \nuncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \nrare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n28 \n\nvery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred with Prepandemic Influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface \nantigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in clinical studies in adults, \nincluding the elderly: \n \nVery common: \nPain, hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, injection site swelling, pain at \nthe site of injection, aching muscles, headache, sweating, fatigue. \n \nCommon:  \nBrusing of the skin at the injection site, fever and nausea, generally feeling unwell and shivering. \n \nUncommon:  \nFlu like symptoms. \n \nRare:  \nConvulsions, eye swelling and anaphylaxis. \n \nThese side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT \nYOUR DOCTOR. \n \nSide effects from clinical study in children (6 months to 17 years of age) \nA clinical study was conducted with the same vaccine in children. General side effects reported very \ncommonly in the 6 months to 35 months of age group were injection site redness, muscle ache, \nirritability and unusual crying. Very commonly reported reactions in the 36 months to 17 years of age \ngroup were pain, headache and fatigue. \n \nOther rare side effects observed after routine use: \n \nThe side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with Focetria \nH1N1v vaccine. \n \nGeneralised skin reactions including itching, urticaria (hives), rash or swelling of the skin and mucous \nmembranes. \nDisorders of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \nHeadache, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting. \nNeurological disorders such as severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves, tingling, \nfits, and neuritis (inflammation of nerves).  \nSwollen lymph nodes, palpitations, weakness, pain in the extremities and cough. \nAllergic reactions possibly with shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the throat, or leading to a \ndangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Doctors are aware of \nthis possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. \n \nData in children and adolescents suggest a slight decrease in side effects after the second dose of the \nvaccine, with no increase in rates of fever. \n \nIn addition, the side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with \nvaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. These side effects may occur with Prepandemic \nInfluenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) Novartis Vaccines and \nDiagnostics. \n \nLow blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising. \nVasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney \nproblems), and exudative erythema multiforme (type of allergic skin reaction that occurs in response \nto medications, infections, or illness).  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nro\ndu\n\nct \nno\n\n lo\nng\n\ner\n au\n\nth\nor\n\nise\nd\n\n\n\n29 \n\nNeurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), and a \ntype of paralysis known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome.  \n \nIf any of these side effects occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nIf any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please \ntell your doctor. \n \n \n5.
