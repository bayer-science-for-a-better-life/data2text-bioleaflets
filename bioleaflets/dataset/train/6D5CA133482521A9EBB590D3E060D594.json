NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOPTISON 0.19 mg/ml dispersion for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOPTISON consists of perflutren-containing microspheres of heat treated human albumin, suspended in \nhuman albumin solution, 1%. \n \nConcentration: Perflutren-containing microspheres, 5-8 x 108/ml with a mean diameter range of 2.5 - \n4.5 \u00b5m. \nThe approximate amount of perflutren gas in each ml of OPTISON is 0.19 mg. \n \nExcipient with known effect: \nEach ml contains 0.15 mmol (3.45 mg) of sodium. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersion for injection. \n \nClear solution with white microsphere layer on top.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nOPTISON is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in patients with suspected or \nestablished cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac chambers, enhance left \nventricular endocardial border delineation with resulting improvement in wall motion visualisation. \nOPTISON should only be used in patients where the study without contrast enhancement is \ninconclusive. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nOPTISON should only be administered by physicians experienced in the field of diagnostic ultrasound \nimaging. \n \nBefore administering OPTISON, please see section 6.6 for instructions for use/handling. \n \nThis medicinal product is intended for left ventricular opacification after intravenous administration. \nUltrasound imaging must be performed during injection of OPTISON as optimal contrast effect is \nobtained immediately after administration. \n \nPosology \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml - 3.0 ml per patient. A dose of 3.0 ml is usually sufficient, but some  \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\npatients may need higher doses. The total dose should not exceed 8.7 ml per patient. The duration of \nthe useful imaging time is 2.5 - 4.5 minutes for a dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml. OPTISON could be repeatedly \nadministered, however, the clinical experience is limited. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of OPTISON in children and adolescents below 18 years has not been \nestablished. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  Pulmonary \nhypertension with a systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 90 mm Hg. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity has been reported. Care should therefore be exercised. A course of action should be \nplanned in advance with necessary drugs and equipment available for immediate treatment, in case a \nserious reaction should occur. \n \nThe experience of OPTISON in severely ill patients is limited. There is limited clinical experience \nwith OPTISON in patients with certain severe states of cardiac, pulmonary, renal and hepatic disease. \nSuch clinical states include adult respiratory distress syndrome, the use of artificial respiration with \npositive end-expiratory pressure, severe heart failure (NYHA IV), endocarditis, acute myocardial \ninfarction with on-going angina or unstable angina, hearts with prosthetic valves, acute states of \nsystemic inflammation or sepsis, known states of hyperactive coagulation system and/or recurrent \nthromboembolism, renal or hepatic end-stage disease. OPTISON should be used in these categories of \npatients only after careful consideration and monitored closely during and after administration. Other \nroutes of administration not specified in section 4.2 above (e.g. intracoronary injection) are not \nrecommended. \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation/removal of viruses.  Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded.  \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThere are no reports of virus transmissions with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that OPTISON is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the product. \n \nOPTISON contrast echocardiography should be accompanied by ECG monitoring. \n \nIn animal studies, the application of echo-contrast agents revealed biological side effects (e.g. \nendothelial cell injury, capillary rupture) by interaction with the ultrasound beam. Although these \nbiological side effects have not been reported in humans, the use of a low mechanical index and end-\ndiastolic triggering is recommended. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nEfficacy and safety in patients below 18 years has not been studied. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \nUse during anaesthesia with halothane and oxygen has not been studied. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThe safety of OPTISON for use during human pregnancy has not been established. In pregnant rabbits \nexposed to daily doses of 2.5 ml/kg (approximately 15 x the maximum recommended clinical dose) \nduring organogenesis, maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity including a slight to extreme \ndilation of ventricles in the brain of developing rabbit embryos was observed. The clinical relevance of \nthis finding is unknown. Therefore, OPTISON should not be used in pregnancy unless benefit \noutweighs risk and it is considered necessary by the physician. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether OPTISON is excreted in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised \nwhen OPTISON is administered to breast-feeding women. \n \n4.7 Effects on the ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nAdverse reactions to OPTISON are rare and usually of a non-serious nature. In general, the \nadministration of human albumin has been associated with transient altered taste, nausea, flushing, \nrash, headache, vomiting, chills and fever. Anaphylactic reactions have been associated with the \nadministration of human albumin products. The reported adverse events following the use of \nOPTISON in Phase III human clinical studies have been mild to moderate with subsequent full \nrecovery. \n \nIn clinical trials with OPTISON, undesirable effects were reported as adverse events with the \nfollowing frequencies given in the table below: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are \npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ Class Undesirable Effects Frequency \n\n \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nEosinophilia Uncommon \n \n\nNervous system disorders Dysgeusia (altered taste), headache \n \nTinnitus, dizziness, paraesthesia \n\nCommon \n \nRare \n\nEye disorders Visual disturbances Not known* \nCardiac disorders Ventricular tachycardia Rare \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea Uncommon \n \n\nVascular disorders Flushing Common \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea Common \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nWarm sensation \n \nChest pain \n\nCommon \n \nUncommon \n\nImmune system disorders \n \n\nAllergic type symptoms (e.g. \nanaphylactoid reaction or -shock, face \noedema, urticaria) \n\nNot known* \n\n* Reactions for which no frequency rate can be provided due to lack of clinical trial data have  \n   been classified as \u201cNot known\u201d. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.  \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \nIn the Phase I trial, healthy volunteers have received up to 44.0 ml of OPTISON and experienced no \nsignificant adverse events. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ultrasound contrast medium, ATC Code: V08D A01 \n \nWhen used in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound, OPTISON provides opacification of cardiac \nchambers, improvement in delineation of endocardial borders, enhancement of the Doppler signal, and \nvisualisation of wall motion and blood flow within the heart. \n \nThe ultrasound echoes from blood and biological soft tissues such as fat and muscles are generated at \ninterfaces due to small differences in the ultrasonic properties of the tissues. The ultrasonic properties \nof microspheres containing perflutren are very different from that of soft tissue and will generate \nstrong echoes. \n \nOPTISON consists of perflutren -containing microspheres. The microspheres have a mean diameter of \n2.5 - 4.5 microns and concentrations of 5-8 x 108 microspheres/ml. Microspheres in this size range \ncontribute to the contrast effect by generating strongly enhanced echoes. \n \nAs OPTISON consists of microspheres that are stable and small enough for transpulmonary passage, it \nwill also give enhanced echo signals in the left heart cavities. \n \nAs a consequence of the complex relationship between the concentration of the microspheres and the \nultrasound signal, data processing within the ultrasound equipment and the fact that each individual \nresponds differently due to variability in cardiac and pulmonary function, a strict dose/response \nrelationship cannot be defined. The dose of OPTISON will therefore have to be adjusted individually, \nalthough clinical studies have shown that an initial dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml per patient can be \nrecommended for left heart opacification. Higher doses produce greater contrast effect of longer \nduration. Duration of useful contrast effect at the recommended dose is adequate to perform a \ncomplete echocardiographic examination including Doppler assessment. \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nUse the smallest dose for adequate opacification of cavities since larger doses produce image blocking \neffects with the possibility of obscuring important information. \n \nIn two uncontrolled studies including a total of 42 children and adolescents, aged 8 months to 19 \nyears, the safety profile appeared to be similar to that seen in adults. Doses administered in one study \nwere 0.2 ml above 25 kg body weight and 0.1ml under 25 kg, and in a second study 0.5ml above 20 \nkg body weight and 0.3 ml under 20 kg, by bolus peripheral intravenous injection followed by a saline \nflush. Low mechanical index was used for ultrasound imaging. \n \nThe effect of OPTISON on pulmonary haemodynamics was studied in a prospective, open-label study \nof 30 patients scheduled for pulmonary artery catheterisation, including 19 with an elevated baseline \npulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) (>35 mmHg; mean 70.1\u00b133.0 mmHg; range 36.0-176.0 \nmmHg) and 11 with a normal PASP (\u226435 mmHg; mean 29.3\u00b14.6 mmHg; range 22.0-35.0 mmHg). \nSystemic haemodynamic parameters and ECGs were also evaluated. No clinically important \npulmonary haemodynamic, systemic haemodynamic, or ECG changes were observed. This study did \nnot assess the effect of OPTISON on visualisation of cardiac or pulmonary structures. \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing intravenous injection of 0.21 to 0.33 ml/kg of OPTISON to healthy volunteers, the \nperflutren component of OPTISON was rapidly and nearly completely eliminated in less than 10 \nminutes with a dominating pulmonary elimination half-life of 1.3\u00b10.7 minutes. The perflutren levels \ndetected in blood following this dosage were too low and transient to accurately determine \npharmacokinetic parameters. \n \nThe disposition and elimination of the albumin microspheres have not been studied in humans. \nInformation obtained from a preclinical study in rats with 125I-labelled albumin microspheres indicated \nthat microspheres were rapidly cleared from the circulation, and radio-labelled microspheres, albumin \nshells and 125I were taken up primarily in the liver. The primary route of elimination of radioactivity \nwas the urine. High levels of radioactivity were also retained in lungs for a considerable time, approx. \n10% of the total dose 40 minutes after dose administration (cf. 35% in liver). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. In the rabbit embryotoxicity study, a \nsignificant increase in the number of foetuses with dilated ventricles in the brain was observed (see \nsection 4.6). No such finding was observed in the rat embryotoxicity study. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1  List of excipients \n \nHuman albumin  \nSodium chloride  \nN-acetyltryptophan  \nCaprylic acid \nSodium hydroxide (pH adjustment) \nWater for injections  \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nOPTISON must not be mixed with other medicinal products. A separate syringe should be used. \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n \n6.3 Shelf life  \n \nUnopened vial in the outer packaging: 2 years. \n \nFinished product after rubber stopper perforation: 30 minutes.  \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore upright in a refrigerator (2oC - 8\u00baC). \nStorage at room temperature (up to 25\u00baC) for 1 day is acceptable. \nDo not freeze. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n3 ml type I glass vial, closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper, and sealed with aluminium cap with \ncoloured plastic flip-off top. \n \nOPTISON is supplied as: 1 vial of 3 ml or 5 vials of 3 ml. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nLike all parenteral products, the vials of OPTISON should be inspected visually for integrity of the \ncontainer. \n \nVials are intended for single use only. Once the rubber stopper has been penetrated, the contents \nshould be used within 30 minutes and any unused product discarded. \n \nOPTISON in the non-resuspended form has a white layer of microspheres on top of the liquid phase \nthat requires resuspension before use. Homogenous white suspension after resuspension. \n \nThe following instructions should be followed: \n \n- Cold solutions taken directly from the refrigerator should not be injected. \n \n- Allow the vial to reach room temperature and inspect the liquid phase for particulate matter or \n\nprecipitates before resuspension. \n \n- Insert a 20 G plastic cannula in a large antecubital vein, preferably of the right arm. Attach a \n\nthree-way stopcock to the cannula. \n \n- The OPTISON vial must be inverted and gently rotated for approximately three minutes to \n\ncompletely resuspend the microspheres. \n \n- Complete resuspension is indicated by a uniformly opaque white suspension and absence of any \n\nmaterial on stopper and vial surfaces. \n \n- OPTISON should be withdrawn with care into a syringe within 1 minute after resuspension. \n \n- Any pressure instability within the vial should be avoided since it may cause disruption of \n\nmicrospheres and loss of contrast effect. Thus, vent the vial with a sterile spike or with a sterile \n18 G needle before withdrawing the suspension into the injection syringe. Do not inject air into \nthe vial as this will damage the product. \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n \n- Use the suspension within 30 minutes after withdrawal. \n \n- OPTISON will segregate in an undisturbed syringe and must be resuspended before use. \n \n- Resuspend the microspheres in the syringe immediately before injection by holding the syringe \n\nhorizontally between the palms of the hands and rolling it quickly back and forth for no less \nthan 10 seconds. \n\n \n- Inject the suspension through the plastic cannula, no smaller than 20 G at a maximum injection \n\nrate of 1.0 ml/s. \n Warning: Never use any other type of route but the open flow connection. If injected otherwise \n\nOPTISON bubbles will be destroyed. \n \n- Immediately before injection a careful visual inspection of the syringe is mandatory in order to \n\nensure complete suspension of the microspheres. \n \nImmediately after injection of OPTISON, 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninjection or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection should be injected at a rate of 1 ml/s. \nAlternately, the flushing may be performed by infusion. The infusion set should then be attached to \nthe three-way stopcock and intravenous infusion started at a \u201cto keep open\u201d (TKO) rate. Immediately \nafter OPTISON injection, the intravenous infusion should be wide open until contrast begins to fade \nfrom the left ventricle. The infusion should then be returned to a TKO rate. \n \n \n7. MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \nGE Healthcare AS \nNycoveien 1 \nNO-0485 Oslo, Norway \n \n \n8.

What OPTISON is and what it is used for  \n \nOPTISON is an ultrasound contrast agent that helps to obtain clearer pictures (scan) of the heart during \nan echocardiography (a procedure where an image of the heart is obtained by using ultrasound). \nOPTISON improves the visualization of the inner cardiac walls in patients where the walls are difficult \nto see. \n \nOPTISON contains microspheres (tiny gas bubbles) that after injection travel through the veins to the \nheart and fill the left heart chambers, allowing the doctor to visualise and asses the function of the heart.   \n \nThis medicine is for diagnostic use only. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use OPTISON \n \nDo not use OPTISON \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to perflutren or any of the other ingredients of OPTISON (listed \n\nin section 6).  \n- if you have severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 90 mm Hg). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using OPTISON   \n- if you have any known allergies \n- if you have a severe heart, lung, kidney or liver disease. The experience of OPTISON in severely ill \n\npatients is limited \n- if you have an artificial valve in your heart \n- if you have acute severe inflammation or sepsis \n- if you have a known blood clotting problem \n \nYour heart activity and rhythm will be monitored when you get OPTISON. \n \n \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nEfficacy and safety in patients below 18 years has not been established. \n \nWhen medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent \ninfections being passed on to patients.  These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to \nmake sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools \nof plasma for signs of virus/infections.  Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the \nprocessing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses.  Despite these measures, when \nmedicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on \ninfection cannot be totally excluded.  This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other \ntypes of infections. \n \nThere are no reports of virus infections with albumin manufactured to European Pharmacopoeia \nspecifications by established processes. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of OPTISON the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nOther medicines and OPTISON  \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.   \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nThe safety of OPTISON for use during human pregnancy has not been fully established. Therefore, the \nmedicine should not be used in pregnancy unless benefit outweighs risk and it is considered necessary by \nthe doctor. However, because OPTISON is based on human albumin (the main protein in our blood), it is \nhighly unlikely that it will have any harmful effects in pregnancy.  \n \nIt is not known whether OPTISON passes into human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when \nOPTISON is administered to nursing women.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo effects are known. \n \nOPTISON contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use OPTISON \n \nOPTISON should only be administered by doctors experienced in the field of diagnostic ultrasound \nimaging. \n \nOPTISON is administered via an intravenous injection to allow the microspheres to enter the heart \nchamber and fill the left heart chamber. OPTISON is injected during the ultrasound examination in order \nto allow the doctor to assess the function of your heart.  \n \nThe recommended dose is 0.5 ml - 3.0 ml per patient. A dose of 3.0 ml is usually sufficient, but some \npatients may need higher doses. This dose might be repeated if needed. The duration of the useful \nimaging time is 2.5 - 4.5 minutes for a dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml.  \n \nImmediately after injection of OPTISON, 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml solution for injection or \nglucose 50 mg/ml solution for injection should be injected at a rate of 1 ml/s to optimise the effect of the \ncontrast agent. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nIf you are given more OPTISON than you should \nEffects suspected to be due to overdose have not been reported. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, OPTISON can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects to OPTISON are rare and usually not serious.

A dose of 3.0 ml is usually sufficient, but some \npatients may need higher doses. The total dose should not exceed 8.7 ml per patient. The duration of \nthe useful imaging time is 2.5 - 4.5 minutes for a dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml. OPTISON could be repeatedly \nadministered, however, the clinical experience is limited. \n \nUse the smallest dose for adequate opacification of cavities since larger doses produce image blocking \neffects with the possibility of obscuring important information. \n \nLike all parenteral products, the vials of OPTISON should be inspected visually for integrity of the \ncontainer. \n \nVials are intended for single use only. Once the rubber stopper has been penetrated, the contents should be \nused within 30 minutes and any unused product discarded. \n \nOPTISON in the non-resuspended form has a white layer of microspheres on top of the liquid phase that \nrequires resuspension before use.  Homogenous white suspension after resuspension. \n \nThe following instructions should be followed: \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n- Cold solutions taken directly from the refrigerator should not be injected. \n \n- Allow the vial to reach room temperature and inspect the liquid phase for particulate matter or \n\nprecipitates before resuspension. \n \n- Insert a 20 G plastic cannula in a large antecubital vein, preferably of the right arm. Attach a three-\n\nway stopcock to the cannula. \n \n- The OPTISON vial must be inverted and gently rotated for approximately three minutes to \n\ncompletely resuspend the microspheres. \n \n- Complete resuspension is indicated by a uniformly opaque white suspension and absence of any \n\nmaterial on stopper and vial surfaces. \n \n- OPTISON should be withdrawn with care into the syringe within 1 minute after resuspension. \n \n- Any pressure instability within the vial should be avoided since it may cause disruption of \n\nmicrospheres and loss of contrast effect. Thus, vent the vial with a sterile spike or with a sterile \n18 G needle before withdrawing the suspension into the injection syringe. Do not inject air into \nthe vial as this will damage the product. \n\n \n- Use the suspension within 30 minutes after withdrawal. \n \n- OPTISON will segregate in an undisturbed syringe and must be resuspended before use. \n \n- Resuspend the microspheres in the syringe immediately before injection by holding the syringe \n\nhorizontally between the palms of the hands and rolling it quickly back and forth for no less than 10 \nseconds. \n\n \n- Inject the suspension through the plastic cannula, no smaller than 20 G at a maximum injection rate \n\nof 1.0 ml/s. \n Warning: Never use any other type of route but the open flow connection. If injected otherwise \n\nOPTISON bubbles will be destroyed. \n \n- Immediately before injection a careful visual inspection of the syringe is mandatory in order to \n\nensure complete resuspension of the microspheres. \n \nImmediately after injection of OPTISON, 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection \nor glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for injection should be injected at a rate of 1 ml/s.  \n \nAlternatively, the flushing may be performed by infusion. The infusion set should then be attached to the \nthree-way stopcock and intravenous infusion started at a \u201dto keep open\u201d (TKO) rate. Immediately after \nOPTISON injection the intravenous infusion should be wide open until contrast begins to fade from the \nleft ventricle. The infusion should then be returned to a TKO rate. \n \n\n\n\tANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients. these include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. there are no reports of virus infections with albumin manufactured to european pharmacopoeia specifications by established processes. it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of optison the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. other medicines and optison tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding the safety of optison for use during human pregnancy has not been fully established. therefore, the medicine should not be used in pregnancy unless benefit outweighs risk and it is considered necessary by the doctor. however, because optison is based on human albumin (the main protein in our blood), it is highly unlikely that it will have any harmful effects in pregnancy. it is not known whether optison passes into human milk. therefore, caution should be exercised when optison is
