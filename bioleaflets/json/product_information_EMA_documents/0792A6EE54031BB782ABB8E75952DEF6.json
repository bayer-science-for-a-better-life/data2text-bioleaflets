This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMyalepta 3 mg powder for solution for injection. \nMyalepta 5.8 mg powder for solution for injection. \nMyalepta 11.3 mg powder for solution for injection. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nMyalepta 3 mg powder for solution for injection \nEach vial contains 3 mg of metreleptin*. \n \nAfter reconstitution with 0.6 mL water for injections (see section 6.6), each mL contains 5 mg of \nmetreleptin. \n \nMyalepta 5.8 mg powder for solution for injection \nEach vial contains 5.8 mg of metreleptin*. \n \nAfter reconstitution with 1.1 mL water for injections (see section 6.6), each mL contains 5 mg of \nmetreleptin. \n \nMyalepta 11.3 mg powder for solution for injection \nEach vial contains 11.3 mg of metreleptin*. \n \nAfter reconstitution with 2.2 mL water for injections (see section 6.6), each mL contains 5 mg of \nmetreleptin. \n \n*Metreleptin is a recombinant human leptin analogue (produced in Escherichia coli cells by \nrecombinant DNA technology to form recombinant methionyl-human leptin). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for injection (powder for injection).  \n \nWhite lyophilised cake or powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMyalepta is indicated as an adjunct to diet as a replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin \ndeficiency in lipodystrophy (LD) patients: \n• with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised \n\nLD (Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above \n• with confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in \n\nadults and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to \nachieve adequate metabolic control. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and monitored by a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis \nand management of metabolic disorders.  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended daily dose of metreleptin is based on body weight as provided in Table 1. \n \nIn order to ensure patients and carers understand the correct dose to be injected, the prescriber should \nprescribe the appropriate dose both in milligrams and the volume in millilitres. In order to avoid \nmedication errors including overdose, dose calculation and dose adjustment guidelines below should \nbe followed. A review of the patient’s self-administration technique is recommended every 6 months \nwhilst using Myalepta. \n \nActual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating the dose. \n \nTable 1 Metreleptin recommended dose \n\nBaseline weight Starting daily dose (injection volume) \nDose adjustments \n(injection volume) \n\nMaximum daily dose \n(injection volume) \n\nMales and females ≤ 40 kg 0.06 mg/kg \n(0.012 mL/kg) \n\n0.02 mg/kg \n(0.004 mL/kg) \n\n0.13 mg/kg \n(0.026 mL/kg) \n\nMales > 40 kg 2.5 mg \n(0.5 mL) \n\n1.25 mg (0.25 mL) to \n2.5 mg (0.5 mL) \n\n10 mg \n(2 mL) \n\nFemales > 40 kg 5 mg \n(1 mL) \n\n1.25 mg (0.25 mL) to \n2.5 mg (0.5 mL) \n\n10 mg \n(2 mL) \n\n \nDose adjustments \n \nBased on clinical response (e.g. inadequate metabolic control) or other consideration (e.g. tolerability \nissues, excessive weight loss especially in paediatric patients), the dose may be decreased, or increased \nto the maximum dose listed in Table 1. The maximum tolerated dose may be less than the maximum \ndaily dose, outlined in Table 1, as evidenced by excessive weight loss, even if metabolic response is \nincomplete. \n \nA minimum clinical response is defined as at least: \n• 0.5% HbA1c reduction and/or 25% reduction in insulin requirements \n\nand / or  \n• 15% reduction in triglycerides (TGs) \n \nIf clinical response is not seen after 6 months of treatment the physician should ensure that the patient \nis compliant with the administration technique, is receiving the correct dose and is adherent to diet. \nConsider dose increase before stopping treatment. \nMetreleptin dose increases in adults and children based on incomplete clinical response can be \nconsidered after a minimum of 6 months of treatment, allowing for lowering concomitant insulin, oral \nanti-diabetic and/or lipid lowering medication. \n \nReductions in HbA1c and TG may not be seen in children as metabolic abnormalities may not be \npresent at the start of treatment. It is anticipated that most children will require increasing per kg dose, \nespecially as they reach puberty. Increasing abnormalities of TG and HbA1c may be seen which may \nrequire a dose increase. Dose adjustments in children without metabolic abnormalities should \nprimarily be made according to weight change. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nDose increases should not be made more frequently than every 4 weeks. Dose decreases based on \nweight loss may be made weekly. \n \nThere is a risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with Myalepta who are on anti-diabetic therapy. \nLarge dose reductions of 50% or more of baseline insulin requirements may be needed in the initial \nphases of treatment. Once insulin requirements have stabilised, dose adjustments of other anti-diabetic \ntherapies may also be needed in some patients to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4 \nand 4.8). \n \nDiscontinuation in patients at risk for pancreatitis \n \nWhen discontinuing Myalepta in patients with risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g. history of pancreatitis, \nsevere hypertriglyceridaemia), tapering of the dose over a two-week period is recommended in \nconjunction with a low-fat diet. During tapering, monitor triglyceride levels and consider initiating or \nadjusting the dose of lipid-lowering medicinal products as needed. Signs and/or symptoms consistent \nwith pancreatitis should prompt an appropriate clinical evaluation (see section 4.4). \n \nMissed dose \n \nIf a patient misses a dose, the dose should be administered as soon as the omission is noticed and the \nnormal dosing schedule resumed the next day. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nClinical trials of metreleptin did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to \ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection and \nmodification for an elderly patient should be cautious, although no specific dose adjustment is \nrecommended. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \n \nMetreleptin has not been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. No dose \nrecommendations can be made. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of metreleptin in children aged 0 to 2 years with generalised LD and children \naged 0 to 12 years with partial LD has not been established. Very limited data are available for \nchildren, especially less than 6 years, with generalised LD. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nSubcutaneous use. \n \nHealthcare professionals should provide patients and carers with training on the reconstitution of the \nproduct and proper subcutaneous injection technique, so as to avoid intramuscular injection in patients \nwith minimal subcutaneous adipose tissue. \n \nPatients and/or carers should prepare and administer the first dose of the medicinal product under the \nsupervision of a qualified healthcare professional. \n \nThe injection should be administered at the same time every day. It can be administered any time of \nthe day without regard to the timing of meals. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe reconstituted solution should be injected into the abdomen, thigh or upper arm tissue. It is \nrecommended that patients should use a different injection site each day when injecting in the same \nregion. Doses exceeding 1 mL can be administered as two injections (the total daily dose divided \nequally) to minimise potential injection site discomfort due to injection volume. When dividing doses \ndue to volume, doses can be administered one after the other at different injection sites. \n \nWhen small doses/volumes are prescribed (e.g. in children), the vials will remain almost completely \nfilled with product after withdrawal of the required dose. Remaining reconstituted product should be \ndiscarded after use. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe information intended for patients in the package leaflet (section 7). \n \nTable 2 Dose calculation \nWeight and gender  Starting dose calculation \nFor males and females \n≤ 40 kg once daily dose \n\nWeight (kg) x 0.06 mg/kg = Individual patient daily starting dose in mg \nWeight (kg) x 0.012 mL/kg = Individual patient daily starting volume to inject \nin mL \n \nExample: \n25 kg patient is initiated at 0.06 mg/kg of Myalepta.

The \nindividual patient dose = 0.9 mg. A dose increment of 0.02 mg/kg increases \nthe daily dose to 0.08 mg/kg = 1.2 mg. Total daily volume to be injected is \ntotal dose in mg/5, in this case it is 1.2 mg/5 = 0.24 mL which equals 24 units \non the 0.3 mL insulin syringe. \n \n\nBoth males and \nfemales > 40 kg \n\nFor all patients weighing more than 40 kg an incremental adjustment increase \nin daily dose would be 1.25 mg or 0.25 mL injection volume.  \n \nTotal daily volume to be injected is total dose in mg/5. \n \nExample: A male patient is initiated at 2.5 mg of Myalepta daily. A dose \nincrement of 1.25 mg increases the daily dose to 3.75 mg. \nTotal daily volume to be injected is 3.75 mg/5 = 0.75 mL. \n \nThe maximum daily dose in males and females is 10 mg or 2 mL injection \nvolume \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nData from clinical trials do not support safety and efficacy in patients with HIV-related LD. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nThere have been reports of generalised hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria or generalised rash) \nin patients using Myalepta. Anaphylactic reactions may follow immediately after administration of the \nmedicine. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration should \nbe permanently discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n \nAcute pancreatitis associated with discontinuation of Myalepta \n \nNon-compliance with, or abrupt discontinuation of, Myalepta may result in worsening \nhypertriglyceridaemia and associated pancreatitis, particularly in patients with risk factors for \npancreatitis (e.g. history of pancreatitis, severe hypertriglyceridaemia) (see section 4.8). If a patient \ndevelops pancreatitis whilst being treated with metreleptin, it is advised that metreleptin be continued \nuninterrupted, as stopping treatment abruptly may exacerbate the condition. If metreleptin must be \nstopped for any reason, tapering of the dose over a two-week period is recommended in conjunction \nwith a low fat diet, see section 4.2. During tapering, monitor triglyceride levels and consider initiating \nor adjusting the dose of lipid-lowering medicinal products as needed. Signs and/or symptoms \nconsistent with pancreatitis should prompt an appropriate clinical evaluation. \n \nHypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and other anti-diabetics \n \nThere is a risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with Myalepta who are on anti-diabetic medicinal \nproducts, in particular insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulphonylureas). Large dose reductions of \n50% or more of baseline insulin requirements may be needed in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Once \n\n\n\n8 \n\ninsulin requirements have stabilised, dose adjustments of other anti-diabetics may also be needed in \nsome patients to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. \n \nClosely monitor blood glucose in patients on concomitant insulin therapy, especially those on high \ndoses, or insulin secretagogues and combination treatment. Patients and carers should be advised to be \naware of the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nIn clinical studies, hypoglycaemia has been managed with food/drink intake and by modifying the \ndose of anti-diabetic medicinal product. In case of hypoglycaemic events of a non-severe nature, food \nintake management may be considered as an alternative to dose-adjustment of anti-diabetics according \nto the treating physician’s opinion. \n \nRotation of injection sites is recommended in patients co-administering insulin (or other subcutaneous \nmedicinal products) and Myalepta. \n \nT-cell lymphoma \n \nCases of T-cell lymphoma (see section 4.8) have been reported while using Myalepta in clinical \nstudies. A causal relationship between the medicinal product treatment and the development and/or \nprogression of lymphoma has not been established. \n \nThe benefits and risks of treatment should be carefully considered in patients with acquired \ngeneralised LD and/or in patients with significant haematological abnormalities (including leukopenia, \nneutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma, and/or lymphadenopathy). \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn clinical trials, antidrug antibodies (ADA) to metreleptin occurred very commonly (88%) in patients. \nA blocking activity of the reaction between metreleptin and a recombinant leptin receptor has been \nobserved in vitro in the blood of the majority of patients but the impact on the efficacy of metreleptin \ncould not be clearly established (see section 4.8). \n \nIn patients with serious and severe infections, continuation of metreleptin should be at the discretion of \nthe prescriber. An association between the development of a blocking activity against metreleptin and \nserious and severe infections cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nThough not confirmed in clinical trials, neutralising antibodies could in theory affect the activity of \nendogenous leptin. \n \nPregnancy \n \nUnplanned pregnancies may occur due to restoration of luteinizing hormone (LH) release, see section \n4.6. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n“sodium free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n \nLeptin is a cytokine and has the potential to alter the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) \nenzymes. Since it cannot be excluded that metreleptin may reduce exposure to substrates of CYP3A \nthrough enzyme induction, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-administered \nwith metreleptin. Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should be considered \n\n\n\n9 \n\nduring treatment. The effect of metreleptin on CYP450 enzymes may be clinically relevant for \nCYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon \ninitiation or discontinuation of metreleptin, in patients being treated with these types of agents, \ntherapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin), or drug concentrations (e.g. cyclosporin or \ntheophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the agent adjusted as needed. When \nstarting therapy with Myalepta there is a risk of hypoglycaemia in patients who are on anti-diabetic \nmedicinal products, in particular insulin or insulin secretagogues (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nMyalepta is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. Abortions, stillbirths and preterm deliveries have been reported in women exposed to \nmetreleptin during pregnancy, though there is currently no evidence to suggest a causal relationship \nwith the treatment. Studies in animals have shown some evidence of reproductive toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether metreleptin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Endogenous leptin is \npresent in human milk. \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nMyalepta therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are data to suggest metreleptin may increase fertility, due to effects on LH, with the consequent \npotential for unplanned pregnancy (see section 4.4). \n \nAnimal studies showed no adverse effects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMyalepta has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to fatigue and dizziness. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nA total of 148 patients with generalised and partial LD received metreleptin during clinical studies.  \n \nSafety and efficacy data were analysed in a subgroup of partial LD patients with the following \ncharacteristics: 12 years of age and above with leptin levels < 12 ng/mL, TG ≥ 5.65 mmol/l and/or \nHbA1c ≥ 8%. \n \nThe adverse reactions reported in generalised LD and this subgroup of partial LD patients are listed in \nTable 7. Additionally, adverse reactions from post-marketing sources are also presented. The most \nfrequently occurring adverse reactions from the clinical studies were hypoglycaemia (14%) and weight \ndecreased (17%). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are classified by MedDRA System Organ Class and absolute frequency in Table 7. \nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 \nto < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom available data). Due to the number of patients with generalised and partial LD treated in clinical \ntrials, it is not possible to detect with certainty, events which occur at a frequency of < 1%. \n \nTable 7 Adverse reactions reported with Myalepta in > 1 patient during clinical studies in \ngeneralised LD and the subgroup of partial LD patients and post-marketing experience \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common Common Frequency not known* \nInfections and infestations     Influenza, Pneumonia  \nImmune system disorders     Anaphylactic reaction \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Hypoglycaemia Decreased appetite Diabetes mellitus, \n\nHyperphagia, Insulin \nresistance  \n\nNervous system disorders  Headache  \nCardiac disorders     Tachycardia \nVascular disorders     Deep vein thrombosis \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n    Cough, Dyspnoea \nPleural effusion \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   Abdominal pain, \nNausea \n\nAbdominal pain \nupper, Diarrhoea, \nPancreatitis, \nVomiting \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n  Alopecia Pruritus, Rash, \nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\n    Arthralgia, Myalgia \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\n  Menorrhagia   \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\n  Fatigue, Injection \nsite bruising, \nInjection site \nerythema, Injection \nsite reaction \n\nFat tissue increased, \nInjection site \nhaemorrhage, \nInjection site pain, \nInjection site pruritus, \nInjection site \nswelling, Malaise, \nPeripheral swelling \n\nInvestigations Weight \ndecreased \n\nNeutralising \nantibodies \n\nBlood glucose \nabnormal, Blood \ntriglycerides \nincreased, Drug \nspecific antibody \npresent, Glycosylated \nhaemoglobin \nincreased, Weight \nincreased \n\n*Global post marketing experience  \n \nAcute pancreatitis associated with discontinuation of metreleptin \n \nIn clinical studies, 6 patients (4 with generalised LD and 2 with partial LD), experienced \ntreatment-emergent pancreatitis. All patients had a history of pancreatitis and hypertriglyceridaemia. \nAbrupt interruption and/or non-compliance with metreleptin dosing was suspected to have contributed \n\n\n\n11 \n\nto the occurrence of pancreatitis in 2 patients. The mechanism for pancreatitis in these patients was \npresumed to be return of hypertriglyceridaemia and therefore increased risk of pancreatitis in the \nsetting of discontinuation of effective therapy for hypertriglyceridaemia. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nMetreleptin may decrease insulin resistance in diabetic patients, resulting in hypoglycaemia in patients \nwith LD and co-existing diabetes. Hypoglycaemia, deemed as related to metreleptin treatment, \noccurred in 14.2% of patients studied. All reports of hypoglycaemia in patients with generalised LD \nand in the subgroup of partial LD patients, have been mild in nature with no pattern of onset or clinical \nsequelae. Generally the majority of events could be managed by food intake with only relatively few \nmodifications of anti-diabetic medicinal product dose occurring. \n \nT-cell lymphoma \n \nThree cases of T-cell lymphoma have been reported while using metreleptin in clinical studies. All \nthree patients had acquired generalised LD. Two of these patients were diagnosed with peripheral \nT-cell lymphoma while receiving the medicinal product. Both had immunodeficiency and significant \nhaematological abnormalities including severe bone marrow abnormalities before the start of \ntreatment. A separate case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma was reported in a paediatric patient \nreceiving the medicinal product who did not have haematological abnormalities before treatment. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn clinical trials (Studies NIH 991265/20010769 and FHA101), the rate of ADAs for generalised LD \nand the partial LD patients studied and with data available were 88% (65 out of 74 patients). A \nblocking activity of the reaction between metreleptin and a recombinant leptin receptor has been \nobserved in vitro in the blood of the majority of an extended set of patients (98 out of 102 patients or \n96%) but the impact on the efficacy of metreleptin could not be clearly established. \nSerious and/or severe infections that were temporally associated with > 80% blocking activity against \nmetreleptin occurred in 5 generalised LD patients. These events included 1 episode in 1 patient of \nserious and severe appendicitis, 2 episodes in patients of serious and severe pneumonia, a single \nepisode of serious and severe sepsis and non-serious severe gingivitis in 1 patient and 6 episodes of \nserious and severe sepsis or bacteraemia and 1 episode of non-serious severe ear infection in 1 patient. \nOne serious and severe infection of appendicitis was temporally associated with blocking activity \nagainst metreleptin in a patient with partial LD who was not in the subgroup of partial LD patients. \nThough temporally associated, it is not possible to unequivocally confirm or deny a direct relation to \nmetreleptin treatment based on the currently available body of evidence. LD patients with a blocking \nactivity against metreleptin and concurrent infections responded to standard of care treatment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site reactions were reported in 3.4% of patients with LD treated with metreleptin. All events \nreported in clinical studies in patients with LD have been mild or moderate in severity and none have \nled to treatment discontinuation. Most events occurred during the initial 1-2 months of initiation of \ntreatment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAcross two completed clinical studies (NIH 991265/20010769 and FHA101), there were 52 paediatric \npatients (4 in the subgroup of partial LD patients and 48 with generalised LD) enrolled and exposed to \nmetreleptin. Limited clinical data exists in children less than 2 years old for generalised LD patients \nand less than 12 years old in partial LD patients. \n \nOverall, the safety and tolerability of metreleptin are similar in children and adults. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn generalised LD patients, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar regardless of age. \nSerious adverse reactions were reported in 2 patients, worsening hypertension and anaplastic large cell \nlymphoma. \n \nIn partial LD patients, assessment across age groups is limited, due to the small sample size. No \nadverse reactions were reported in paediatric patients in the subgroup of partial LD patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn one post-marketing case, an infant was exposed to a 10-fold overdose of metreleptin for 8 months. \nIn this case, prolonged overdose was associated with severe anorexia causing vitamin and zinc \ndeficiencies, iron deficiency anaemia, protein calorie malnutrition, and poor weight gain, which \nresolved following supportive treatment and dose adjustment. \n \nIn case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions \nand supportive treatment initiated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, amino acids and \nderivatives, ATC code: A16AA07 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nMetreleptin mimics the physiological effects of leptin by binding to and activating the human leptin \nreceptor, which belongs to the Class I cytokine family of receptors that signals through the JAK/STAT \ntransduction pathway. \n \nOnly the metabolic effects of metreleptin have been studied. No effects on the distribution of \nsubcutaneous fat are expected. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy and safety of treatment with metreleptin was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study \n(Study NIH 991265/20010769) in patients with congenital or acquired generalised LD or familial or \nacquired partial LD. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were > 6 months old, with a leptin \nlevel of < 12 ng/mL, and had at least 1 of the following 3 metabolic abnormalities: \n● Presence of diabetes mellitus, or  \n● Fasting insulin concentration > 30 μU/mL, or  \n● Fasting TG concentration > 2.26 mmol/L or postprandially elevated triglycerides \n\n> 5.65 mmol/L \n \nThe co-primary efficacy endpoints in this study were defined as: \n● Actual change from baseline in HbA1c at Month 12, and \n● Percent change from baseline in fasting serum TGs at Month 12 \n \nStudy NIH 991265/20010769 was conducted over 14 years, with the primary efficacy assessments \nbeing made in both generalised LD and partial LD patients after 12 months of treatment. Multiple \n\n\n\n13 \n\ndosing regimens were explored during the NIH study, which led to the posology recommended in \nsection 4.2. \n \nConcomitant anti-diabetic and lipid-lowering dose regimens were not held constant during the study, \nbut analyses showed no significant difference in efficacy between patients who had no increases or \nadditions to their anti-diabetic or lipid-lowering treatments versus the overall study population. \n \nGeneralised LD \n \nOf the 66 generalised LD patients enrolled, 45 (68%) had congenital generalised LD and 21 (32%) had \nacquired generalised LD. Overall, 51 (77%) patients were female, 31 (47%) were Caucasian, 11 (17%) \nHispanic, and 16 (24%) Black. The median age at baseline was 15 years (range: 1–68 years), with 45 \n(68%) patients being less than 18 years of age. The median fasting leptin concentration at baseline was \n1.0 ng/mL in males (range: 0.3–3.3 ng/mL) and 1.1 ng/mL in females (range: 0.2-5.3 ng/mL) using the \nLINCO RIA test method. \n \nThe median duration of metreleptin treatment was 4.2 years (range: 3.4 months–13.8 years). The \nmedicinal product was administered subcutaneously either once daily or twice daily (in two equal \ndoses). The weighted average daily dose (i.e., the average dose taking into account duration of \ntreatment at different doses) for the 48 patients with baseline body weight greater than 40 kg was \n2.6 mg for males and 5.2 mg for females during the first year of treatment, and 3.7 mg for males and \n6.5 mg for females over the entire study period. For the 18 patients with baseline body weight less \nthan or equal to 40 kg, the weighted average daily dose was 2.0 mg for males and 2.3 mg for females \nin the first year of treatment, and 2.5 mg for males and 3.2 mg for females over the entire study period. \n \nTable 8 Primary outcome results in an open-label, single-arm study (NIH 991265/20010769) in \nevaluable patients with generalised LD treated with metreleptin at 12 months \nParameter n Baseline Change from Baseline at Month 12 \n\nHbA1c (%) 59   \n\nMean (SD)  8.6 (2.33) -2.2 (2.15) \n\nP   < 0.001 \n\nFasting TGs (mmol/L) 58   \n\nMean (SD)  14.7 (25.6) -32.1% (71.28) \n\nP   0.001 \n\nSD = standard deviation \n \nAmong 45 patients with generalised LD who had a baseline HbA1c of 7% or greater and data available \nat Month 12, the mean (SD) baseline HbA1c was 9.6% (1.63) and the mean reduction in HbA1c at \nMonth 12 was 2.8%. Among 24 patients with generalised LD who had a baseline TG level \n5.65 mmol/l or greater and data available at Month 12, the mean (SD) baseline TG level was \n31.7 mmol/l (33.68) and the mean percent reduction in triglycerides at Month 12 was 72%. \n \nAmong the 39 patients with generalised LD who were receiving insulin at baseline, 16 (41%) were \nable to discontinue insulin use altogether after starting metreleptin. Most of these patients (13 of 16) \nwere able to stop insulin use within the first year of metreleptin. For the 32 patients with generalised \nLD who were receiving oral anti-diabetic medicinal products at baseline, 7 (22%) were able to \ndiscontinue their use. A total of 8 (24%) of the 34 patients with generalised LD who were receiving \nlipid-lowering therapies at baseline discontinued their use during metreleptin treatment. \n \nThere was evidence of improvement in renal and hepatic function in patients with generalised LD \ntreated with metreleptin. In 24 patients with renal data available, the mean change at Month 12 in \n\n\n\n14 \n\nprotein excretion rate versus baseline (1,675.7 mg/24hr) was -906.1 mg/24 hr. In 43 patients with \nhepatic data available, the mean changes at Month 12 in alanine aminotransferase, versus baseline \n(112.5 U/L) was -53.1 U/L, and aspartate aminotransferase versus baseline (75.3 U/L) was -23.8 U/L. \n \nPartial LD subgroup \n \nA subgroup of partial LD patients is analysed for whom TG ≥ 5.65 mmol/l and/or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% at \nbaseline. Of the 31 partial LD subgroup patients evaluated, 27 (87%) had familial partial LD and 4 \n(13%) had acquired partial LD. Overall, 30 (97%) patients were female, 26 (84%) were Caucasian, 2 \n(7%) Hispanic, and 0 Black. The median age at baseline was 38 years (range: 15-64 years), with 5 \n(16%) patients being less than 18 years of age. The median fasting leptin concentration at baseline was \n5.9 ng/mL (1.6-16.9) using the LINCO RIA test method. \n \nThe median duration of metreleptin treatment was 2.4 years (range: 6.7 months-14.0 years). The \nmedicinal product was administered subcutaneously either once daily or twice daily (in two equal \ndoses). The weighted average daily dose (i.e., the average dose taking into account duration of \ntreatment at different doses) for all 31 patients with baseline body weight greater than 40 kg was \n7.0 mg during the first year of treatment, and 8.4 mg over the entire study period. \n \nTable 9 Primary outcome results in study (NIH 991265/ 20010769) of evaluable patients in the \npartial LD subgroup treated with metreleptin at 12 months \n\nParameter n Baseline Change from Baseline at Month 12 \n\nHbA1c (%) 27   \n\nMean (SD)  8.8 (1.91) -0.9 (1.23) \n\nP   < 0.001 \n\nFasting Triglycerides (mmol/L) 27   \n\nMean (SD)  15.7 (26.42) -37.4% (30.81) \n\nP   < 0.001 \n\nSD = standard deviation \n \nAmong 15 patients in the partial LD subgroup who had a baseline TG level 5.65 mmol/L or greater \nand data available at Month 12, the mean (SD) baseline triglyceride level was 27.6 mmol/L (32.88) \nand the mean percent reduction in TGs at Month 12 was 53.7%. \n \nAmong 18 patients in the partial LD subgroup who had a baseline HbA1c level 8% or greater and data \navailable at Month 12, the mean (SD) baseline HbA1c level was 9.9% (1.59) and the mean reduction \nin HbA1c at Month 12 was 1.3%. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn the generalised LD group, the number of patients according to age group was as follows: 5 patients \n< 6 years (including a single patient < 2 years), 12 patients ≥ 6 to < 12 years and 28 patients aged ≥ 12 \nto < 18 years; in the partial LD subgroup, there were no patients < 12 years of age and 4 patients ≥ 12 \nto < 18 years. \n \nIn the generalised LD group, mean decreases from baseline in HbA1c were noted in all age groups \n≥ 6 years; the mean decreases to Month 12/last observation carried forward LOCF were similar in the \ntwo older age groups (-1.1% and -2.6%). Mean change among the 5 patients < 6 years of age was \n0.2%. These differences across age groups are likely related to differences in mean HbA1c at baseline, \nwhich was in the normal range for patients < 6 years (5.7%) and lower in patients ≥ 6 to < 12 years \n(6.4%) compared to the older age group (9.7%). Mean decreases from baseline to Month 12/LOCF in \n\n\n\n15 \n\nTGs for the generalised LD group were noted in all age groups with larger mean changes observed in \nthe older age group (-42.9%) compared to the younger age groups (-10.5% and -14.1%).  \n \nAmong the 4 patients in the partial LD subgroup between 12 and 18 years of age, mean change to \nMonth 12/LOCF for HbA1c was -0.7% and for TGs was -55.1%.  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nMyalepta in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of lipodystrophy (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’. This means that due to \n\nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThere are limited data on the pharmacokinetics of metreleptin in patients with lipodystrophy and \ntherefore no formal exposure-response analysis has been performed.  \n \nAbsorption \n \nPeak serum leptin (endogenous leptin and metreleptin) concentration (Cmax) occurred approximately \n4.0 hours after subcutaneous administration of single doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg in healthy \nadult subjects. In a supportive trial in LD patients, the median Tmax was 4 hours (range: 2 to 6 hours; \nN = 5) following single-dose administration of metreleptin. \n \nDistribution \n \nIn studies of healthy adult subjects, following intravenous administration of metreleptin, leptin volume \nof distribution (endogenous leptin and metreleptin) was approximately 4 to 5 times plasma volume; \nvolumes (mean ± SD) were 370 ± 184 mL/kg, 398 ± 92 mL/kg, and 463 ± 116 mL/kg for 0.3, 1.0, and \n3.0 mg/kg/day doses, respectively. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNo formal metabolism studies have been conducted. \n \nElimination \n \nNon-clinical data indicate renal clearance is the major route of metreleptin elimination, with no \napparent contribution of systemic metabolism or degradation. Following single subcutaneous doses of \n0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg metreleptin in healthy adult subjects, the half-life was 3.8 to 4.7 hours. After IV \nadministration, metreleptin clearance was shown to be 79.6 mL/kg/h in healthy volunteers. The \nclearance of metreleptin appears to be delayed in the presence of ADAs. A higher accumulation is \nobserved with higher ADA levels. Dose adjustments should be made based on clinical response (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nHepatic Impairment \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nRenal Impairment \n \nNo formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in patients with renal impairment. Non-clinical \ndata indicate renal clearance is the major route of metreleptin elimination, with no apparent \ncontribution of systemic metabolism or degradation. Hence, the pharmacokinetics may be altered in \npatients with renal impairment. \n \nAge, Gender, Race, Body Mass Index \n \nSpecific clinical studies have not been conducted to assess the effect of age, gender, race, or body \nmass index on the pharmacokinetics of metreleptin in patients with lipodystrophy. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and \ngenotoxicity reveal no risks additional to those attributed to an excess of the expected \npharmacodynamic responses, such as loss of appetite and body weight. \n \nTwo-year carcinogenicity studies in rodents have not been conducted. Metreleptin exhibits no \ngenotoxic potential and no proliferative or preneoplastic lesions were observed in mice or dogs \nfollowing treatment up to 6 months. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies conducted in mice have revealed no adverse effects on mating, fertility \nor embryo-foetal development up to the maximum tested dose, approximately, 15-fold the maximum \nrecommended clinical dose, based on body surface area of a 60 kg patient. \n  \nIn a pre- and postnatal development study in mice, metreleptin caused prolonged gestation and \ndystocia at all tested doses, starting at, approximately, a dose identical to the maximum recommended \nclinical dose, based on body surface area of a 60 kg patient. Prolonged gestation resulted in the death \nof some females during parturition and lower survival of offspring within the immediate postnatal \nperiod. These findings are considered to be related indirectly to metreleptin pharmacology, resulting in \nnutritional deprivation of treated animals, and also possibly, due to an inhibitory effect on spontaneous \nand oxytocin-induced contractions, as has been observed in strips of human myometrium exposed to \nleptin. Decreased maternal body weight was observed from gestation throughout lactation at all doses \nand resulted in reduced weight of offspring at birth, which persisted into adulthood. However, no \ndevelopmental abnormalities were observed and reproductive performance of the first or second \ngenerations was not affected at any dose. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies have not included toxicokinetics analysis. However, separate studies \nrevealed that exposure of the mouse foetus to metreleptin was low (< 1%) after subcutaneous \nadministration of metreleptin to pregnant mice. The AUC exposure of pregnant mice was \napproximately 2 to 3 times greater than observed in non-pregnant mice after 10 mg/kg subcutaneous \nadministration of metreleptin. A 4 to 5-fold increase in the t1/2 values was also observed in pregnant \nmice compared to non-pregnant mice. The greater metreleptin exposure and longer t1/2 observed in the \npregnant animals may be related to a reduced elimination capacity by binding to soluble leptin \nreceptor found at higher levels in pregnant mice.  \n \nNo studies with direct administration of metreleptin to juvenile animals have been conducted. \nHowever, in published studies, leptin treatment of euleptinaemic prepubertal female mice has led to an \nearlier onset of puberty. \n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n6.

CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND \n\nEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n• Risk Management Plan (RMP) \n\n \nThe MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in \nthe agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed \nsubsequent updates of the RMP. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nAn updated RMP should be submitted: \n• At the request of the European Medicines Agency; \n• Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information \n\nbeing received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of \nan important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. \n\n \n• Additional risk minimisation measures \n \nPrior to launch of Myalepta in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must \nagree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, \ndistribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent \nAuthority.  \nThe educational programme is aimed at increasing awareness among healthcare professionals and \npatients/carers about the important risks contained in the Risk Management Plan. It is also aimed to \nguide prescribers about the appropriate management of these risks. \nThe MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Myalepta is marketed, all healthcare \nprofessionals and patients/carers who are expected to use Myalepta are provided with the following \neducational package: \n\n• Healthcare professionals educational material  \n• Patients/carers educational material  \n\nHealthcare professionals’ educational material should contain: \n• The Summary of Product Characteristics  \n• Guide for healthcare professionals \n• Healthcare professionals training material \n• A dose card on which the doctor can write for the patient the dose in mg, ml (and where \n\nappropriate units from a 0.3 ml U100 insulin syringe). This card will also include pictures of \nthe relevant syringe sizes on which the doctor can draw a line to indicate on the volume of \nwater for injection to use for reconstitution and the volume of reconstituted solution to inject. \n \nThe Guide/training material for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key \nelements: \no Reminders on key prescribing information content, including indicated population, \n\nposology, warnings and precautions, and other safety- related information which is key to \nsafe use of the product. This will include for example instructions for handling possible \nADRs. \n\no Responsibility of the prescribing physician to provide appropriate training to the \npatient/carer who will administer the treatment and that the first dose should be \nadministered in the presence of a doctor or nurse. \n\no The requirement to perform regular follow-ups with the patient/carer to ensure continued \ncorrect and compliant Myalepta reconstitution and treatment. \n\no Hypersensitivity has been reported with Myalepta use including anaphylaxis, urticaria and \ngeneralised rash. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, \nadministration of Myalepta should be permanently discontinued immediately and \nappropriate therapy initiated. \n\no Non-compliance with or abrupt withdrawal of Myalepta may result in worsening of \nhypertriglyceridaemia and associated pancreatitis: \n- Risk factors include patients with a history of pancreatitis or severe \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia. \n- Tapering the dose over a two-week period is recommended in conjunction with a low \n\nfat diet. \n- Patients should be monitored during tapering. Initiating or adjusting lipid lowering \n\nmedications may be required. \n- Signs and/or symptoms consistent with pancreatitis should prompt an appropriate \n\nclinical evaluation. \no Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and other antidiabetics may occur: \n\n\n\n23 \n\n- Large dose reductions of 50% or more of baseline insulin requirements may be needed \nin the first 2 weeks of Myalepta treatment. Once insulin requirements have stabilised, \ndose adjustments of other anti-diabetics may also be needed in some patients. \n\n- Monitoring of blood glucose in patients on concomitant insulin therapy, especially \nthose on high doses, or insulin secretagogues and combination treatment is warranted. \nPatients and carers should be advised to be aware of the signs and symptoms of \nhypoglycaemia. \n\n- In case of hypoglycaemic events of a non-severe nature, food intake management may \nbe considered as an alternative to dose adjustment of anti-diabetics. \n\n- Rotation of injection sites is recommended in patients co administering insulin (or \nother SC medicinal products) and Myalepta. \n\no Ways to prevent the occurrence of medication errors \n- Myalepta is administered by SC injection and proper technique should be used to \n\navoid intramuscular injection in patients with minimal SC tissue. \n- HCPs should provide training to patients on the correct technique. \n- Patients and/or caregivers should prepare and administer the first dose under the \n\nsupervision of a qualified HCP. \n- Detailed instructions for use. \n- Guidance in the educational materials on: \n\n▪ The size of syringes and needles to prescribe \n▪ Prescribing the dose in both mg and ml and, where a 0.3 mL U100 insulin syringe \n\nis used, informing patients on the dose in \"units\" on the syringe to inject \n▪ The prescribing of ampoule/vial sizes volumes of water for injection in appropriate \n\nvolumes to reduce the risk of re-use \nPharmacists will be guided in the educational materials on the ancillary items that need to \nbe dispensed to patients including appropriate sized reconstitution and administration \nsyringes and needles, appropriate sized vials/ampoules of water for injection, alcohol \nswabs and a sharps bin plus how to access Aegerion reconstitution and administration kits \ncontaining all of the above items except the water for injection and sharps bin. \n- Access to further materials, including training videos in multiple languages that will \n\ndemonstrate each step to in preparing and administering Myalepta via a website. \no T-cell lymphoma \n\n- Acquired LDs are associated with autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders are \nassociated with an increased risk of malignancies including lymphomas. \n\n- Lymphoproliferative disorders, including lymphoma have been reported in patients \nwith acquired generalised LD not treated with Myalepta. Cases of T-cell lymphoma \nhave been reported in clinical studies in patients taking Myalepta. A causal \nrelationship between lymphoma and Myalepta has not been established. \n\n- The benefits and risks of Myalepta should be carefully considered in patients with \nacquired LD and/or those with significant haematologic abnormalities (including \nleukopenia, neutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma and/or \nlymphadenopathy). An association between the development of Neutralising \nAntibodies (NAbs) and serious and severe infections cannot be excluded and the \ncontinuation of Myalepta should be at the discretion of the prescriber. \n\no Myalepta may increase fertility, due to effects on LH and thus the chances of unplanned \npregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should be advised that Myalepta may \nincrease fertility and should be encouraged to use contraception. \n\no Neutralising antibodies may develop on Myalepta therapy. An association between the \ndevelopment of neutralising antidrug antibodies and serious and severe infections cannot \nbe excluded, and, continuation of Myalepta should be at the discretion of the prescriber. \nConsideration should also be given by the prescriber to have patients tested for the \npresence of neutralising antibodies. \n\no Loss of efficacy, potentially due to neutralising antibodies, may occur in patients on \nMyalepta therapy. While the impact of neutralising antibodies on efficacy has not been \nconfirmed, consideration should be given by the prescriber to have patients tested for the \n\n\n\n24 \n\npresence of neutralising antibodies if there is significant loss of efficacy despite Myalepta \nadministration. \n\nPatients/carers educational material should contain: \n• The patient information leaflet \n• Guide for patients/carers  \n• Patients/carers training material \n\nThe Guide/training material for patients/carers shall contain the following key elements: \no Reminders on key prescribing information content, including indicated population, \n\nposology, warnings and precautions, and other safety- related information which is key to \nsafe use of the product. This will include for example instructions for handling possible \nADRs \n\no Allergic reactions can occur with Myalepta use. Advice will be provided on symptoms of \nan allergic reaction and action to be taken in the event of such a reaction. \n\no The need of compliance with treatment due to the risk of pancreatitis when medication is \nabruptly stopped. The importance of tapering the dose of Myalepta over two weeks if it is \nto be discontinued. \n\no Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and other antidiabetics may occur. \no The risk of medication error: \n\n- Responsibility of the prescribing physician to provide appropriate training to the \npatient/carer who will administer the treatment and that the first dose should be \nadministered in the presence of a doctor or nurse \n\n- The requirement to perform regular follow-ups with the patient/carer to ensure \ncontinued correct and compliant Myalepta reconstitution and treatment \n\n- Guidance on the appropriate syringe size ancillary administration set to prescribe \naccording to the dosage of Myalepta and how to read the syringe volumes \n\n- How to access a video on line which shows step by step how to reconstitute, measure \nthe correct dose and administer it subcutaneously \n\no The association between LD and lymphoma and that the patient will be monitored during \ntreatment. \n\no Serious and severe infections secondary to the appearance of NAb may occur. \no Myalepta may increase fertility, due to effects on LH and thus the chances of unplanned \n\npregnancy. \n \n \nE.

What Myalepta is and what it is used for \n \nMyalepta contains the active substance metreleptin. \n• Metreleptin is similar to a human hormone called leptin. \n \nWhat Myalepta is used for \nMyalepta is used to treat the complications of not having enough leptin in patients with lipodystrophy. \nIt is used in adults, adolescents and children 2 years or over: \n• who have generalised lipodystrophy (the whole of your body does not have enough fatty tissue)  \nIt is used, when other treatments have been ineffective, in adults, and adolescents 12 years or over: \n• who have partial lipodystrophy which is inherited (also called congenital or familial \n\nlipodystrophy)  \n• or partial lipodystrophy has been caused by your body’s response to something such as a viral \n\nillness (also called acquired lipodystrophy) \n \nHow Myalepta works \nNatural leptin is produced by fatty tissue and has many functions in the body including: \n• controlling how hungry you feel and your energy levels \n• helping the insulin in your body manage sugar levels. \nMetreleptin works by copying the effects of leptin. This improves the ability of the body to control \nenergy levels. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Myalepta \n \nDo not use Myalepta if: \n• you are allergic to metreleptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Myalepta if: \n• you are pregnant \n• you have ever had a type of cancer called lymphoma \n• you have ever had problems with your blood (such as a low blood count) \n• you have ever had inflammation of an organ called the pancreas (‘pancreatitis’) \n \nLymphoma \nPeople with lipodystrophy can get a type of blood cancer called lymphoma, whether or not they are \nusing Myalepta. \nHowever, you may be at higher risk of getting a lymphoma when using the medicinal product. \n• Your doctor will decide if you should use Myalepta and will monitor you during treatment. \n \nSerious and severe infections \nWhile being treated with Myalepta, your body might produce antibodies which may increase the risk \nof developing serious or severe infections. Tell your doctor straight-away if you develop a high \ntemperature, accompanied by increasing tiredness (see section 4). \n \nLow blood sugar with insulin or other anti-diabetic medicines \nIf you are using a medicine such as insulin or other medicines to treat diabetes, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your blood sugar. Your doctor will change your dose of insulin or other medicines if \nneeded. \nThis is to prevent your blood sugar from getting too low (‘hypo-glycaemia’). For signs of low blood \nsugar levels, see section 4 under ‘Signs of high and low blood sugar'. \n \nHigh blood sugar and fat levels \nYou may have higher amounts of sugar (‘hyper-glycaemia’) or fat (‘hyper-triglyceridaemia’) in your \nblood while on Myalepta, which may be a sign that this medicine is not working as well as it should. \nSigns of high blood sugar levels and high fat levels are listed in section 4 under “Signs of high and low \nblood sugar” and “Signs of high fat”. \nIf you notice any of the symptoms referred to above and described further in section 4 of this leaflet, \nor you are not sure, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor might need to change your \ntreatment. \n \nAllergic reactions \nWhile being treated with Myalepta, you may get an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor straight-away if \nyou have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction can be seen in section 4 \nunder “Allergic reactions”. \n \nFertility \nMyalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy (see section “Pregnancy, \nbreast-feeding and fertility”). \n \nHow to stop using Myalepta  \nIf you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks before \nstopping it altogether. Your doctor will also ask you to follow a reduced fat diet. \n\n• It is important to gradually reduce the dose over two weeks because this can help prevent a \nsudden increase in the levels of fat (called ‘triglycerides’) in your blood. \n\n• A sudden increase in the amount of triglyceride in your blood can make your pancreas \ninflamed (‘pancreatitis’). Gradually reducing your dose, and following a reduced fat diet may \n\nhelp to prevent this. \nYou should not stop using Myalepta unless your doctor tells you to. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years with generalised lipodystrophy, or \nbelow the age of 12 years with partial lipodystrophy. This is because it is not known how this \nmedicine will affect children under these ages. \n \nOther medicines and Myalepta \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Myalepta can \naffect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way this \nmedicine works. \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n• statins for reducing cholesterol (such as atorvastatin) \n• blood pressure medicines called ‘calcium channel blockers’ \n• theophylline used in lung problems such as asthma \n• blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin or phenprocoumon) \n• medicines for epilepsy or fits (such as phenytoin) \n• medicines which suppress the immune system (such as cyclosporine) \n• medicines for sleep or anxiety called ‘benzodiazepines’ \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before using Myalepta. Some \nmedicines need to be monitored while you are using Myalepta since the dose of these medicines might \nneed to be changed. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nYou should not use Myalepta if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it is not \nknown how metreleptin will affect your unborn baby. \n• Women who could get pregnant should use effective contraception, including non-hormonal \n\nmethods such as condoms, while using Myalepta.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You and your doctor will decide whether or not to \ncontinue breast-feeding while using this medicine. \nIt is not known if metreleptin will pass into breast milk.  \nMyalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMyalepta has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You might feel dizzy or tired \nwhen using this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. Talk to your \ndoctor if you are not sure.  \n \n \n3. How to use Myalepta \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nMyalepta is an injection once a day under the skin (‘subcutaneous injection’). This medicine is for use \nin children aged 2 years and above, adolescents and adults with generalised lipodystrophy; it is also for \nuse in children aged 12 years and above, adolescents and adults with partial lipodystrophy.  \nWhile using this medicine, you or your child will be monitored by your doctor, who will decide the \ndose you or your child should use. \n \nYour doctor may decide that you inject yourself. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how \nto prepare and inject this medicine. \n• Do not try to prepare the medicine or inject yourself if you have not been trained. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nHow much to inject \nYour dose of Myalepta may change over time depending on how this medicine works for you. The \nMyalepta powder is dissolved by mixing it with water for injections to make the solution for injecting. \nRead the “Instructions for Use” (see section 7) for how to make the solution before injecting. \nYour doctor will have prescribed the correct dose for you, based on the following: \n• If you weigh 40 kg or less: \n\n− A starting dose is 0.06 mg (0.012 mL of solution) for each kilogram of body weight. \n• If you are male and weigh more than 40 kg: \n\n− A starting dose is 2.5 mg (0.5 mL of solution). \n• If you are female and weigh more than 40 kg: \n\n− A starting dose is 5 mg (1 mL of solution). \nYour doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much of the solution to inject. If you are not sure how \nmuch of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before injecting. \n• The syringe you need to use to inject this medicine depends on the dose prescribed for you. \n\no Your pharmacist will give you the correct syringe for injecting. \no See the “Instructions for Use” to find out which syringe to use. \n\n• To know how much medicine to inject (in mL), you divide your dose (in mg) by 5. \no For example, if you have been prescribed a 5 mg dose of Myalepta, 5 mg divided by 5 gives \n\nyou 1 mL which is the amount you need to inject of the solution, using a 1 mL syringe. \n• If your dose is 1.50 mg (0.30 mL of solution) or less, you will need to use a 0.3 mL syringe. \n\no The 0.3 mL syringe will show the injection amount in ‘Unit’ instead of ‘mL’. See the \n“Instructions for Use” (section 7) for more information on reading and using the different \n\nsyringes. \no To know how much solution to inject (in Units), divide your dose (in mg) by 5, and then times \n\nit by 100. \nIf you need to inject 1 mL or more of Myalepta solution, your doctor might tell you to give the dose as \ntwo separate injections. This can help make the injections more comfortable. \nYou must use a clean syringe and needle for both injections. \nIf you are not sure how much of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \ninjecting. \nWhen small doses/volumes are prescribed (e.g. in children), the vials will remain almost completely \nfilled with product after withdrawal of the required dose. Remaining solution should be discarded after \nuse. \n \nIf you use more Myalepta than you should \nIf you use more Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Your \ndoctor will monitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you forget to use Myalepta \n• If you forget to inject a dose, inject it as soon as you remember. \n• Then have your normal dose the next day. \n• Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nIf you have injected less Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor will \nmonitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you stop using Myalepta \nDo not stop using Myalepta without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will decide if you should stop \nusing this medicine. \n \nIf you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks. See \nsection 2 “How to stop using Myalepta” for more information. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n42 \n\n4.

These will have been given to you by \nyour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. \n \nOn a clean, well-lit work surface, place the following items: \n• a glass vial of Myalepta powder \n• a container of water for injections for dissolving the Myalepta powder \n\no The water for injections might come in glass or plastic ampoules, or glass vials with a rubber \nstopper. \n\n• alcohol wipes (to clean your skin where you will inject and to clean the tops of the vials) \n• sharps disposal container (to safely dispose of the injection equipment afterwards) \n \nYou will also need 2 syringes: \n• One 1 mL syringe with a 21 gauge, 40 mm needle for dissolving the powder \n• One injection syringe with a much shorter needle for injecting the solution under your skin  \n\nThe size of this syringe will be chosen by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for your dose of \nMyalepta. \no If your dose is 1.5 mg or less, you will use a 0.3 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 1.5 mg up to 5 mg, you will use a 1 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 5 mg, you will use a 2.5 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 5 mg, your doctor, nurse or pharmacist might tell you to give the \n\ndose as two separate injections. See section 3 “How much to inject” for more information. \n \n\n \n \n2) Before preparing Myalepta solution, allow the powder vial to reach room temperature for about \n10 minutes. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n \n3) Wash your hands before preparing the medicine. \n \nStep B: Filling the 1 mL syringe with 0.6 mL of water for injections \n \n4) Take the 1 mL syringe out of the plastic wrapper. Always use a new syringe. \n\n• The 1 mL syringe and needle will be provided separately. \n• How you connect the needle to the syringe will be depend on if you have been provided your \n\nwater for injection in a plastic ampoule, a glass ampoule, or a glass vial (see below for specific \ninstructions). \n \n\n5) Withdraw 0.6 mL of water for injection into the 1 mL syringe. \n \nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will give you ‘water for injection’ with the medicine vial and \n\nsyringes. This is mixed with the Myalepta powder to dissolve the powder to make the liquid medicine \nthat you inject. The water for injection will come in either: \n\n• a plastic ampoule \n• a glass ampoule \n• a glass vial (with rubber stopper) \n\nAlways use a new ampoule or vial of water for injection. Never use remaining water for injection left \nover from a previous day’s preparation of Myalepta solution. \n \nPlastic ampoule of water for injection \n \n\n \n \nThe plastic ampoule is a sealed container with a twist-off top. \n \nTo remove the water for injection, break open the ampoule. \n\n• Hold the ampoule so that the top is facing up. \n• Hold the bottom of the ampoule in one hand and the top of the ampoule in your other hand. \n• Keeping the bottom of the ampoule still, gently twist the top of the ampoule until it is \n\nremoved. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n \n\n• Do not attach the needle to the syringe. \n• Without the needle attached, insert the 1 mL syringe tip into the top of the plastic ampoule as \n\nfar as possible. \n \nWith the syringe still in the ampoule, turn the ampoule and syringe upside down. The syringe will now \nbe facing up. \n \nWith the syringe still in the ampoule, pull the plunger down carefully, \n\n• Pull down until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 0.6 mL line. \n\n \n• You must check for air pockets or air bubbles in your 1 mL syringe. See steps 6-8 below on \n\nremoval of air pockets and air bubbles from the syringe. \n• Remove the syringe from the plastic ampoule. \n\n \nAttach the needle to the syringe. \n\n• Do not over-tighten the needle. \n• Do not remove the needle guard. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \nGlass ampoule of water for injection \n \n\n \n \nThe glass ampoule is a sealed container. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nBefore opening the water for injection ampoule, prepare the 1 mL syringe by attaching the needle to it. \nDo not over-tighten the needle. \n\n• Remove the needle guard. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \nTo remove the water for injection, break open the ampoule at the break-point as shown in the picture \nabove. \n\n• Hold the ampoule so that the tip is facing up. \n• Use the alcohol swab to clean the break point on the ampoule. \n• Hold the bottom of the ampoule in one hand and the top of the ampoule in your other hand. \n• Keeping the bottom of the ampoule still, snap the tip off. \n\n \n \nInsert the 1 mL syringe into the glass ampoule. \n\n• The glass ampoule should be at a 45 degree angle to the ground. \n• The needle should go as far into the ampoule as possible. \n\n \nWith the needle still in the ampoule, pull the plunger up carefully. \n\n• Pull up until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 0.6 mL line. \n• You must check for air pockets or air bubbles in your 1 mL syringe. See steps 6-8 below on \n\nremoval of air pockets and air bubbles from the syringe. \n\n \n \nGlass vial of water for injection  \n \n\n \n \nThe glass vial will have a plastic cap that you should remove, revealing a rubber seal below. \n\n• Do not remove the rubber seal. \n \nAttach the needle to the 1 mL syringe. Do not over-tighten the needle. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n• Remove the needle cover. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n• Pull the plunger down to the 0.6 mL line to draw air into the syringe. \n\n \nPlace the vial on a hard, flat surface. \n\n• Insert the 1 mL syringe needle into the vial, through the rubber seal. \n• The needle should be facing down. \n• The needle should go all the way into the vial. \n\n \nPush the plunger all the way down. \n\n \n \nWith the needle still in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. The needle will now be facing \nup. \n\n• Do not remove the needle from the vial. \n\n \n \nPull the plunger down carefully \n\n• Pull it down until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 0.6 mL line. \n\n \n \n6) No matter whether you have withdrawn water for injection from a vial or ampoule, you must check \nfor air pockets or air bubbles in your 1 mL syringe. \n\n• Sometimes, large spaces of air (air pockets) get caught inside the syringe. You might also see \nsmaller air bubbles in the syringe. \n\n• You must remove an air pocket and air bubbles from the syringe to make sure you get the \ncorrect amount of sterile water in the syringe. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n   \n \n7) Remove any air pocket or air bubbles. \n \nUsing the glass vial or plastic ampoule \n\n• With the syringe still inserted into the glass vial or plastic ampoule, tap the side of the syringe \nto move the air pocket/air bubbles to the top of the syringe. \n\n• Carefully push the plunger back up to force the air out of the syringe. \n \n\n \n \nUsing the glass ampoule \n\n• Remove the syringe from the ampoule and hold it so that the needle faces up. \n• Tap the side of the syringe to move the air pocket/air bubbles to the top of the syringe. \n• Carefully push the plunger back up to force the air out of the syringe. \n\n \n8) Check the amount of water for injection \n\n• If there is less than 0.6 mL of water for injection in the syringe, draw more water for injection \ninto the syringe and repeat the steps 6 and 7 until you have 0.6 mL in the syringe. \n\n \n9) With 0.6 mL of water for injection in the syringe, remove the syringe from the vial or ampoule. \n\n• Do not move the plunger. \n• Do not touch the exposed needle on your syringe as it is sterile, and you may damage the \n\nneedle or injure yourself. \n \nStep C: Dissolving Myalepta \n \n10) Make sure the vial of Myalepta powder has been out of the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes to \nreach room temperature. \n \n11) Remove the plastic cap from the vial of Myalepta powder. \n\n• Place the vial on a flat, hard surface. \n• Clean the top of the vial with the alcohol wipe. \n\n \n12) Insert the needle of the 1 mL syringe containing the 0.6 mL of water for injection all the way into \nthe Myalepta vial containing the powder. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n \n13) Hold the vial at 45 degree angle to the table and slowly push the plunger all the way down with \nyour thumb. \n\n• The water for injection should go down the inside wall of the vial. \n• All of the water for injection should be injected into the vial. \n\n \n\n \n \n14) Take the needle out of the vial and throw away the syringe into a sharps disposal container. \n \n\n \n \n15) Mix the powder and water for injection \n\n• Move the vial gently in a circle (swirling motion) \n• Until the powder dissolves and the liquid is clear. Do not shake or vigorously mix. \n• The solution will take less than 5 minutes to become clear. \n\nWhen properly mixed, the Myalepta solution should be clear and free of lumps of dry powder, bubbles \nor foam. Do not use the solution if it is not clear or has bits or lumps in it. Throw it away and start \nagain from step 1. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nStep D: Filling the syringe with Myalepta for injection \n \n16) To inject the Myalepta solution, you will use a new injection syringe, which will either be the \n0.3 mL, 1.0 mL, or 2.5 mL syringe that was provided to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nRemove the needle cover. \n\n• Do not touch the needle. \n• Do not move the plunger. \n\n \n17) Insert the needle through the centre of the rubber bung, all the way into the vial containing the \ndissolved Myalepta solution. \n \n\n \n \n18) With the needle in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. \n \n\n \n \n19) Keeping the needle inside the vial, pull the plunger down. \n\n• The top rim of the plunger should line up with the black line on the syringe that matches the \namount of Myalepta solution you are going to inject. \n\n \n\n \n \n20) Check for air pockets and air bubbles. \n\n• If you see an air pocket or any air bubbles, follow the same instructions described in step 7 to \nremove the air from the syringe. \n\n \n21) If the syringe contains your correct dose amount of Myalepta solution, remove the needle from the \nvial. \n\n• Do not move the plunger. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \nStep E: Choose and preparing where to inject \n \n22) Carefully choose where you want to inject Myalepta. You can inject this medicine into the \nfollowing areas: \n\n● stomach area (abdomen), except for a 5 cm area directly around the belly button \n● thigh \n● back of the upper arm \n\n \n \nIf you want to use the same area of the body for each injection, do not use the same spot that you used \nfor your last injection. \n\n• If you inject other medicines, do not inject Myalepta in the same site as you have done for \nthose other medicines. \n \n\n23) Clean the area where you will inject yourself with a clean alcohol swab and let the skin dry. \n• Do not touch the area you have cleaned until you are injecting Myalepta. \n\n \nStep F: Injecting Myalepta \n \nImportant: Myalepta must be injected under the skin (‘subcutaneous’). Do not inject into a muscle. \n \n24) To inject under the skin, pinch the skin with one hand where you are going to inject. \n \n\n \n \n25) With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n26) Gently insert the needle into the skin at approximately a 45 degree angle to the body. \n• Do not insert the needle into a muscle. \n• The needle is short in length, and all of the needle should go into the skin at a 45 degree angle. \n\n \n\n \n \n27) Gently use your thumb to push the plunger all the way down. \n\no Inject all of the medicine. \no If there is medicine left in the syringe, you have not had your full dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n28) Remove the syringe from the skin. \n \nStep G: Throwing away used materials \n \n29) Throw away the two used syringes and all caps, vials, or ampoules in the sharps disposal container \nstraight away. \n\no Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about correct disposal of your sharps disposal \ncontainer once it becomes full. There might be local regulations for this. \n\n \n\n \n \nImportant \n\no Do not use the syringes more than once. Use new syringes each time. \no The vials may remain almost completely filled with product after withdrawal of the required \n\ndose. Remaining solution should be discarded after use. \no Do not dissolve another dose of Myalepta powder with any ampoule or vial containing unused \n\nremaining water for injection. This unused water for injection should be disposed of in your \nsharps container. Always use a new ampoule or vial of water for injection each time when \npreparing to dissolve Myalepta powder. \n\n\n\n58 \n\no Do not recycle the syringes, caps, or sharps disposal container, or throw them into household \nwaste. \n\no Always keep the sharps disposal container out of reach of children. \n \n\n\n\n59 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nMyalepta 5.8 mg powder for solution for injection \nmetreleptin \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Myalepta is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Myalepta \n3. How to use Myalepta \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Myalepta \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Myalepta is and what it is used for \n \nMyalepta contains the active substance metreleptin. \n• Metreleptin is similar to a human hormone called leptin. \n \nWhat Myalepta is used for \nMyalepta is used to treat the complications of not having enough leptin in patients with lipodystrophy. \nIt is used in adults, adolescents and children 2 years or over: \n• who have generalised lipodystrophy (the whole of your body does not have enough fatty tissue)  \nIt is used, when other treatments have been ineffective, in adults, and adolescents 12 years or over: \n• who have partial lipodystrophy which is inherited (also called congenital or familial \n\nlipodystrophy)  \n• or partial lipodystrophy has been caused by your body’s response to something such as a viral \n\nillness (also called acquired lipodystrophy) \n \nHow Myalepta works \nNatural leptin is produced by fatty tissue and has many functions in the body including: \n• controlling how hungry you feel and your energy levels \n• helping the insulin in your body manage sugar levels. \nMetreleptin works by copying the effects of leptin. This improves the ability of the body to control \nenergy levels. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Myalepta \n \nDo not use Myalepta if: \n• you are allergic to metreleptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Myalepta if: \n• you are pregnant \n• you have ever had a type of cancer called lymphoma \n• you have ever had problems with your blood (such as a low blood count) \n• you have ever had inflammation of an organ called the pancreas (‘pancreatitis’) \n \nLymphoma \nPeople with lipodystrophy can get a type of blood cancer called lymphoma, whether or not they are \nusing Myalepta. \nHowever, you may be at higher risk of getting a lymphoma when using the medicinal product. \n• Your doctor will decide if you should use Myalepta and will monitor you during treatment. \n \nSerious and severe infections \nWhile being treated with Myalepta, your body might produce antibodies which may increase the risk \nof developing serious or severe infections. Tell your doctor straight-away if you develop a high \ntemperature, accompanied by increasing tiredness (see section 4). \n \nLow blood sugar with insulin or other anti-diabetic medicines \nIf you are using a medicine such as insulin or other medicines to treat diabetes, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your blood sugar. Your doctor will change your dose of insulin or other medicines if \nneeded. \nThis is to prevent your blood sugar from getting too low (‘hypo-glycaemia’). For signs of low blood \nsugar levels, see section 4 under ‘Signs of high and low blood sugar'. \n \nHigh blood sugar and fat levels \nYou may have higher amounts of sugar (‘hyper-glycaemia’) or fat (‘hyper-triglyceridaemia’) in your \nblood while on Myalepta, which may be a sign that this medicine is not working as well as it should. \nSigns of high blood sugar levels and high fat levels are listed in section 4 under “Signs of high and low \nblood sugar” and “Signs of high fat”. \nIf you notice any of the symptoms referred to above and described further in section 4 of this leaflet, \nor you are not sure, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor might need to change your \ntreatment. \n \nAllergic reactions \nWhile being treated with Myalepta, you may get an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor straight-away if \nyou have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction can be seen in section 4 \nunder “Allergic reactions”. \n \nFertility \nMyalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy (see section “Pregnancy, \nbreast-feeding and fertility”). \n \nHow to stop using Myalepta  \nIf you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks before \nstopping it altogether. Your doctor will also ask you to follow a reduced fat diet. \n\n• It is important to gradually reduce the dose over two weeks because this can help prevent a \nsudden increase in the levels of fat (called ‘triglycerides’) in your blood. \n\n• A sudden increase in the amount of triglyceride in your blood can make your pancreas \ninflamed (‘pancreatitis’). Gradually reducing your dose, and following a reduced fat diet may \n\nhelp to prevent this. \nYou should not stop using Myalepta unless your doctor tells you to. \n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years with generalised lipodystrophy, or \nbelow the age of 12 years with partial lipodystrophy. This is because it is not known how this \nmedicine will affect children under these ages. \n \nOther medicines and Myalepta \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Myalepta can \naffect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way this \nmedicine works. \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n• statins for reducing cholesterol (such as atorvastatin) \n• blood pressure medicines called ‘calcium channel blockers’ \n• theophylline used in lung problems such as asthma \n• blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin or phenprocoumon) \n• medicines for epilepsy or fits (such as phenytoin) \n• medicines which suppress the immune system (such as cyclosporine) \n• medicines for sleep or anxiety called ‘benzodiazepines’ \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before using Myalepta. Some \nmedicines need to be monitored while you are using Myalepta since the dose of these medicines might \nneed to be changed. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nYou should not use Myalepta if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it is not \nknown how metreleptin will affect your unborn baby. \n• Women who could get pregnant should use effective contraception, including non-hormonal \n\nmethods such as condoms, while using Myalepta.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You and your doctor will decide whether or not to \ncontinue breast-feeding while using this medicine. \nIt is not known if metreleptin will pass into breast milk.  \nMyalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMyalepta has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You might feel dizzy or tired \nwhen using this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. Talk to your \ndoctor if you are not sure.  \n \n \n3. How to use Myalepta \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nMyalepta is an injection once a day under the skin (‘subcutaneous injection’). This medicine is for use \nin children aged 2 years and above, adolescents and adults with generalised lipodystrophy; it is also for \nuse in children aged 12 years and above, adolescents and adults with partial lipodystrophy.  \nWhile using this medicine, you or your child will be monitored by your doctor, who will decide the \ndose you or your child should use. \n \nYour doctor may decide that you inject yourself. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how \nto prepare and inject this medicine. \n• Do not try to prepare the medicine or inject yourself if you have not been trained. \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\nHow much to inject \nYour dose of Myalepta may change over time depending on how this medicine works for you. The \nMyalepta powder is dissolved by mixing it with water for injections to make the solution for injecting. \nRead the “Instructions for Use” (see section 7) for how to make the solution before injecting. \nYour doctor will have prescribed the correct dose for you, based on the following: \n• If you weigh 40 kg or less: \n\n− A starting dose is 0.06 mg (0.012 mL of solution) for each kilogram of body weight. \n• If you are male and weigh more than 40 kg: \n\n− A starting dose is 2.5 mg (0.5 mL of solution). \n• If you are female and weigh more than 40 kg: \n\n− A starting dose is 5 mg (1 mL of solution). \nYour doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much of the solution to inject. If you are not sure how \nmuch of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before injecting. \n• The syringe you need to use to inject this medicine depends on the dose prescribed for you. \n\no Your pharmacist will give you the correct syringe for injecting. \no See the “Instructions for Use” to find out which syringe to use. \n\n• To know how much medicine to inject (in mL), you divide your dose (in mg) by 5. \no For example, if you have been prescribed a 5 mg dose of Myalepta, 5 mg divided by 5 gives \n\nyou 1 mL which is the amount you need to inject of the solution, using a 1 mL syringe. \n• If your dose is 1.50 mg (0.30 mL of solution) or less, you will need to use a 0.3 mL syringe. \n\no The 0.3 mL syringe will show the injection amount in ‘Unit’ instead of ‘mL’. See the \n“Instructions for Use” (section 7) for more information on reading and using the different \nsyringes. \n\no To know how much solution to inject (in Units), divide your dose (in mg) by 5, and then times \nit by 100. \n\nIf you need to inject 1 mL or more of Myalepta solution, your doctor might tell you to give the dose as \ntwo separate injections. This can help make the injections more comfortable. \nYou must use a clean syringe and needle for both injections. \nIf you are not sure how much of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \ninjecting. \nWhen small doses/volumes are prescribed (e.g. in children), the vials will remain almost completely \nfilled with product after withdrawal of the required dose. Remaining solution should be discarded after \nuse. \n \nIf you use more Myalepta than you should \nIf you use more Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Your \ndoctor will monitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you forget to use Myalepta \n• If you forget to inject a dose, inject it as soon as you remember. \n• Then have your normal dose the next day. \n• Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nIf you have injected less Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor will \nmonitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you stop using Myalepta \nDo not stop using Myalepta without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will decide if you should stop \nusing this medicine. \n \nIf you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks. See \nsection 2 “How to stop using Myalepta” for more information. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n4.

These will have been given to you by \nyour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. \n \nOn a clean, well-lit work surface, place the following items: \n• a glass vial of Myalepta powder \n• a container of water for injections for dissolving the Myalepta powder \n\no The water for injections might come in glass or plastic ampoules, or glass vials with a rubber \nstopper. \n\n• alcohol wipes (to clean your skin where you will inject and to clean the tops of the vials) \n• sharps disposal container (to safely dispose of the injection equipment afterwards) \n \nYou will also need 2 syringes: \n• One 3 mL syringe with a 21 gauge, 40 mm needle for dissolving the powder \n• One injection syringe with a much shorter needle for injecting the solution under your skin  \n\nThe size of this syringe will be chosen by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for your dose of \nMyalepta. \no If your dose is 1.5 mg or less, you will use a 0.3 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 1.5 mg up to 5 mg, you will use a 1 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 5 mg, you will use a 2.5 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 5 mg, your doctor, nurse or pharmacist might tell you to give the \n\ndose as two separate injections. See section 3 “How much to inject” for more information. \n \n\n \n \n2) Before preparing Myalepta solution, allow the powder vial to reach room temperature for about \n10 minutes. \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n \n3) Wash your hands before preparing the medicine. \n \nStep B: Filling the 3 mL syringe with 1.1 mL of water for injections \n \n4) Take the 3 mL syringe out of the plastic wrapper. Always use a new syringe. \n\n• The 3 mL syringe and needle will be provided separately. \n• How you connect the needle to the syringe will be depend on if you have been provided your \n\nwater for injection in a plastic ampoule, a glass ampoule, or a glass vial (see below for specific \ninstructions). \n \n\n5) Withdraw 1.1 mL of water for injection into the 3 mL syringe. \n \nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will give you ‘water for injection’ with the medicine vial and \nsyringes. This is mixed with the Myalepta powder to dissolve the powder to make the liquid medicine \nthat you inject. The water for injection will come in either: \n\n• a plastic ampoule \n• a glass ampoule \n• a glass vial (with rubber stopper) \n\nAlways use a new ampoule or vial of water for injection. Never use remaining water for injection left \nover from a previous day’s preparation of Myalepta solution. \n \nPlastic ampoule of water for injection \n \n\n \n \nThe plastic ampoule is a sealed container with a twist-off top. \n \nTo remove the water for injection, break open the ampoule. \n\n• Hold the ampoule so that the top is facing up. \n• Hold the bottom of the ampoule in one hand and the top of the ampoule in your other hand. \n• Keeping the bottom of the ampoule still, gently twist the top of the ampoule until it is \n\nremoved. \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n \n\n• Do not attach the needle to the syringe. \n• Without the needle attached, insert the 3 mL syringe tip into the top of the plastic ampoule as \n\nfar as possible. \n \nWith the syringe still in the ampoule, turn the ampoule and syringe upside down. The syringe will now \nbe facing up. \n \nWith the syringe still in the ampoule, pull the plunger down carefully, \n\n• Pull down until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 1.1 mL line. \n\n \n• You must check for air pockets or air bubbles in your 3 mL syringe. See steps 6-8 below on \n\nremoval of air pockets and air bubbles from the syringe. \n• Remove the syringe from the plastic ampoule. \n\n \nAttach the needle to the syringe. \n\n• Do not over-tighten the needle. \n• Do not remove the needle guard. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \nGlass ampoule of water for injection \n \n\n \n \nThe glass ampoule is a sealed container. \n \n\n\n\n72 \n\nBefore opening the water for injection ampoule, prepare the 3 mL syringe by attaching the needle to it. \nDo not over-tighten the needle. \n\n• Remove the needle guard. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \nTo remove the water for injection, break open the ampoule at the break-point as shown in the picture \nabove. \n\n• Hold the ampoule so that the tip is facing up. \n• Use the alcohol swab to clean the break point on the ampoule. \n• Hold the bottom of the ampoule in one hand and the top of the ampoule in your other hand. \n• Keeping the bottom of the ampoule still, snap the tip off. \n\n \n \nInsert the 3 mL syringe into the glass ampoule. \n\n• The glass ampoule should be at a 45 degree angle to the ground. \n• The needle should go as far into the ampoule as possible. \n\n \nWith the needle still in the ampoule, pull the plunger up carefully. \n\n• Pull up until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 1.1 mL line. \n• You must check for air pockets or air bubbles in your 3 mL syringe. See steps 6-8 below on \n\nremoval of air pockets and air bubbles from the syringe. \n\n \n \nGlass vial of water for injection  \n \n\n \n \nThe glass vial will have a plastic cap that you should remove, revealing a rubber seal below. \n\n• Do not remove the rubber seal. \n \nAttach the needle to the 3 mL syringe. Do not over-tighten the needle. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n• Remove the needle cover. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n• Pull the plunger down to the 1.1 mL line to draw air into the syringe. \n\n \nPlace the vial on a hard, flat surface. \n\n• Insert the 3 mL syringe needle into the vial, through the rubber seal. \n• The needle should be facing down. \n• The needle should go all the way into the vial. \n\n \nPush the plunger all the way down. \n\n \n \nWith the needle still in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. The needle will now be facing \nup. \n\n• Do not remove the needle from the vial. \n\n \n \nPull the plunger down carefully \n\n• Pull it down until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 1.1 mL line. \n\n \n \n6) No matter whether you have withdrawn water for injection from a vial or ampoule, you must check \nfor air pockets or air bubbles in your 3 mL syringe. \n\n• Sometimes, large spaces of air (air pockets) get caught inside the syringe. You might also see \nsmaller air bubbles in the syringe. \n\n• You must remove an air pocket and air bubbles from the syringe to make sure you get the \ncorrect amount of sterile water in the syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n \n7) Remove any air pocket or air bubbles. \n \nUsing the glass vial or plastic ampoule \n\n• With the syringe still inserted into the glass vial or plastic ampoule, tap the side of the syringe \nto move the air pocket/air bubbles to the top of the syringe. \n\n• Carefully push the plunger back up to force the air out of the syringe. \n \n\n \n \nUsing the glass ampoule \n\n• Remove the syringe from the ampoule and hold it so that the needle faces up. \n• Tap the side of the syringe to move the air pocket/air bubbles to the top of the syringe. \n• Carefully push the plunger back up to force the air out of the syringe. \n\n \n8) Check the amount of water for injection \n\n• If there is less than 1.1 mL of water for injection in the syringe, draw more water for injection \ninto the syringe and repeat the steps 6 and 7 until you have 1.1 mL in the syringe. \n\n \n9) With 1.1 mL of water for injection in the syringe, remove the syringe from the vial or ampoule. \n\n• Do not move the plunger. \n• Do not touch the exposed needle on your syringe as it is sterile, and you may damage the \n\nneedle or injure yourself. \n \nStep C: Dissolving Myalepta \n \n10) Make sure the vial of Myalepta powder has been out of the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes to \nreach room temperature. \n \n11) Remove the plastic cap from the vial of Myalepta powder. \n\n• Place the vial on a flat, hard surface. \n• Clean the top of the vial with the alcohol wipe. \n\n \n12) Insert the needle of the 3 mL syringe containing the 1.1 mL of water for injection all the way into \nthe Myalepta vial containing the powder. \n \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n \n13) Hold the vial at 45 degree angle to the table and slowly push the plunger all the way down with \nyour thumb. \n\n• The water for injection should go down the inside wall of the vial. \n• All of the water for injection should be injected into the vial. \n\n \n\n \n \n14) Take the needle out of the vial and throw away the syringe into a sharps disposal container. \n \n\n \n \n15) Mix the powder and water for injection \n\n• Move the vial gently in a circle (swirling motion) \n• Until the powder dissolves and the liquid is clear. Do not shake or vigorously mix. \n• The solution will take less than 5 minutes to become clear. \n\nWhen properly mixed, the Myalepta solution should be clear and free of lumps of dry powder, bubbles \nor foam. Do not use the solution if it is not clear or has bits or lumps in it. Throw it away and start \nagain from step 1. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nStep D: Filling the syringe with Myalepta for injection \n \n16) To inject the Myalepta solution, you will use a new injection syringe, which will either be the \n0.3 mL, 1.0 mL, or 2.5 mL syringe that was provided to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nRemove the needle cover. \n\n• Do not touch the needle. \n• Do not move the plunger. \n\n \n17) Insert the needle through the centre of the rubber bung, all the way into the vial containing the \ndissolved Myalepta solution. \n \n\n \n \n18) With the needle in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. \n \n\n \n \n19) Keeping the needle inside the vial, pull the plunger down. \n\n• The top rim of the plunger should line up with the black line on the syringe that matches the \namount of Myalepta solution you are going to inject. \n\n \n\n \n \n20) Check for air pockets and air bubbles. \n\n• If you see an air pocket or any air bubbles, follow the same instructions described in step 7 to \nremove the air from the syringe. \n\n \n21) If the syringe contains your correct dose amount of Myalepta solution, remove the needle from the \nvial. \n\n• Do not move the plunger. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \nStep E: Choose and preparing where to inject \n \n22) Carefully choose where you want to inject Myalepta. You can inject this medicine into the \nfollowing areas: \n\n● stomach area (abdomen), except for a 5 cm area directly around the belly button \n● thigh \n● back of the upper arm \n\n \n \nIf you want to use the same area of the body for each injection, do not use the same spot that you used \nfor your last injection. \n\n• If you inject other medicines, do not inject Myalepta in the same site as you have done for \nthose other medicines. \n \n\n23) Clean the area where you will inject yourself with a clean alcohol swab and let the skin dry. \n• Do not touch the area you have cleaned until you are injecting Myalepta. \n\n \nStep F: Injecting Myalepta \n \nImportant: Myalepta must be injected under the skin (‘subcutaneous’). Do not inject into a muscle. \n \n24) To inject under the skin, pinch the skin with one hand where you are going to inject. \n \n\n \n \n25) With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil. \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n26) Gently insert the needle into the skin at approximately a 45 degree angle to the body. \n• Do not insert the needle into a muscle. \n• The needle is short in length, and all of the needle should go into the skin at a 45 degree angle. \n\n \n\n \n \n27) Gently use your thumb to push the plunger all the way down. \n\no Inject all of the medicine. \no If there is medicine left in the syringe, you have not had your full dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n28) Remove the syringe from the skin. \n \nStep G: Throwing away used materials \n \n29) Throw away the two used syringes and all caps, vials, or ampoules in the sharps disposal container \nstraight away. \n\no Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about correct disposal of your sharps disposal \ncontainer once it becomes full. There might be local regulations for this. \n\n \n\n \n \nImportant \n\no Do not use the syringes more than once. Use new syringes each time. \no The vials may remain almost completely filled with product after withdrawal of the required \n\ndose. Remaining solution should be discarded after use. \no Do not dissolve another dose of Myalepta powder with any ampoule or vial containing unused \n\nremaining water for injection. This unused water for injection should be disposed of in your \nsharps container. Always use a new ampoule or vial of water for injection each time when \npreparing to dissolve Myalepta powder. \n\n\n\n79 \n\no Do not recycle the syringes, caps, or sharps disposal container, or throw them into household \nwaste. \n\no Always keep the sharps disposal container out of reach of children. \n\n\n\n80 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nMyalepta 11.3 mg powder for solution for injection \nmetreleptin \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Myalepta is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Myalepta \n3. How to use Myalepta \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Myalepta \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7. Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Myalepta is and what it is used for \n \nMyalepta contains the active substance metreleptin. \n• Metreleptin is similar to a human hormone called leptin. \n \nWhat Myalepta is used for \nMyalepta is used to treat the complications of not having enough leptin in patients with lipodystrophy. \nIt is used in adults, adolescents and children 2 years or over: \n• who have generalised lipodystrophy (the whole of your body does not have enough fatty tissue)  \nIt is used, when other treatments have been ineffective, in adults, and adolescents 12 years or over: \n• who have partial lipodystrophy which is inherited (also called congenital or familial \n\nlipodystrophy)  \n• or partial lipodystrophy has been caused by your body’s response to something such as a viral \n\nillness (also called acquired lipodystrophy) \n \nHow Myalepta works \nNatural leptin is produced by fatty tissue and has many functions in the body including: \n• controlling how hungry you feel and your energy levels \n• helping the insulin in your body manage sugar levels. \nMetreleptin works by copying the effects of leptin. This improves the ability of the body to control \nenergy levels. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Myalepta \n \nDo not use Myalepta if: \n• you are allergic to metreleptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Myalepta if: \n• you are pregnant \n• you have ever had a type of cancer called lymphoma \n• you have ever had problems with your blood (such as a low blood count) \n• you have ever had inflammation of an organ called the pancreas (‘pancreatitis’) \n \nLymphoma \nPeople with lipodystrophy can get a type of blood cancer called lymphoma, whether or not they are \nusing Myalepta. \nHowever, you may be at higher risk of getting a lymphoma when using the medicinal product. \n• Your doctor will decide if you should use Myalepta and will monitor you during treatment. \n \nSerious and severe infections \nWhile being treated with Myalepta, your body might produce antibodies which may increase the risk \nof developing serious or severe infections. Tell your doctor straight-away if you develop a high \ntemperature, accompanied by increasing tiredness (see section 4). \n \nLow blood sugar with insulin or other anti-diabetic medicines \nIf you are using a medicine such as insulin or other medicines to treat diabetes, your doctor will \nclosely monitor your blood sugar. Your doctor will change your dose of insulin or other medicines if \nneeded. \nThis is to prevent your blood sugar from getting too low (‘hypo-glycaemia’). For signs of low blood \nsugar levels, see section 4 under ‘Signs of high and low blood sugar'. \n \nHigh blood sugar and fat levels \nYou may have higher amounts of sugar (‘hyper-glycaemia’) or fat (‘hyper-triglyceridaemia’) in your \nblood while on Myalepta, which may be a sign that this medicine is not working as well as it should. \nSigns of high blood sugar levels and high fat levels are listed in section 4 under “Signs of high and low \nblood sugar” and “Signs of high fat”. \nIf you notice any of the symptoms referred to above and described further in section 4 of this leaflet, \nor you are not sure, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor might need to change your \ntreatment. \n \nAllergic reactions \nWhile being treated with Myalepta, you may get an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor straight-away if \nyou have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction can be seen in section 4 \nunder “Allergic reactions”. \n \nFertility \nMyalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy (see section “Pregnancy, \nbreast-feeding and fertility”). \n \nHow to stop using Myalepta  \nIf you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks before \nstopping it altogether. Your doctor will also ask you to follow a reduced fat diet. \n\n• It is important to gradually reduce the dose over two weeks because this can help prevent a \nsudden increase in the levels of fat (called ‘triglycerides’) in your blood. \n\n• A sudden increase in the amount of triglyceride in your blood can make your pancreas \ninflamed (‘pancreatitis’). Gradually reducing your dose, and following a reduced fat diet may \nhelp to prevent this. \n\nYou should not stop using Myalepta unless your doctor tells you to. \n \n\n\n\n82 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years with generalised lipodystrophy, or \nbelow the age of 12 years with partial lipodystrophy. This is because it is not known how this \nmedicine will affect children under these ages. \n \nOther medicines and Myalepta \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. Myalepta can \naffect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the way this \nmedicine works. \nIn particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: \n• statins for reducing cholesterol (such as atorvastatin) \n• blood pressure medicines called ‘calcium channel blockers’ \n• theophylline used in lung problems such as asthma \n• blood-thinning medicines (such as warfarin or phenprocoumon) \n• medicines for epilepsy or fits (such as phenytoin) \n• medicines which suppress the immune system (such as cyclosporine) \n• medicines for sleep or anxiety called ‘benzodiazepines’ \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before using Myalepta. Some \nmedicines need to be monitored while you are using Myalepta since the dose of these medicines might \nneed to be changed. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nYou should not use Myalepta if you are pregnant or might become pregnant. This is because it is not \nknown how metreleptin will affect your unborn baby. \n• Women who could get pregnant should use effective contraception, including non-hormonal \n\nmethods such as condoms, while using Myalepta.  \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You and your doctor will decide whether or not to \ncontinue breast-feeding while using this medicine. \nIt is not known if metreleptin will pass into breast milk.  \nMyalepta might increase fertility in women with lipodystrophy. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMyalepta has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. You might feel dizzy or tired \nwhen using this medicine. If this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines. Talk to your \ndoctor if you are not sure.  \n \n \n3. How to use Myalepta \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nMyalepta is an injection once a day under the skin (‘subcutaneous injection’). This medicine is for use \nin children aged 2 years and above, adolescents and adults with generalised lipodystrophy; it is also for \nuse in children aged 12 years and above, adolescents and adults with partial lipodystrophy.  \nWhile using this medicine, you or your child will be monitored by your doctor, who will decide the \ndose you or your child should use. \n \nYour doctor may decide that you inject yourself. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how \nto prepare and inject this medicine. \n• Do not try to prepare the medicine or inject yourself if you have not been trained. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nHow much to inject \nYour dose of Myalepta may change over time depending on how this medicine works for you. The \nMyalepta powder is dissolved by mixing it with water for injections to make the solution for injecting. \nRead the “Instructions for Use” (see section 7) for how to make the solution before injecting. \nYour doctor will have prescribed the correct dose for you, based on the following: \n• If you weigh 40 kg or less: \n\n− A starting dose is 0.06 mg (0.012 mL of solution) for each kilogram of body weight. \n• If you are male and weigh more than 40 kg: \n\n− A starting dose is 2.5 mg (0.5 mL of solution). \n• If you are female and weigh more than 40 kg: \n\n− A starting dose is 5 mg (1 mL of solution). \nYour doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much of the solution to inject. If you are not sure how \nmuch of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before injecting. \n• The syringe you need to use to inject this medicine depends on the dose prescribed for you. \n\no Your pharmacist will give you the correct syringe for injecting. \no See the “Instructions for Use” to find out which syringe to use. \n\n• To know how much medicine to inject (in mL), you divide your dose (in mg) by 5. \no For example, if you have been prescribed a 5 mg dose of Myalepta, 5 mg divided by 5 gives \n\nyou 1 mL which is the amount you need to inject of the solution, using a 1 mL syringe. \n• If your dose is 1.50 mg (0.30 mL of solution) or less, you will need to use a 0.3 mL syringe. \n\no The 0.3 mL syringe will show the injection amount in ‘Unit’ instead of ‘mL’. See the \n“Instructions for Use” (section 7) for more information on reading and using the different \n\nsyringes. \no To know how much solution to inject (in Units), divide your dose (in mg) by 5, and then times \n\nit by 100. \nIf you need to inject 1 mL or more of Myalepta solution, your doctor might tell you to give the dose as \ntwo separate injections. This can help make the injections more comfortable. \nYou must use a clean syringe and needle for both injections. \nIf you are not sure how much of the solution to inject, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before \ninjecting. \nWhen small doses/volumes are prescribed (e.g. in children), the vials will remain almost completely \nfilled with product after withdrawal of the required dose. Remaining solution should be discarded after \nuse. \n \nIf you use more Myalepta than you should \nIf you use more Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Your \ndoctor will monitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you forget to use Myalepta \n• If you forget to inject a dose, inject it as soon as you remember. \n• Then have your normal dose the next day. \n• Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \nIf you have injected less Myalepta than you should, talk to your doctor straight away. Your doctor will \nmonitor you for side effects. \n \nIf you stop using Myalepta \nDo not stop using Myalepta without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will decide if you should stop \nusing this medicine. \n \nIf you need to stop using Myalepta, your doctor will gradually reduce the dose over two weeks.

An example is given below for \nthe different syringe sizes. If your syringe looks different or has different dose markings, talk to your \ndoctor, nurse or pharmacist for more information. \n \nUsing the 0.3 mL syringe \n\n• The 0.3 mL syringe shows the injection amount in ‘U’ instead of ‘mL’. \n• ‘U’ means ‘Units’. \n• 1 U is the same as 0.01 mL. \n• Each 5 U is shown as a number with a big line. This is the same as 0.05 mL. \n• Each 1 U is shown as a smaller line between the big lines. This is the same as 0.01 mL. \n• Each 0.5 U is shown as a small line between two 1 U lines. This is the same as 0.005 mL. \n \n\n \n \n• To help with injecting Myalepta solution using the small 0.3 mL syringe, the last column in \n\nthe table below shows the ‘Unit’ measurement on the syringe that relates to the different \npotential doses of the medicine prescribed by your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\nConverting dose from ‘mL’ to ‘Units’ when using the 0.3 mL syringe \n\nWeight of \nchild \n\nDose of \nMyalepta \n\nAmount of mixed Myalepta \nsolution \n\nAmount of mixed Myalepta solution \nto inject in ‘Unit’ measurements on \n\nyour 0.3 mL syringe \n\n9 kg 0.54 mg 0.10 mL 10 \n10 kg 0.60 mg 0.12 mL 12 \n11 kg 0.66 mg 0.13 mL 13 \n12 kg 0.72 mg 0.14 mL 14 \n13 kg 0.78 mg 0.15 mL 15 \n14 kg 0.84 mg 0.16 mL 16 \n15 kg 0.90 mg 0.18 mL 18 \n16 kg 0.96 mg 0.19 mL 19 \n17 kg 1.02 mg 0.20 mL 20 \n18 kg 1.08 mg 0.21 mL 21 \n19 kg 1.14 mg 0.22 mL 22 \n20 kg 1.20 mg 0.24 mL 24 \n21 kg 1.26 mg 0.25 mL 25 \n22 kg 1.32 mg 0.26 mL 26 \n23 kg 1.38 mg 0.27 mL 27 \n24 kg 1.44 mg 0.28 mL 28 \n25 kg 1.50 mg 0.30 mL 30 \n\n \nUsing the 1 mL syringe \n\n• This syringe shows the injection amount in mL, so you should inject the amount your doctor, \nnurse, or pharmacist has told you to. You do not need to convert the amount from mL to \nUnits. \n\n• You will be given the 1 mL syringe to use if your daily dose is more than 1.5 mg up to 5 mg, \nwhich as a volume is greater than 0.3 mL up to 1.0 mL of Myalepta solution. \n\n• Each 0.1 mL is shown as a number with a big line. \n• Each 0.05 mL is shown as a medium size line. \n• Each 0.01 mL is shown as a smaller line. \n\n \n \nUsing the 2.5 mL syringe \n\n• This syringe shows the injection amount in mL, so you should inject the amount your doctor, \nnurse, or pharmacist has told you to. You do not need to convert the amount from mL to \nUnits. \n\n• You will be given the 2.5 mL syringe to use if your daily dose is more than 5 mg up to 10 mg, \nwhich as a volume is greater than 1.0 mL of Myalepta solution. \n\n• Each 0.5 mL is shown as a number next to a big line. \n• Each 0.1 mL is shown as a smaller line between the big lines. \n\n\n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n \nStep A: Setting up \n \n1) Get together all the materials you will need for your injection. These will have been given to you by \nyour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. \n \nOn a clean, well-lit work surface, place the following items: \n• a glass vial of Myalepta powder \n• a container of water for injections for dissolving the Myalepta powder \n\no The water for injections might come in glass or plastic ampoules, or glass vials with a rubber \nstopper. \n\n• alcohol wipes (to clean your skin where you will inject and to clean the tops of the vials) \n• sharps disposal container (to safely dispose of the injection equipment afterwards) \n \nYou will also need 2 syringes: \n• One 3 mL syringe with a 21 gauge, 40 mm needle for dissolving the powder \n• One injection syringe with a much shorter needle for injecting the solution under your skin  \n\nThe size of this syringe will be chosen by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for your dose of \nMyalepta. \no If your dose is 1.5 mg or less, you will use a 0.3 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 1.5 mg up to 5 mg, you will use a 1 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 5 mg, you will use a 2.5 mL syringe. \no If your dose is more than 5 mg, your doctor, nurse or pharmacist might tell you to give the \n\ndose as two separate injections. See section 3 “How much to inject” for more information. \n \n\n \n \n2) Before preparing Myalepta solution, allow the powder vial to reach room temperature for about \n10 minutes. \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n \n3) Wash your hands before preparing the medicine. \n \nStep B: Filling the 3 mL syringe with 2.2 mL of water for injections \n \n4) Take the 3 mL syringe out of the plastic wrapper. Always use a new syringe. \n\n• The 3 mL syringe and needle will be provided separately. \n• How you connect the needle to the syringe will be depend on if you have been provided your \n\nwater for injection in a plastic ampoule, a glass ampoule, or a glass vial (see below for specific \ninstructions). \n \n\n5) Withdraw 2.2 mL of water for injection into the 3 mL syringe. \n \nYour doctor, nurse or pharmacist will give you ‘water for injection’ with the medicine vial and \nsyringes. This is mixed with the Myalepta powder to dissolve the powder to make the liquid medicine \nthat you inject. The water for injection will come in either: \n\n• a plastic ampoule \n• a glass ampoule \n• a glass vial (with rubber stopper) \n\nAlways use a new ampoule or vial of water for injection. Never use remaining water for injection left \nover from a previous day’s preparation of Myalepta solution. \n \nPlastic ampoule of water for injection \n \n\n \n \nThe plastic ampoule is a sealed container with a twist-off top. \n \nTo remove the water for injection, break open the ampoule. \n\n• Hold the ampoule so that the top is facing up. \n• Hold the bottom of the ampoule in one hand and the top of the ampoule in your other hand. \n• Keeping the bottom of the ampoule still, gently twist the top of the ampoule until it is \n\nremoved. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n \n\n• Do not attach the needle to the syringe. \n• Without the needle attached, insert the 3 mL syringe tip into the top of the plastic ampoule as \n\nfar as possible. \n \nWith the syringe still in the ampoule, turn the ampoule and syringe upside down. The syringe will now \nbe facing up. \n \nWith the syringe still in the ampoule, pull the plunger down carefully, \n\n• Pull down until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 2.2 mL line. \n\n \n• You must check for air pockets or air bubbles in your 3 mL syringe. See steps 6-8 below on \n\nremoval of air pockets and air bubbles from the syringe. \n• Remove the syringe from the plastic ampoule. \n\n \nAttach the needle to the syringe. \n\n• Do not over-tighten the needle. \n• Do not remove the needle guard. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \nGlass ampoule of water for injection \n \n\n \n \nThe glass ampoule is a sealed container. \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \nBefore opening the water for injection ampoule, prepare the 3 mL syringe by attaching the needle to it. \nDo not over-tighten the needle. \n\n• Remove the needle guard. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \nTo remove the water for injection, break open the ampoule at the break-point as shown in the picture \nabove. \n\n• Hold the ampoule so that the tip is facing up. \n• Use the alcohol swab to clean the break point on the ampoule. \n• Hold the bottom of the ampoule in one hand and the top of the ampoule in your other hand. \n• Keeping the bottom of the ampoule still, snap the tip off. \n\n \n \nInsert the 3 mL syringe into the glass ampoule. \n\n• The glass ampoule should be at a 45 degree angle to the ground. \n• The needle should go as far into the ampoule as possible. \n\n \nWith the needle still in the ampoule, pull the plunger up carefully. \n\n• Pull up until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 2.2 mL line. \n• You must check for air pockets or air bubbles in your 3 mL syringe. See steps 6-8 below on \n\nremoval of air pockets and air bubbles from the syringe. \n\n \n \nGlass vial of water for injection  \n \n\n \n \nThe glass vial will have a plastic cap that you should remove, revealing a rubber seal below. \n\n• Do not remove the rubber seal. \n \nAttach the needle to the 3 mL syringe. Do not over-tighten the needle. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n• Remove the needle cover. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n• Pull the plunger down to the 2.2 mL line to draw air into the syringe. \n\n \nPlace the vial on a hard, flat surface. \n\n• Insert the 3 mL syringe needle into the vial, through the rubber seal. \n• The needle should be facing down. \n• The needle should go all the way into the vial. \n\n \nPush the plunger all the way down. \n\n \n \nWith the needle still in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. The needle will now be facing \nup. \n\n• Do not remove the needle from the vial. \n\n \n \nPull the plunger down carefully \n\n• Pull it down until the top rim of the plunger lines up with the black 2.2 mL line. \n\n \n \n6) No matter whether you have withdrawn water for injection from a vial or ampoule, you must check \nfor air pockets or air bubbles in your 3 mL syringe. \n\n• Sometimes, large spaces of air (air pockets) get caught inside the syringe. You might also see \nsmaller air bubbles in the syringe. \n\n• You must remove an air pocket and air bubbles from the syringe to make sure you get the \ncorrect amount of sterile water in the syringe. \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n \n7) Remove any air pocket or air bubbles. \n \nUsing the glass vial or plastic ampoule \n\n• With the syringe still inserted into the glass vial or plastic ampoule, tap the side of the syringe \nto move the air pocket/air bubbles to the top of the syringe. \n\n• Carefully push the plunger back up to force the air out of the syringe. \n \n\n \n \nUsing the glass ampoule \n\n• Remove the syringe from the ampoule and hold it so that the needle faces up. \n• Tap the side of the syringe to move the air pocket/air bubbles to the top of the syringe. \n• Carefully push the plunger back up to force the air out of the syringe. \n\n \n8) Check the amount of water for injection \n\n• If there is less than 2.2 mL of water for injection in the syringe, draw more water for injection \ninto the syringe and repeat the steps 6 and 7 until you have 2.2 mL in the syringe. \n\n \n9) With 2.2 mL of water for injection in the syringe, remove the syringe from the vial or ampoule. \n\n• Do not move the plunger. \n• Do not touch the exposed needle on your syringe as it is sterile, and you may damage the \n\nneedle or injure yourself. \n \nStep C: Dissolving Myalepta \n \n10) Make sure the vial of Myalepta powder has been out of the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes to \nreach room temperature. \n \n11) Remove the plastic cap from the vial of Myalepta powder. \n\n• Place the vial on a flat, hard surface. \n• Clean the top of the vial with the alcohol wipe. \n\n \n12) Insert the needle of the 3 mL syringe containing the 2.2 mL of water for injection all the way into \nthe Myalepta vial containing the powder. \n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n \n13) Hold the vial at 45 degree angle to the table and slowly push the plunger all the way down with \nyour thumb. \n\n• The water for injection should go down the inside wall of the vial. \n• All of the water for injection should be injected into the vial. \n\n \n\n \n \n14) Take the needle out of the vial and throw away the syringe into a sharps disposal container. \n \n\n \n \n15) Mix the powder and water for injection \n\n• Move the vial gently in a circle (swirling motion) \n• Until the powder dissolves and the liquid is clear. Do not shake or vigorously mix. \n• The solution will take less than 5 minutes to become clear. \n\nWhen properly mixed, the Myalepta solution should be clear and free of lumps of dry powder, bubbles \nor foam. Do not use the solution if it is not clear or has bits or lumps in it. Throw it away and start \nagain from step 1. \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nStep D: Filling the syringe with Myalepta for injection \n \n16) To inject the Myalepta solution, you will use a new injection syringe, which will either be the \n0.3 mL, 1.0 mL, or 2.5 mL syringe that was provided to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \nRemove the needle cover. \n\n• Do not touch the needle. \n• Do not move the plunger. \n\n \n17) Insert the needle through the centre of the rubber bung, all the way into the vial containing the \ndissolved Myalepta solution. \n \n\n \n \n18) With the needle in the vial, turn the vial and syringe upside down. \n \n\n \n \n19) Keeping the needle inside the vial, pull the plunger down. \n\n• The top rim of the plunger should line up with the black line on the syringe that matches the \namount of Myalepta solution you are going to inject. \n\n \n\n \n \n20) Check for air pockets and air bubbles. \n\n• If you see an air pocket or any air bubbles, follow the same instructions described in step 7 to \nremove the air from the syringe. \n\n \n21) If the syringe contains your correct dose amount of Myalepta solution, remove the needle from the \nvial. \n\n• Do not move the plunger. \n• Do not touch the needle. \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \nStep E: Choose and preparing where to inject \n \n22) Carefully choose where you want to inject Myalepta. You can inject this medicine into the \nfollowing areas: \n\n• stomach area (abdomen), except for a 5 cm area directly around the belly button \n• thigh \n• back of the upper arm \n\n \n \nIf you want to use the same area of the body for each injection, do not use the same spot that you used \nfor your last injection. \n\n• If you inject other medicines, do not inject Myalepta in the same site as you have done for \nthose other medicines. \n \n\n23) Clean the area where you will inject yourself with a clean alcohol swab and let the skin dry. \n• Do not touch the area you have cleaned until you are injecting Myalepta. \n\n \nStep F: Injecting Myalepta \n \nImportant: Myalepta must be injected under the skin (‘subcutaneous’). Do not inject into a muscle. \n \n24) To inject under the skin, pinch the skin with one hand where you are going to inject. \n \n\n \n \n25) With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil. \n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n26) Gently insert the needle into the skin at approximately a 45 degree angle to the body. \n• Do not insert the needle into a muscle. \n• The needle is short in length, and all of the needle should go into the skin at a 45 degree angle. \n\n \n\n \n \n27) Gently use your thumb to push the plunger all the way down. \n\n• Inject all of the medicine. \n• If there is medicine left in the syringe, you have not had your full dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n28) Remove the syringe from the skin. \n \nStep G: Throwing away used materials \n \n29) Throw away the two used syringes and all caps, vials, or ampoules in the sharps disposal container \nstraight away. \n\n• Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about correct disposal of your sharps disposal \ncontainer once it becomes full. There might be local regulations for this. \n\n \n\n \n \nImportant \n\n• Do not use the syringes more than once. Use new syringes each time. \n• The vials may remain almost completely filled with product after withdrawal of the required \n\ndose. Remaining solution should be discarded after use. \n• Do not dissolve another dose of Myalepta powder with any ampoule or vial containing unused \n\nremaining water for injection. This unused water for injection should be disposed of in your \nsharps container. Always use a new ampoule or vial of water for injection each time when \npreparing to dissolve Myalepta powder. \n\n\n\n100 \n\n• Do not recycle the syringes, caps, or sharps disposal container, or throw them into household \nwaste. \n\n• Always keep the sharps disposal container out of reach of children. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
