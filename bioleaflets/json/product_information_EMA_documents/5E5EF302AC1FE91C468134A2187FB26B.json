NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nBetaferon 250 microgram/ml, powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nRecombinant interferon beta-1b* 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) per ml when reconstituted. \n \nBetaferon contains 300 microgram (9.6 million IU) of recombinant interferon beta-1b per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n* produced by genetic engineering from a strain of Escherichia coli. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nSterile white to off-white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBetaferon is indicated for the treatment of  \n• patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe \n\nenough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been \nexcluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple \nsclerosis (see section 5.1). \n\n• patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two \nyears.  \n\n• patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by \nrelapses.  \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe treatment with Betaferon should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in \nthe treatment of the disease. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of Betaferon is 250 microgram (8.0 million IU), contained in 1 ml of the \nreconstituted solution (see section 6.6), to be injected subcutaneously every other day. \n \nPaediatric population  \nNo formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. \nHowever, limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 16 years of \nage receiving Betaferon 8.0 million IU subcutaneously every other day is similar to that seen in adults. \nThere is no information on the use of Betaferon in children under 12 years of age. Therefore Betaferon \nshould not be used in this population.  \n \nGenerally, dose titration is recommended at the start of treatment. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPatients should be started at 62.5 microgram (0.25 ml) subcutaneously every other day, and increased \nslowly to a dose of 250 microgram (1.0 ml) every other day (see Table A). The titration period may be \nadjusted, if any significant adverse reaction occurs. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose of 250 \nmicrogram (1.0 ml) every other day should be reached. \n \nA titration pack composed of four triple packs is available for the titration period and the patient’s \ninitial treatment with Betaferon. This package meets the patient’s needs for the first 12 injections. The \ntriple packs are highlighted in different colours (see section 6.5). \n \nTable A: Schedule for dose titration* \n\ntreatment day dose volume  \n1, 3, 5 62.5  microgram 0.25 ml \n\n7, 9, 11 125 microgram 0.5  ml \n13, 15, 17 187.5 microgram 0.75 ml \n\n19, 21, 23 et seq. 250 microgram 1.0 ml \n* The titration period may be adjusted, if any significant adverse reaction occurs. \n \nThe optimal dose has not been fully clarified. \n \nAt the present time, it is not known how long the patient should be treated for. There are follow-up \ndata under controlled clinical conditions for patients with relapsing-remitting MS for up to 5 years and \nfor patients with secondary progressive MS for up to 3 years. For relapsing-remitting MS, efficacy has \nbeen demonstrated for therapy for the first two years. The available data for the additional three years \nare consistent with sustained treatment efficacy of Betaferon over the whole time period. \nIn patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, the progression to clinically \ndefinite multiple sclerosis was significantly delayed over a period of five years. \n \nTreatment is not recommended in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have \nexperienced less than 2 relapses in the previous 2 years or in patients with secondary-progressive \nmultiple sclerosis who have had no active disease in the previous 2 years. \n \nIf the patient fails to respond, for example a steady progression in EDSS for 6 months occurs or \ntreatment with at least 3 courses of ACTH or corticosteroids during a one year period is required \ndespite Betaferon therapy, treatment with Betaferon should be stopped. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor subcutaneous injection. \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n− Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human \n\nalbumin or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n− Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n− Patients with decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nImmune system disorders \nThe administration of cytokines to patients with a pre-existing monoclonal gammopathy has been \nassociated with the development of systemic capillary leak syndrome with shock-like symptoms and \nfatal outcome. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nIn rare cases, pancreatitis was observed with Betaferon use, often associated with \nhypertriglyceridaemia. \n \nNervous system disorders \nBetaferon should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive \ndisorders, in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and \nsuicidal ideation are known to occur with increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and \nin association with interferon use. Patients treated with Betaferon should be advised to report any \nsymptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician immediately. Patients \nexhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Betaferon and treated \nappropriately. Cessation of therapy with Betaferon should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and \n4.8). \n \nBetaferon should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures and to those \nreceiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with \nanti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).  \n \nThis product contains human albumin and hence carries a potential risk for transmission of viral \ndiseases. A risk for transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be excluded. \n \nLaboratory test \nThyroid function tests are recommended regularly in patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction or \nas clinically indicated.  \n \nIn addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, \ncomplete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, \nincluding liver function tests (e.g. AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and γ-GT), are recommended prior to \ninitiation and at regular intervals following introduction of Betaferon therapy, and then periodically \nthereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.  \n \nPatients with anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (alone or in any combination) may require more \nintensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Patients who \ndevelop neutropenia should be monitored closely for the development of fever or infection. There have \nbeen reports of thrombocytopenia, with profound decreases in platelet count. \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \nAsymptomatic elevations of serum transaminases, in most cases mild and transient, occurred very \ncommonly in patients treated with Betaferon during clinical trials. As for other beta interferons, severe \nhepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure, has been reported rarely in patients treated with \nBetaferon. The most serious events often occurred in patients exposed to other drugs or substances \nknown to be associated with hepatotoxicity or in the presence of comorbid medical conditions (e.g. \nmetastasising malignant disease, severe infection and sepsis, alcohol abuse). \n \nPatients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury. The occurrence of elevations in serum \ntransaminases should lead to close monitoring and investigation. Withdrawal of Betaferon should be \nconsidered if the levels significantly increase or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as \njaundice. In the absence of clinical evidence for liver damage and after normalisation of liver enzymes \na reintroduction of therapy could be considered with appropriate follow-up of hepatic functions. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nCaution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta to \npatients with severe renal failure. \n \nNephrotic Syndrome \nCases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal \nsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during \ntreatment with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment \nand may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs \nor symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in \npatients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and \ndiscontinuation of treatment with Betaferon should be considered. \n \nCardiac disorders \nBetaferon should also be used with caution in patients who suffer from pre-existing cardiac disorders. \nPatients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease, such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery \ndisease or arrhythmia, should be monitored for worsening of their cardiac condition, particularly \nduring initiation of treatment with Betaferon.  \nWhile Betaferon does not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, symptoms of the flu-like \nsyndrome associated with beta interferons may prove stressful to patients with pre-existing significant \ncardiac disease. During the post-marketing period very rare reports have been received of worsening \nof cardiac status in patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease temporarily associated with \nthe initiation of Betaferon therapy. \n \nRare cases of cardiomyopathy have been reported. If this occurs and a relationship to Betaferon is \nsuspected, treatment should be discontinued. \n \nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and Haemolytic anaemia (HA) \nCases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta \nproducts. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central \nnervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings \nsuggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \ndue to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical \nfeatures of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and \nrenal function is recommended.  \nAdditionally, cases of HA not associated with TMA, including immune HA, have been reported with \ninterferon beta products. Life-threatening and fatal cases have been reported. Cases of TMA and/or \nHA have been reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several \nyears after starting treatment with interferon beta. \nIf TMA and/or HA is diagnosed and a relationship to Betaferon is suspected, prompt treatment is \nrequired (in case of TMA considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Betaferon \nis recommended. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nSerious hypersensitivity reactions (rare but severe acute reactions such as bronchospasm, anaphylaxis \nand urticaria) may occur. If reactions are severe, Betaferon should be discontinued and appropriate \nmedical intervention instituted.  \n \nInjection site necrosis has been reported in patients using Betaferon (see section 4.8). It can be \nextensive and may involve muscle fascia as well as fat and therefore can result in scar formation. \nOccasionally debridement and, less often, skin grafting are required, and healing may take up to \n6 months. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIf the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of \nfluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with his/her physician before \ncontinuing injections with Betaferon.  \n \nIf the patient has multiple lesions Betaferon should be discontinued until healing has occurred. \nPatients with single lesions may continue on Betaferon provided the necrosis is not too extensive, as \nsome patients have experienced healing of injection site necrosis whilst on Betaferon. \n \nTo minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: \n− use an aseptic injection technique \n− rotate the injection sites with each dose. \n \nThe incidence of injection site reactions may be reduced by the use of an autoinjector. In the pivotal \nstudy of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis an autoinjector was used \nin the majority of patients. Injection site reactions as well as injection site necroses were observed less \nfrequently in this study than in the other pivotal studies. \n \nThe procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if \ninjection site reactions have occurred. \n \nImmunogenicity \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Serum samples in controlled \nclinical trials were collected every 3 months for monitoring of development of antibodies to Betaferon.  \n \nIn the different controlled clinical trials in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary \nprogressive multiple sclerosis, between 23% and 41% of the patients developed serum interferon beta-\n1b neutralising activity confirmed by at least two consecutive positive titres; of these patients, between \n43% and 55% converted to a stable antibody negative status (based on two consecutive negative titres) \nduring the subsequent observational period of the respective study.  \n \nThe development of neutralising activity in these studies is associated with a reduction in clinical \nefficacy only with regard to relapse activity. Some analyses suggest that this effect might be larger in \npatients with higher titre levels of neutralising activity.  \n \nIn the study of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, neutralising \nactivity measured every 6 months was observed at least once in 32% (89) of the patients treated \nimmediately with Betaferon; of these, 60% (53) returned to negative status based on the last available \nassessment within the 5 year period. Within this period, the development of neutralising activity was \nassociated with a significant increase in newly active lesions and T2 lesion volume on magnetic \nresonance imaging. However, this did not seem to be associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy \n(with regard to time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS), time to confirmed EDSS \nprogression and relapse rate).  \n \nNew adverse events have not been associated with the development of neutralising activity.  \n \nIt has been demonstrated in vitro that Betaferon cross-reacts with natural interferon beta. However, \nthis has not been investigated in vivo and its clinical significance is uncertain. \n \nThere are sparse and inconclusive data on patients who have developed neutralising activity and have \ncompleted Betaferon therapy. \n \nThe decision to continue or discontinue treatment should be based on all aspects of the patient’s \ndisease status rather than on neutralising activity status alone. \n \nExcipients \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nThe effect of alternate-day administration of 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) of Betaferon on drug \nmetabolism in multiple sclerosis patients is unknown. Corticosteroid or ACTH treatment of relapses \nfor periods of up to 28 days has been well tolerated in patients receiving Betaferon. \n \nDue to the lack of clinical experience in multiple sclerosis patients, the use of Betaferon together with \nimmunomodulators other than corticosteroids or ACTH is not recommended. \n \nInterferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes \nin humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when Betaferon is administered in combination \nwith medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic \ncytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. anti-epileptics. Additional caution should be exercised \nwith any co-medication which has an effect on the haematopoietic system. \n \nNo interaction studies with anti-epileptics have been carried out. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nA large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) from interferon beta registries, national \nregistries and post-marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies \nafter pre-conception exposure or exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the \nduration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected when \ninterferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment likely interrupted when \npregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and third \ntrimester is very limited. \n \nBased on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The \nrisk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be \nevaluated based on the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an increased risk so far. \n\nIf clinically needed, the use of Betaferon may be considered during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nLimited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1b into breast milk, together with the \nchemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1b \nexcreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are \nanticipated. \n \nBetaferon can be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nNo investigations on fertility have been conducted (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nCentral nervous system-related adverse events associated with the use of Betaferon might influence \nthe ability to drive and use machines in susceptible patients. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSummary of the safety profile \nAt the beginning of treatment adverse reactions are common but in general they subside with further \ntreatment. The most frequently observed adverse reactions are a flu-like symptom complex (fever, \nchills, arthralgia, malaise, sweating, headache, or myalgia), which is mainly due to the \npharmacological effects of the medicinal product, and injection site reactions. Injection site reactions \noccurred frequently after administration of Betaferon. Redness, swelling, discolouration, \ninflammation, pain, hypersensitivity, necrosis and non-specific reactions were significantly associated \nwith 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) Betaferon treatment.  \nThe most serious adverse reactions reported include thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and \nhaemolytic anaemia (HA). \n \nGenerally, dose titration is recommended at the start of treatment in order to increase tolerability to \nBetaferon (see section 4.2). Flu-like symptoms may also be reduced by administration of non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs. The incidence of injection site reactions may be reduced by the use of an \nautoinjector. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse event listing is based on reports from clinical trials (Table 1, adverse events \nand laboratory abnormalities) and from the post-marketing surveillance (Table 2, frequencies – where \nknown- based on pooled clinical trials (very common ≥1/10, common ≥1/100 to <1/10, uncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100, rare ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000, very rare < 1/10,000)) of Betaferon use.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cytokines, Interferons,  \nATC Code: L03 AB 08 \n \nMechanism of action \nInterferons belong to the family of cytokines, which are naturally occurring proteins. Interferons have \nmolecular weights ranging from 15,000 to 21,000 Daltons. Three major classes of interferons have \nbeen identified: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferon alpha, interferon beta, and interferon gamma have \noverlapping yet distinct biologic activities. The activities of interferon beta-1b are species-restricted \nand therefore, the most pertinent pharmacological information on interferon beta-1b is derived from \nstudies of human cells in culture or in human in vivo studies. \n \nInterferon beta-1b has been shown to possess both antiviral and immunoregulatory activities. The \nmechanisms by which interferon beta-1b exerts its actions in multiple sclerosis are not clearly \nunderstood. However, it is known that the biologic response-modifying properties of interferon \nbeta-1b are mediated through its interactions with specific cell receptors found on the surface of \nhuman cells. The binding of interferon beta-1b to these receptors induces the expression of a number \nof gene products that are believed to be the mediators of the biological actions of interferon beta-1b. A \nnumber of these products have been measured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected \nfrom patients treated with interferon beta-1b. Interferon beta-1b both decreases the binding affinity \nand enhances the internalisation and degradation of the interferon-gamma receptor. Interferon beta-1b \nalso enhances the suppressor activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. \n \nNo separate investigations were performed regarding the influence of Betaferon on the cardiovascular \nsystem, respiratory system and the function of endocrine organs. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRR-MS \nOne controlled clinical trial with Betaferon in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and \nable to walk unaided (baseline EDSS 0 to 5.5) was performed. Patients receiving Betaferon showed a \nreduction in frequency (30%) and severity of clinical relapses, as well as the number of \nhospitalisations due to disease. Furthermore, there was a prolongation of the relapse-free interval. \nThere is no evidence of an effect of Betaferon on the duration of relapses or on symptoms in between \nrelapses, and no significant effect was seen on the progression of the disease in relapsing-remitting \nmultiple sclerosis. \n \nSP-MS \nTwo controlled clinical trials with Betaferon involving a total of 1,657 patients with secondary \nprogressive multiple sclerosis (baseline EDSS 3 to 6.5, i.e. patients were able to walk) were \nperformed. Patients with mild disease and those unable to walk were not studied. The two studies \nshowed inconsistent results for the primary endpoint time to confirmed progression, representing delay \nof disability progression: \n \nOne of the two studies demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the time to disability \nprogression (Hazard Ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (0.55, 0.86), p=0.0010, corresponding to a \n31% risk reduction due to Betaferon) and in the time to becoming wheelchair bound (Hazard Ratio = \n0.61, 95% confidence interval (0.44, 0.85), p=0.0036, corresponding to a 39% risk reduction due to \nBetaferon) in patients who received Betaferon. This effect continued over the observation period of up \nto 33 months. The treatment effect occurred in patients at all levels of disability investigated and \nindependent of relapse activity. \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIn the second trial of Betaferon in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, no delay in the time to \ndisability progression was observed. There is evidence that the patients included in this study had \noverall less active disease than in the other study in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. \n \nIn retrospective meta-analyses including the data of both studies, an overall treatment effect was found \nwhich was statistically significant (p=0.0076; 8.0 million IU Betaferon versus all placebo patients). \n \nRetrospective analyses in subgroups showed that a treatment effect on disability progression is most \nlikely in patients with active disease before treatment commences (Hazard Ratio 0.72, 95% confidence \ninterval (0.59, 0.88), p=0.0011, corresponding to a 28 % risk reduction due to Betaferon in patients \nwith relapses or pronounced EDSS progression, 8.0 million IU Betaferon versus all placebo patients).  \n \nFrom these retrospective subgroup analyses there was evidence to suggest that relapses as well as \npronounced EDSS progression (EDSS >1 point or >0.5 point for EDSS ≥6 in the previous two years) \ncan help to identify patients with active disease. \n \nIn both trials secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients receiving Betaferon showed a reduction \nin frequency (30%) of clinical relapses. There is no evidence of Betaferon having an effect on the \nduration of relapses. \n \nSingle clinical event suggestive of MS \nOne controlled clinical trial with Betaferon was performed in patients with a single clinical event and \nMRI features suggestive of multiple sclerosis (at least two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted \nMRI). Patients with monofocal or multifocal onset of the disease were included (i.e. patients with \nclinical evidence for a single or at least two lesions, respectively, of the central nervous system). Any \ndisease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to \nbe excluded. This study consisted of two phases, a placebo-controlled phase followed by a pre-planned \nfollow-up phase. The placebo-controlled phase lasted for 2 years or until the patient developed \nclinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS), whichever came first. After the placebo-controlled \nphase, patients entered a pre-planned follow-up phase with Betaferon to evaluate the effects of \nimmediate versus delayed start of Betaferon treatment, comparing patients initially randomized to \nBetaferon (\"immediate treatment group\") or to placebo (\"delayed treatment group\"). Patients and \ninvestigators remained blinded to the initial treatment allocation. \n \nTable 3: Primary efficacy results of the BENEFIT and the BENEFIT Follow-up study \n \n\n Year 2 results \nPlacebo-controlled \n\nphase \n\nYear 3 results \nOpen-label follow-up \n\nYear 5 results \nOpen-label follow-up \n\n Betaferon \n250 mcg \n\n \nn=292 \n\nPlacebo \n \n\nn=176 \n\nImme-\ndiate \n\nBetaferon \n250 mcg \n\n \nn=292 \n\nDelayed \nBetaferon \n250 mcg \n\n \nn=176 \n\nImme-\ndiate \n\nBetaferon \n250 mcg \n\n \nn=292 \n\nDelayed \nBetaferon \n250 mcg \n\n \nn=176 \n\nNumber of patients \ncompleted the trial \nphase  \n\n \n271 (93%) \n\n \n166 (94%) \n\n \n249 (85%) \n\n \n143 (81%) \n\n \n235 (80%) \n\n \n123 (70%) \n\nPrimary efficacy variables \n\nTime to CDMS \n\nKaplan-Meier \nestimates \n\n28% 45% 37% 51% 46% 57% \n\n\n\n15 \n\nRisk reduction \n \n\nHazard ratio with \n95% confidence \ninterval \n\nlog-rank test \n\n47% versus placebo \n \n\nHR = 0.53 [0.39, 0.73] \n \n\np < 0.0001 \n \nBetaferon prolonged \nthe time to CDMS by \n363 days, from 255 \ndays in the placebo \ngroup to 618 days in \nthe Betaferon group \n(based on the 25th \npercentiles) \n\n41% versus delayed \nBetaferon \n\nHR = 0.59 [0.42, 0.83] \n \n\np = 0.0011 \n\n37% versus delayed \nBetaferon \n\nHR = 0.63 [0.48, 0.83] \n \n\np = 0.0027 \n\nTime to McDonald MS  \n\nKaplan-Meier \nestimates \n\n69% 85% No primary endpoint No primary endpoint \n\nRisk reduction \n \n\nHazard ratio with \n95% confidence \ninterval \n\nlog-rank test \n\n43% versus placebo \n \n\nHR = 0.57 [0.46, 0.71] \n \n\np < 0.00001 \n\n  \n\nTime to confirmed EDSS progression \n\nKaplan-Meier \nestimates \n\nNo primary endpoint 16% 24% 25% 29% \n\nRisk reduction \n \n\nHazard ratio with \n95% confidence \ninterval \n\nlog-rank test \n\n40% versus delayed \nBetaferon \n\nHR = 0.60 [0.39, 0.92] \n \n\np = 0.022 \n\n24% versus delayed \nBetaferon \n\nHR = 0.76 [0.52, 1.11] \n \n\np=0.177 \n\n \nIn the placebo-controlled phase, Betaferon delayed the progression from the first clinical event to \nCDMS in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner. The robustness of the treatment \neffect was also shown by the delay of progression to multiple sclerosis according to McDonald criteria \n(Table 3).  \n \nSubgroup analyses according to baseline factors demonstrated evidence of efficacy on progression to \nCDMS in all subgroups evaluated. The risk for progression to CDMS within 2 years was higher in \nmonofocal patients with at least 9 T2-lesions or Gd-enhancement on brain MRI at baseline. In \nmultifocal patients, the risk for CDMS was independent from MRI findings at baseline, indicating a \nhigh risk for CDMS because of the dissemination of the disease based on clinical findings.  For the \ntime being there is no well-established definition of a high risk patient, although a more conservative \napproach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at least one new T2 \nor one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the initial scan. In \nany case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTherapy with Betaferon was well accepted as indicated by a high rate of trial completion (93% in the \nBetaferon group). To increase tolerability of Betaferon, a dose titration was applied and non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs were administered at start of therapy. Moreover, an autoinjector was used by \nthe majority of patients throughout the study. \n \nIn the open-label follow-up phase, the treatment effect on CDMS was still evident after 3 and 5 years \n(Table 3) even though the majority of patients from the placebo-group were treated with Betaferon at \nleast from the second year onwards. EDSS progression (confirmed increase in EDSS of at least one \npoint compared to baseline) was lower in the immediate treatment group (Table 3, significant effect \nafter 3 years, no significant effect after 5 years). The majority of patients in both treatment groups had \nno disability progression over the 5-year period. Robust evidence for benefit on this outcome \nparameter could not be demonstrated for 'immediate' treatment. No benefit, attributable to immediate \nBetaferon treatment, in quality of life (as measured by FAMS - Functional Assessment of MS: \nTreatment Outcomes Index) was seen. \n \nRR-MS, SP-MS and single clinical event suggestive of MS \nBetaferon was effective in all multiple sclerosis studies to reduce disease activity (acute inflammation \nin the central nervous system and permanent tissue alterations) as measured by magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI). The relation of multiple sclerosis disease activity as measured by MRI and clinical \noutcome is currently not fully understood. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nBetaferon serum levels were followed in patients and volunteers by means of a not completely specific \nbioassay. Maximum serum levels of about 40 IU/ml were found 1-8 hours after subcutaneous injection \nof 500 microgram (16.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. From various studies mean clearance rates and \nhalf-lives of disposition phases from serum were estimated to be at most 30 ml·min-1·kg-1 and 5 hours, \nrespectively.  \n \nBetaferon injections given every other day do not lead to serum level increases, and the \npharmacokinetics does not seem to change during therapy. \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered interferon beta-1b was approximately \n50%. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNo acute toxicity studies have been carried out. As rodents do not react to human interferon beta, \nrepeated dose studies were carried out with rhesus monkeys. Transitory hyperthermia was observed, as \nwell as a significant rise in lymphocytes and a significant decrease in thrombocytes and segmented \nneutrophils.  \n \nNo long-term studies have been conducted. Reproduction studies with rhesus monkeys revealed \nmaternal toxicity and an increased rate of abortion, resulting in prenatal mortality. No malformations \nhave been observed in the surviving animals.  \nNo investigations on fertility have been conducted. No influence on the monkey oestrous cycle has \nbeen observed. Experience with other interferons suggests a potential for impairment of male and \nfemale fertility. \n \nIn one single genotoxicity study (Ames test), no mutagenic effect has been observed. Carcinogenicity \nstudies have not been performed. An in vitro cell transformation test gave no indication of tumorigenic \npotential.  \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n Annex – self injection procedure \n \n \n1. What Betaferon is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Betaferon is \n \nBetaferon is a type of medicine known as interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis. Interferons are \nproteins produced by the body that help fight against attacks on the immune system such as viral \ninfections. \n \nHow Betaferon works \n \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), \nparticularly the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. In MS, inflammation destroys the protective \nsheath (called myelin) around the nerves of the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This \nis called demyelination. \nThe exact cause of MS is unknown. An abnormal response by the body's immune system is thought to \nplay an important part in the process which damages the CNS.  \n \nThe damage to the CNS can occur within an MS attack (relapse). It can cause disability temporarily, \nsuch as difficulty walking. Symptoms may disappear completely or partly. \nInterferon beta-1b has been shown to change the response of the immune system and to help to reduce \ndisease activity. \n \nHow Betaferon helps fight your disease \n \nSingle clinical event indicating a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis: Betaferon has been \nshown to delay progression to definite multiple sclerosis. \n \nRelapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: People with relapsing-remitting MS have occasional attacks \nor relapses during which symptoms become noticeably worse. Betaferon has been shown to cut down \nthe number of attacks and make them less severe. It reduces the number of hospital stays due to the \ndisease and prolongs the time without relapses. \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nSecondary progressive multiple sclerosis: In some cases people with relapsing-remitting MS find \nthat their symptoms increase and they progress to another form of MS called secondary progressive \nMS. With this, people find themselves becoming increasingly impaired, whether or not they have \nrelapses. Betaferon can reduce the number and severity of the attacks, and slow the progression of \ndisability. \n \nWhat Betaferon is used for \n \nBetaferon is for use in patients  \n \n► who have experienced symptoms for the first time which indicate a high risk of developing \n\nmultiple sclerosis. Your doctor will rule out any other reasons which could explain these \nsymptoms before you are treated. \n\n \n► who suffer from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least two relapses within \n\nthe last two years. \n \n► who suffer from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease shown by \n\nrelapses.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Betaferon \n \nDo not use Betaferon \n \n- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or \n\nany of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n- if you currently suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts (see ‘Warnings and \n\nprecautions’ and section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). \n- if you have severe liver disease (see ‘Warnings and precautions’, ‘Other medicines and \n\nBetaferon’ and section 4 ‘Possible side effects’). \n \n\n► Tell your doctor if any of the above applies to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor before you start using Betaferon: \n \n− If you have monoclonal gammopathy. This is a disorder of the immune system where an \n\nabnormal protein is found in the blood. Problems with your small blood vessels (capillaries) \nmay develop when using medicines like Betaferon (systemic capillary leak syndrome). This can \nlead to shock (collapse) and even be fatal. \n\n \n− If you have had depression or are depressed or previously had thoughts of suicide. Your \n\ndoctor will closely monitor you during treatment. If your depression and/or suicidal thoughts are \nsevere, you will not be prescribed Betaferon (see also ‘Do not use Betaferon’). \n\n \n− If you have ever had seizures or if you are taking medicines to treat epilepsy (anti-\n\nepileptics), your doctor will monitor your treatment carefully (see also ‘Other medicines and \nBetaferon’ and section 4. ‘Possible side effects’). \n\n \n− If you have severe kidney problems your doctor may monitor your kidney function during \n\ntreatment. \n \nYour doctor also needs to know the following whilst you are using Betaferon: \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n− If you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face \nand/or your tongue or sudden shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of a serious \nallergic reaction (hypersensitivity), which may become life threatening. \n\n \n− If you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Betaferon, or if \n\nyou develop thoughts of suicide. If you become depressed while you are on Betaferon, you \nmay need special treatment and your doctor will closely monitor you and may also consider \nstopping your treatment. If you suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts, you will \nnot be treated with Betaferon (see also ‘Do not use Betaferon’). \n\n \n− If you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be \n\ncatching a lot of infections. These may be symptoms of a fall in your blood cell count or in the \nnumber of platelets in your blood (cells, which help the blood to clot). You may need extra \nmonitoring by your doctor. \n\n \n− If you have loss of appetite, fatigue, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, especially if \n\nyou notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes, or easy \nbruising. These symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. Changes to the liver function \nvalues occurred in patients treated with Betaferon during clinical studies. As for other beta \ninterferons, severe liver damage, including cases of liver failure, have been reported rarely in \npatients taking Betaferon. The most serious were reported in patients taking other medicines or \nwho were suffering from diseases that can affect the liver (e.g. alcohol abuse, severe infection). \n\n \n− If you experience symptoms like irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or legs, \n\nor shortness of breath. This may suggest a disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) \nwhich has been reported rarely in patients using Betaferon. \n\n \n− If you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or \n\nhave a fever. This may suggest an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which has been \nreported with Betaferon use. This is often associated with an increase of certain blood fats \n(triglycerides). \n\n \n► Stop using Betaferon and tell your doctor immediately if any of these happens to you.  \n\n \nOther things to consider when using Betaferon \n \n− You will need blood tests to measure the number of your blood cells, blood chemistry and your \n\nliver enzymes. This will be done before you start using Betaferon, regularly after treatment \nwith Betaferon has been initiated and periodically whilst you are on it, even if you have no \nparticular symptoms. These blood tests will be in addition to the tests, which are normally done \nto monitor your MS. \n\n \n− If you have a heart disease, the flu-like symptoms, which often occur at the start of \n\ntreatment, may prove stressful to you. Betaferon must be used with caution, and your doctor \nwill monitor you for worsening of your heart condition, particularly during the start of \ntreatment. Betaferon itself does not affect the heart directly. \n\n \n− You will have a check of the function of your thyroid gland, regularly or whenever thought \n\nnecessary by your doctor for other reasons. \n \n− Betaferon contains human albumin and therefore carries a potential risk for transmission \n\nof viral diseases. A risk of transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be ruled out. \n \n− During treatment with Betaferon your body may produce substances called neutralising \n\nantibodies, which may react with Betaferon (neutralising activity). It is not yet clear whether \nthese neutralising antibodies reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Neutralising antibodies \n\n\n\n48 \n\nare not produced in all patients. Currently it is not possible to predict which patients belong to \nthis group. \n\n \n− During treatment with Betaferon, kidney problems that may reduce your kidney function, \n\nincluding scarring (glomerulosclerosis), may occur. Your doctor may perform tests to check \nyour kidney function. \n\n \n− Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots \n\ncould affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting \nBetaferon. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the \nfunction of your kidney. \n\n \n− Paleness, yellow skin or dark-colored urine, possibly accompanied by unusual dizziness, \n\ntiredness or shortness of breath may occur during your treatment. These may be symptoms \nof a breakdown of red blood cells. This might happen several weeks to several years after \nstarting Betaferon. Your doctor may perform blood tests. Inform your doctor about other \nmedicines that you are taking at the same time as Betaferon. \n \n\nInjection site reactions \n \nDuring Betaferon treatment you are likely to experience injection site reactions. Symptoms \ninclude redness, swelling, change in the skin colour, inflammation, pain and hypersensitivity.  Skin \nbreakdown and tissue damage (necrosis) around the injection site are reported less frequently. \nInjection site reactions usually become less frequent over time. \n \nInjection site skin and tissue breakdown can result in scars forming. If this is severe a doctor may have \nto remove foreign matter and dead tissue (debridement) and, less often, skin grafting is required and \nhealing may take up to 6 months. \n \nTo reduce the risk of getting injection site reactions you must: \n− use a sterile (aseptic) injection technique, \n− rotate the injection sites with each injection (see Annex ‘Self-injection procedure’, Part II, in the \n\nsecond part of this leaflet). \n \n\nInjection site reactions may occur less frequently, if you use an auto-injector device. Your doctor or \nnurse can tell you more about this. \n \nIf you experience any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or fluid leaking \nout from the injection site:  \n \n\n► Stop injections with Betaferon and talk to your doctor \n \n\n► If you have only one sore injection site (lesion) and the tissue damage (necrosis) is not \ntoo extensive you may continue using Betaferon.  \n\n \n► If you have more than one sore injection site (multiple lesions) you must stop using \n\nBetaferon until your skin has healed. \n \nYour doctor will regularly check the way you inject yourself, particularly if you have experienced \ninjection site reactions. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThere have been no formal clinical trials undertaken in children or adolescents. \nHowever, there is some data available in children and adolescents from 12 to 16 years. This data \nsuggests that the safety profile from this age is the same as in adults for use of Betaferon 8.0 million \n\n\n\n49 \n\nIU under the skin every other day. There is no information on the use of Betaferon in children under \n12 years of age. Therefore Betaferon should not be used in this population. \n \nOther medicines and Betaferon \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n  \nNo formal interaction studies have been carried out to find out whether Betaferon affects other \nmedicines or is affected by them.  \n \nUsing Betaferon with other medicines that modify the immune system response is not recommended, \nexcept anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids or the adrenocorticotropic hormone \n(ACTH). \n \nBetaferon should be used with caution with: \n- medicines which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome P450 system) for \n\ntheir removal from the body, for example medicines used to treat epilepsy (like phenytoin).  \n- medicines which affect the production of blood cells. \n \nBetaferon with food and drink \n \nBetaferon is injected under the skin so any food or drink you consume is not thought to have any \neffect on Betaferon. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\nNo harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Betaferon can be used during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nBetaferon may cause side effects in the central nervous system (see section 4. ‘Possible side effects’). \nIf you are especially sensitive, this might affect your ability to drive or use machines. \n \nBetaferon contains mannitol, human albumin and sodium \n \nThe inactive ingredients of Betaferon include  \n\n• small amounts of mannitol, a naturally occurring sugar and human albumin, a protein. \n• Sodium - this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say \n\nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \nIf you know that you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the ingredients or if you become so, you \nmust not use Betaferon. \n \n \n3. How to use Betaferon \n \nTreatment with Betaferon should be started under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in \nthe treatment of multiple sclerosis. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nThe recommended dose is:  \n \nEvery other day (once every two days), 1.0 ml of the prepared Betaferon solution (see Annex ‘Self-\ninjection procedure’ in the second part of this leaflet) injected under the skin (subcutaneously). This \nequals 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. \n \nWhen starting treatment with Betaferon, it is tolerated best by gradually increasing the dose, i.e. \nstarting with just 0.25 ml of the medication and then increasing, after every 3rd injection, first to \n0.5 ml, then to 0.75 ml and then finally to the full dose (1 ml) of Betaferon.  \nYour doctor may decide, together with you, to change the time interval between increases in the dose \ndepending on side effects you may experience at the start of treatment. To easily increase the dosage \nduring the first 12 injections, you may be given a special titration pack, containing four differently \ncoloured packs with specially marked syringes and with detailed instructions on the separate \nintroductory leaflet for titration pack. \n \nPreparing the injection \n \nBefore injection, the Betaferon solution has to be prepared from a vial of Betaferon powder and \n1.2 ml of liquid from the pre-filled solvent syringe. This will either be done by your doctor or nurse or \nby yourself after you have been carefully trained. For details how the Betaferon solution for injection \nis prepared see Annex ‘Self-injection procedure’, Part I.   \n\nDetailed instructions for self-injection of Betaferon under the skin are provided in Part IE of the \nAnnex ’Self-injection procedure’.   \nThe injection site must be changed regularly. See section 2. ’Warnings and precautions’ and follow \nthe instructions in Part II ‘Rotating injection sites’ and Part III (Betaferon Medication Record) of the \nAnnex ’Self-injection procedure’. \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nAt present it is not known how long treatment with Betaferon should last. The length of treatment \nwill be decided by your doctor together with you. \n \nIf you use more Betaferon than you should \n \nGiving many times the dose of Betaferon recommended for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not \nled to life-threatening situations. \n \n\n► Talk to your doctor if you injected too much Betaferon or injected it too often. \n \nIf you forget to use Betaferon \n \nIf you have forgotten to give yourself an injection at the right time do it as soon as you remember and \nthen follow on with the next one 48 hours later. \n \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten single dose. \n \nIf you stop using Betaferon \n \nTalk to your doctor if you stop or wish to stop treatment. Stopping Betaferon is not known to lead to \nacute withdrawal symptoms. \n \n\n► If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist \nor nurse. \n\n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nBetaferon may cause serious side effects. If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side \neffects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n\n► Tell your doctor immediately and stop using Betaferon: \n \n− if you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face and/or \n\nyour tongue or sudden shortness of breath. \n \n− if you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Betaferon, or if \n\nyou develop thoughts of suicide. \n \n− if you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be \n\ncatching a lot of infections. \n \n− if you have loss of appetite, fatigue, feeling sick , repeated vomiting, especially if you notice \n\nwidespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes, or easy bruising. \n \n− if you experience symptoms like irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or legs, \n\nor shortness of breath. \n \n− if you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or have \n\na fever. \n \n\n► Tell your doctor immediately: \n \n\n− if you get some or all of these symptoms: foamy urine, fatigue, swelling, particularly in the \nankles and eyelids, and weight gain, as they may be signs of a possible kidney problem. \n\n \nAt the beginning of treatment side effects are common but in general they become less with further \ntreatment.  \n \nThe most frequently observed side effects are:  \n \n\n► Flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, painful joints, malaise, sweating, headache, \nor muscular pain. These symptoms may be reduced by taking paracetamol or non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen. \n\n \n► Injection site reactions. Symptoms can be redness, swelling, discolouration, \n\ninflammation, pain, hypersensitivity, tissue damage (necrosis). See ‘Warnings and \nprecautions’ in section 2 for more information and what to do, if you experience an \ninjection site reaction. These may be reduced by the use of an auto-injector device. \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for further information. \n\n \nTo reduce side effects at the start of treatment, your doctor should start you on a low dose of Betaferon \nand increase it gradually (see section 3. ‘How to use Betaferon’). \n \nThe following side effects listing is based on reports from clinical trials with Betaferon (list 1) \nand from side effects reported on the marketed product (list 2). \n \nList 1: Very common side effects which have occurred in clinical trials with Betaferon(at least 10% of \nthe cases) and at a higher percentage than those observed with placebo.

You will best tolerate Betaferon in the \nbeginning if you start with a low dose and gradually increase to the full standard dose (see first part of \nthis leaflet, section 3. ‘How to use Betaferon’). To easily increase the dosage during the first 12 \ninjections, you may be given a special titration pack, containing four differently coloured triple packs \nwith special marked syringes and with detailed instructions on the separate introductory leaflet for \ntitration pack. The syringes in this titration pack are marked accordingly with the appropriate doses \n(0.25; 0.5; 0.75 or 1.0 ml). \n \nThe following instructions and pictures explain how to prepare Betaferon for injection and how to \ninject Betaferon yourself. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your \ndoctor or nurse will help you to learn the process of self-administration. Do not attempt to inject \nyourself until you are sure that you understand how to prepare the injection solution and give the \ninjection to yourself.  \n \nPART I: STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS \n \nThe instructions include the following main steps: \n \nA) General advice \nB) Getting ready to inject \nC) Reconstituting the solution, step by step \nD) Drawing up the injection \nE) Making the injection \nF) Quick review of the process \n \n \nA) General advice \n \n► Get a good start! \n \nYou will find that within a few weeks your treatment will become a natural part of your routine. As \nyou get started, you may find the following helpful: \n \n− Set up a permanent storage area in a convenient location out of the sight and reach of children \n\nso your Betaferon and other supplies are always easy to find. \nFor details on storage conditions, see section 5. ‘How to store Betaferon’ in the first part of this \nleaflet. \n\n \n− Try to give your injection at the same time of day. This makes it easier to remember and easier \n\nto plan a block of time when you will not be interrupted. \n \n− Prepare each dose only when you are ready for an injection. After mixing Betaferon, you should \n\ngive the injection immediately (if Betaferon is not used immediately, see section 5. ‘How to \nstore Betaferon’ in the first part of this leaflet). \n\n \n► Important tips to keep in mind \n \n− Be consistent - use Betaferon as described in section 3. ‘How to use Betaferon’ in the first part \n\nof this leaflet. Always double-check your dosage. \n− Keep your syringes and syringe disposal unit out of the sight and reach of children; lock the \n\nsupplies away if possible. \n− Never re-use syringes or needles. \n− Always use a sterile (aseptic) technique as described in here. \n− Always place the used syringes in the proper disposal unit. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nB) Getting ready to inject \n \n► Choosing an injection site \n \nBefore preparing your injection, decide where you are going to inject. You should inject Betaferon \ninto the fatty layer between the skin and muscle (that is, subcutaneously, about 8 to 12 mm under the \nskin). The best places for injections are where the skin is loose and soft, and away from joints, nerves, \nor bones, for example the abdomen, arm, thigh or buttocks.  \n \nImportant: Do not use any area where you can feel lumps, bumps, firm knots, pain or an area that is \ndiscoloured, indented, scabbed, or where the skin is broken. Talk to your doctor or nurse about these \nor any other unusual conditions you may find. \n \nYou should rotate the injection site at every injection. If some areas are too difficult for you to reach, \nyou may need a family member or friend to help you with these injections. Follow the sequence \ndescribed in the schedule at the end of the Annex (see Part II, ‘Rotating injection sites’) and you will \ncome back to your first injection site area after 8 injections (16 days). This will give each injection site \na chance to fully recover before receiving another injection.  \n \nPlease refer to the rotation schedule at the end of this Annex to learn how to choose an injection site. \nAn example of a medication record is also included (see Annex Part III). This should give you an idea \nof how you can keep track of your injection sites and dates. \n \n► Checking the content of the pack \n \nIn the Betaferon pack you will find: \n− 1 Betaferon vial (with powder for solution for injection), \n− 1 pre-filled syringe of solvent for Betaferon (sodium chloride solution 5.4 mg/ml (0.54% w/v)), \n− 1 vial adapter with a pre-attached needle, \n− 2 alcohol swabs to clean the skin and vial. \nIn addition you will need a disposal unit for used syringes and needles. \nFor skin disinfection use an appropriate disinfectant. \nIf you have a Betaferon titration pack you will find 4 differently coloured and numbered triple packs, \neach containing: \n\n• 3 Betaferon vials (with powder for solution for injection) \n• 3 pre-filled syringes with solvent for the Betaferon powder (sodium chloride solution 5.4 mg/ml \n\n(0.54% w/v)) \n• 3 vial adapters with a pre-attached needle \n• 6 alcohol wipes for skin and vial cleaning \n\nIn addition you will need a disposal unit for used syringes and needles. \nFor skin disinfection use an appropriate disinfectant. \n \nStart with the yellow triple pack 1 containing 3 syringes with a 0.25-ml marking, for treatment days \n1, 3 and 5. \nUse then the red triple pack 2 containing 3 syringes with a 0.5-ml marking, for treatment days 7, 9 \nand 11. \nContinue with the green triple pack 3 containing 3 syringes with a 0.75-ml marking, for treatment \ndays 13, 15 and 17. \nUse the blue triple pack 4 containing 3 syringes with a 0.25; 0.5; 0.75 and 1.0-ml marking, for \ntreatment days 19, 21 and 23. \n\n\n\n59 \n\nC) Reconstituting the solution, step by step \n \n\n \n\n1 - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before \nbeginning this process. \n\n \n\n \n2 - Open the Betaferon vial and put it on the table. It is best to \nuse your thumb rather than your nail as it could break. \n \n\n \n\n \n3 - Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe, moving the \nwipe in one direction only. Leave the wipe on top of the vial. \n \n\n \n\n \n4 – Open the blister pack containing the vial adapter, but leave \nthe vial adapter inside.  \n \nDo not remove the vial adapter from the blister pack at this \nstage. \n \nDo not touch the vial adapter. This is to keep it sterile. \n \n\n \n\n5 – Before attaching the adapter remove and discard the alcohol \nwipe and rest the vial on a flat surface. \n  \n \n6 - Hold the blister pack on the outside and place it on top of the \nvial. Push it down firmly until you feel it snap into place on the \nvial. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n7 - Remove the blister pack from the vial adapter, holding the \nblister edges. Now you are ready to attach the pre-filled solvent \nsyringe to the vial adapter. \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n8 - Pick up the syringe. Be sure that the orange tip cap is firmly \nattached to the solvent syringe! \nRemove the tip cap by twisting it off. Throw away the tip cap.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n9 - Connect the syringe to the opening on the side of the vial \nadapter by inserting the end of the syringe and tightening \ncarefully with a clockwise “push and twist” motion (see arrow). \nThis will form the syringe assembly.  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n10 - Hold the syringe assembly at the bottom of the vial. Slowly \npush the plunger of the syringe in all the way to transfer all of \nthe solvent into the vial. Release the plunger, which may go \nback to its original position.  \nThis applies also to the titration pack. \n \n\n \n\n \n11 - With the syringe assembly still attached, swirl the vial \naround gently to completely dissolve the dry Betaferon powder. \n \nDo not shake the vial. \n\n \n\n \n12 - Examine the solution carefully. It should be clear and \ncontain no particles. If the solution is discoloured or contains \nparticles, discard it and start again with a new single pack of \nsupplies. If foam is present –- which can happen if the vial is \nshaken or swirled too much – let the vial sit undisturbed until the \nfoam settles. \n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n\nD)  Drawing up the injection \n \n\n \n \n\n \n13 - If the plunger has moved back to its original position push it \nin again and hold it in place. To prepare your injection, turn the \nassembly over so that the vial is on top, cap side pointing down. \nDoing this allows the solution to flow down into the syringe. \nKeep the syringe horizontal.  \nSlowly pull the plunger back to withdraw all the solution out of \nthe vial and into the syringe. \n \nWith the titration pack, withdraw solution only up to the mark \non the syringe: \n0.25 ml for first three injections (at day 1, 3, 5 of therapy), or \n0.5 ml for the injections at day 7, 9, 11 of therapy, or \n0.75 ml for the injections at day 13, 15, 17 of therapy. \n\nDiscard the vial with any remaining solution. \n \nFrom day 19 you are injecting the full dose 1.0 ml. \n \n\n \n\n14 - After drawing up the solution turn the syringe assembly so \nthat the needle is pointing up. This allows any air bubbles to rise \nto the top of the solution. \n \n15 - Remove any air bubbles by gently tapping the syringe and \npushing the plunger to the 1-ml mark, or to the volume \nprescribed by your doctor. \nIf you are injecting less than 1 ml with the titration pack there \nmight not be any air bubbles, however for full dose injection \nsome air bubbles might turn up. Remove them by gently tapping \nthe syringe and pushing the plunger to the respective marking on \nthe syringe. \n \nIf too much solution enters the vial along with the air bubbles, \nget back into the horizontal position (see pict. 13) and pull the \nplunger back a little to withdraw the solution back into the \nsyringe. \n\n \n \n\n \n16 - Next, hold the blue vial adapter with the attached vial and \nremove it from the syringe by twisting it and then pulling it \ndown, away from the syringe.  \n \nOnly hold the blue plastic adapter when removing. Keep the \nsyringe in a horizontal position and the vial below the \nsyringe. \n \nRemoving the vial and adapter from the syringe ensures that the \nsolution will flow out from the needle when injected. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n62 \n\n17 - Dispose of the vial and any unused portion of the solution in the disposal unit \n \n18 - You are now ready to inject.  \n \nIf, for some reason, you are not able to inject the Betaferon immediately, you can keep the \nreconstituted solution in the syringe in a refrigerator for up to 3 hours before using. Do not freeze the \nsolution, and do not wait longer than 3 hours to inject it. If more than 3 hours pass, discard the \nreconstituted Betaferon solution and prepare a new injection. When you use the solution, warm it up \nin your hands before injecting to avoid pain. \n \n\n \nE)  Making the injection \n \n\n 1 - Choose an area for the injection (see advice at the start and the \ndiagrams at the end of this Annex), and make a note of it in your \nmedication record. \n \n \n\n \n\n2 - Use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site. Let the \nskin air-dry. Throw the wipe away. \nFor skin disinfection use an appropriate disinfectant. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n3 - Remove the cap from the needle by pulling not twisting it. \n\n \n\n \n4 - Gently pinch the skin together around the disinfected injection site \n(to raise it up a little). \n \n5 - Holding the syringe like a pencil or a dart, push the needle straight \ninto the skin at a 90˚ angle with a quick, firm motion. Please note: \nBetaferon can also be administered with an auto-injector. \n \n6 - Inject the medicine using a slow, steady push on the plunger. (Push \nthe plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty.) \n\n  \n7- Discard the syringe in the disposal unit. \n\n \n \nF) Quick review of the process \n \n\n- Take out the required content for one injection \n- Attach vial adapter to the vial \n- Connect the syringe to the vial adapter \n- Push syringe plunger to transfer all the solvent into the vial \n- Turn the syringe assembly over and draw up the prescribed amount of the solution \n- Remove vial from syringe - you are now ready to inject. \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \nNOTE: The injection should be administered immediately after mixing (if the injection is delayed, \nrefrigerate the solution and inject it within 3 hours). Do not freeze.  \n \nPART II: ROTATING INJECTION SITES \n \nYou need to choose a new site for each injection to allow the area time to recover and help prevent \ninfection. Advice on which areas to choose is given in the first part of this Annex. It is a good idea to \nknow where you plan to inject before you prepare your syringe. The schedule shown in the diagram \nbelow will help you to vary the sites appropriately. For example, give the first injection into the right \nside of the abdomen, choose the left side for the second injection, then move to the right thigh for the \nthird, and so on through the diagram until all suitable areas of the body have been used. Keep a record \nof where and when you last gave yourself an injection. One way to do that is to note the injection site \non the enclosed medication record card. \n \nBy following this schedule, you will come back to your first area (e.g. the right side of the abdomen) \nafter 8 injections (16 days). This is called a Rotation Cycle. On our example schedule each area is split \nagain into 6 injection sites (which adds up to 48 injection sites all together), left and right: upper, \nmiddle and lower part of each area. If you come back to an area after one Rotation Cycle, choose the \nmost distant injection site within this area. If an area becomes sore, talk to your doctor or nurse about \nchoosing other injection sites. \n \nRotation Schedule:  \n \nTo help you rotate the injection sites appropriately, we recommend that you keep a record of the date \nand location of your injection. You can use the following rotation schedule.  \n \nWork through each rotation cycle in turn. Each cycle will be 8 injections (16 days), given in area 1 \nthrough to area 8 in turn. By following this sequence, you will give each area a chance to recover \nbefore receiving another injection.  \n \nRotation Cycle 1: Upper left section of each area \n \nRotation Cycle 2: Lower right section of each area \n \nRotation Cycle 3: Middle left section of each area \n \nRotation Cycle 4: Upper right section of each area \n \nRotation Cycle 5: Lower left section of each area \n \nRotation Cycle 6:  Middle right section of each area \n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \nROTATION SCHEDULE: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n AREA 1 \n\n AREA 3 \n\n AREA 5 \n\n AREA 2 \n\n AREA 4 \n\n AREA 6 \n\n AREA 8  AREA 7 \n\n10 – 15 cm \nfrom groin \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \nPART III: BETAFERON MEDICATION RECORD \n \nInstructions for keeping track of your injection sites and dates \n \n- Select an injection site for your first injection. \n- Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe and let it air-dry. \n- After your injection, fill in the used injection site and date on the table in your injection record \n\n(see the example: ‘Keeping track of your injection sites and dates’). \n \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \nEXAMPLE OF A MEDICATION RECORD: \n \n\n \n \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \nSeparate Annex: INTRODUCTORY LEAFLET FOR TITRATION PACK \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Betaferon to treat your MS. You will best tolerate Betaferon in the \nbeginning if you start with a low dose and gradually increase to the full standard dose (see first part of \nthe package leaflet, section 3. ‘How to use Betaferon’). The syringes in this titration pack are marked \naccordingly with the appropriate doses (0.25; 0.5; 0.75 or 1.0 ml). \n \n \n► Checking the content of the pack \n \nYou will find in the Betaferon titration pack 4 differently coloured and numbered triple packs, each \ncontaining: \n\n• 3 Betaferon vials (with powder for solution for injection) \n• 3 pre-filled syringes with solvent for the Betaferon powder (sodium chloride solution 5.4 mg/ml \n\n(0.54% w/v)) \n• 3 vial adapters with a pre-attached needle \n• 6 alcohol wipes for skin and vial cleaning \n\n Each triple pack contains the syringes you will require for preparing each dose. The syringes \nhave special markings for this dose. Please follow in detail the instructions for use below. For \neach titration step use the complete amount of solvent for reconstitution of the Betaferon \npowder, then draw up the required dose into the syringe. \n\n \nStart by using the yellow triple pack which is clearly marked with a “1” on the top right hand \nside of the box.  \nThis first triple pack should be used for treatment days 1, 3 and 5.  \nIt contains specially marked syringes with 0.25 ml marking. This will help you to inject the \nrequired dose only. \n \nAfter finishing with the yellow pack, start using the red triple pack which is clearly marked with \na \"2\" on the top right hand side of the box. \nThis second triple pack should be used for treatment days 7, 9 and 11. \nIt contains specially marked syringes with 0.50 ml marking. This will help you to inject the \nrequired dose only.  \n \nAfter finishing with the red pack, start using the green triple pack which is clearly marked with a \n\"3\" on the top right hand side of the box \nThis third triple pack should be used for treatment days 13, 15 and 17. \nIt contains specially marked syringes with 0.75 ml marking. This will help you to inject the \nrequired dose only.  \n \nFinally, after finishing with the green pack, start using the blue triple pack which is clearly \nmarked with a \"4\" on the top right hand side of the box. This last triple pack should be used for \ntreatment days 19, 21 and 23. \nIt contains syringes with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 ml markings. With triple pack “4” you can inject \nthe full dose 1.0 ml.  \n \n \n\n \nFor a description of how to prepare and use the Betaferon powder, please refer to section 3. ‘How to \nuse Betaferon’ in the first part of the package leaflet and to the Annex 'Self-injection procedure' in the \nsecond part of the package leaflet.  \n \nIn addition you will need a disposal unit for used syringes and needles. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
