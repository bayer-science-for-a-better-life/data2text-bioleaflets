NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nKalydeco 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of ivacaftor. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach film-coated tablet contains 167.2 mg of lactose (as monohydrate) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n \nLight blue, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets, printed with “V 150” in black ink on one side and plain \non the other (16.5 mm x 8.4 mm in modified tablet shape). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKalydeco tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and \nolder and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of the following gating \n(class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, \nS549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nKalydeco tablets are also indicated for the treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with cystic \nfibrosis (CF) who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nKalydeco tablets are also indicated in a combination regimen with tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg \ntablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) \nwho are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and \nhave one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, \nD579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and \n3849+10kbC→T. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. \nIf the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be \nperformed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in the CFTR gene \n(see section 4.1). The phase of the poly-T variant identified with the R117H mutation should be \ndetermined in accordance with local clinical recommendations. \n \nPosology \n \nKalydeco monotherapy in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older and weighing \n25 kg or more \nThe recommended dose is one Kalydeco 150 mg tablet taken orally every 12 hours (300 mg total daily \ndose) with fat-containing food (see Method of administration). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nKalydeco in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in adults and adolescents aged 12 years \nand older \nThe recommended dose is one tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg tablet taken in the morning and one \nKalydeco 150 mg tablet taken in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart with fat-containing food \n(see Method of administration).  \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should be told to take it as \nsoon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If more than 6 hours have \npassed since the time the dose is usually taken, the patient should be told to wait until the next \nscheduled dose. \n \nPatients receiving Kalydeco in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor should be told not to take more \nthan one dose of either tablet at the same time. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \nKalydeco monotherapy \n \nWhen co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A, the Kalydeco dose should be reduced to \n150 mg twice a week (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A, the Kalydeco dose should be reduced to \n150 mg once daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nKalydeco in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \nWhen co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A, the Kalydeco evening dose should not be \nadministered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). One tablet of tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg should be \ntaken twice a week, taken approximately 3 to 4 days apart.  \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A, the dose of Kalydeco and \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor should be adjusted according to the recommendations in Table 1 (see section 4.4 \nand 4.5). \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations for concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors \n\n Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4* \nMorning Dose \n\nTezacaftor 100 mg/ ivacaftor 150 mg tablet  -  - \nIvacaftor 150 mg tablet -  -  \n\nEvening Dose \nIvacaftor 150 mg tablet - - - - \n\n* Continue dosing with tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg or ivacaftor 150 mg tablets on alternate days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nVery limited data are available for elderly patients treated with ivacaftor (administered as monotherapy \nor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor). No dose adjustment is considered necessary \nunless moderate hepatic impairment exists. Caution is recommended for patients with severe renal \nimpairment or end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to \n30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). For \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the dose should be reduced (see \nTable 2). There is no experience of the use of Kalydeco monotherapy or in combination with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, its use is not recommended \nunless the benefits outweigh the risks (see Table 2 and sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nTable 2: Dosing recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment for Kalydeco \n\nmonotherapy and in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n\n Kalydeco monotherapy Kalydeco in a combination regimen \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor \n\nMild  \n(Child-Pugh Class A) \n\nNo dose adjustment No dose adjustment \n\nModerate  \n(Child-Pugh Class B) \n\nOne tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg \nonce daily  \n\nOne tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily \n\nSevere  \n(Child-Pugh Class C) \n\nStarting dose: One tablet of \nivacaftor 150 mg every other \nday. \nDosing intervals should be \nmodified according to clinical \nresponse and tolerability. \n\nStarting dose: One tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once daily.  \nDosing intervals should be modified \naccording to clinical response and \ntolerability. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kalydeco monotherapy in children aged less than 6 months with a gating \n(class III) mutation have not been established. No data are available. \n \nAn appropriate dose for children under 6 years of age and weighing less than 25 kg cannot be achieved \nwith Kalydeco tablets. \n \nThe efficacy of Kalydeco monotherapy in patients less than 18 years of age with an R117H mutation in \nthe CFTR gene has not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.4, 4.8 and \n5.1, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Kalydeco in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children \naged less than 12 years have not been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, \nor broken before swallowing. \n \nKalydeco tablets should be taken with fat-containing food. \n \nFood or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided during treatment (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOnly patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, \nS549N, S549R gating (class III), G970R or R117H mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene \nwere included in studies 1, 2, 5 and 6 (see section 5.1). \n \nIn study 5, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change \nin the sweat chloride test was < 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant \nimprovement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R \nmutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy results from a Phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of \nivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of Kalydeco monotherapy in \nthese patients is not recommended. \n \nEfficacy was not demonstrated in patients aged 6 to 11 years with CF who have an R117H mutation \nwhile only two adolescent patients were enrolled in study 6 (see section 5.1). \n \nLess evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with an R117H-7T mutation \nassociated with less severe disease (see section 5.1). Whenever possible the phase of the poly-T variant \nidentified with the R117H mutation should be determined as this may be informative in considering \ntreatment of patients with an R117H mutation (see section 4.2). \n \nKalydeco in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor should not be prescribed in patients with CF who \nare heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have a second CFTR mutation not listed in section 4.1. \n \nEffect on liver function tests \n \nModerate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are \ncommon in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated \nwith ivacaftor monotherapy and in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Therefore, liver \nfunction tests are recommended for all patients prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the \nfirst year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all patients with a history of transaminase \nelevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. In the event of \nsignificant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT or AST > 5 x the upper limit of normal \n(ULN), or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN), dosing should be interrupted and \nlaboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution of transaminase \nelevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nUse of ivacaftor, either in monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, is not \nrecommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are expected to outweigh \nthe risks (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended while using ivacaftor, either in monotherapy or in a combination regimen \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor, in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nIvacaftor, either in monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, has not been \nstudied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted \npatients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with ciclosporin or tacrolimus. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nCYP3A inducers \nExposure to ivacaftor may be reduced by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially \nresulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy. Therefore, co-administration of Kalydeco (monotherapy or in \ncombination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \nThe dose of Kalydeco (monotherapy or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) must be adjusted \nwhen used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nCataracts \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric \npatients treated with ivacaftor, either in monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use \nand exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment cannot be excluded. Baseline and \nfollow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating ivacaftor \ntreatment, either in monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nLactose content \n \nKalydeco contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIvacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp and a \npotential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for P-gp.   \n \nMedicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor \n \nCYP3A inducers \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure \n(AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. \nCo-administration of Kalydeco (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor) with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when Kalydeco (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.  \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \nIvacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and \nincreased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the Kalydeco dose (as monotherapy or in \na combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is recommended for co-administration with strong \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin and \nclarithromycin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by \n3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the Kalydeco dose (as \nmonotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is recommended for patients \ntaking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole and erythromycin (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that \nmoderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit or \nSeville oranges should be avoided during treatment with Kalydeco (as monotherapy or in a \ncombination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, see section 4.2). \n \nCiprofloxacin \nCo-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose \nadjustment is required when Kalydeco (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor) is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. \n \nMedicinal products affected by ivacaftor: \n \nAdministration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive \nsubstrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic \neffect and adverse reactions. \n \nCYP2C9 substrates \nIvacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is \nrecommended during co-administration of warfarin with Kalydeco (as monotherapy or in a \ncombination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor). Other medicinal products for which exposure may be \nincreased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution. \n \nDigoxin and other P-gp substrates \nCo-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, \nconsistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of Kalydeco (as monotherapy or \nin a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) may increase systemic exposure of medicinal \nproducts that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect \nand adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a \nnarrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or tacrolimus, caution and \nappropriate monitoring should be used. \n \nCYP3A substrates  \nCo-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure \n1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A \nsubstrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are \nco-administered with ivacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor).  \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nIvacaftor (as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) has been studied \nwith an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no significant effect on the \nexposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is necessary. \n \nPotential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its \nmetabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood \n\n\n\n8 \n\nof being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of \nivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be \nclinically relevant.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in \npregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nKalydeco during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ivacaftor and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of ivacaftor into the milk of lactating female \nrats. As such, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Kalydeco therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on \nfertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKalydeco has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness \n(see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use \nmachines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older who received \nivacaftor in the pooled 48-week placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies that occurred with an incidence of \nat least 3% and up to 9% higher than in the placebo arm were headache (23.9%), oropharyngeal pain \n(22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), nasal congestion (20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), \nnasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), dizziness (9.2%), rash (12.8%) and bacteria in sputum \n(12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 12.8% of ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nIn patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion \n(26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and \nbacteria in sputum (11.8%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions in patients who received ivacaftor included abdominal pain and transaminase \nelevations (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 3 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor monotherapy in clinical trials (placebo-\ncontrolled and uncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks \nto 144 weeks. Additional adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in combination with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor are also provided in Table 3. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as \nfollows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions in patients treated with ivacaftor monotherapy or in combination \n\nwith tezacaftor \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \nvery common \n\nNasopharyngitis very common \nRhinitis common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache very common \nDizziness very common \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Ear pain common \nEar discomfort common \nTinnitus common \nTympanic membrane \nhyperaemia \n\ncommon \n\nVestibular disorder common \nEar congestion uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nOropharyngeal pain very common \nNasal congestion very common \nSinus congestion common \nPharyngeal erythema common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain very common \nDiarrhoea very common \nNausea * common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminase elevations very common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash very common \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nBreast mass common \nBreast inflammation uncommon \nGynaecomastia uncommon \nNipple disorder uncommon \nNipple pain uncommon \n\nInvestigations Bacteria in sputum very common \n* Adverse reaction and frequency reported only in clinical studies with ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nTransaminase elevations \nDuring the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 1 and 2 of ivacaftor monotherapy in patients aged \n6 years and older, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5 or > 3 x ULN was \n3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% in ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated \npatients, respectively. Two patients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor permanently discontinued \ntreatment for elevated transaminases, each > 8 x ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a \ntransaminase elevation > 3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN. In \n\n\n\n10 \n\nivacaftor-treated patients, most transaminase elevations up to 5 x ULN resolved without treatment \ninterruption. Ivacaftor dosing was interrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations > 5 x \nULN. In all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently \nresumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). \n \nDuring the placebo controlled Phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks) of ivacaftor in a combination regimen \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5, or > 3 x \nULN were similar between tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and placebo-treated \npatients; 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in tezacaftor/ivacaftor in combination with ivacaftor-treated patients, \nand 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in placebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients \n(0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. No patients treated \nwith tezacaftor/ivacaftor discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety data of ivacaftor monotherapy were evaluated in 11 patients between 6 months to less than \n12 months of age, 19 patients between 12 months to less than 24 months of age, 34 patients between 2 \nto less than 6 years of age, 61 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between \n12 to less than 18 years of age. The safety data of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \nwas evaluated in 98 patients between 12 to less than 18 years of age. \n \nThe safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric patients aged 6 months and older and adult \npatients. \n \nDuring the 24-week open-label Phase 3 clinical study of ivacaftor monotherapy in 34 patients aged 2 \nto less than 6 years (study 7), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or \nAST) > 3 x ULN was 14.7% (5/34). All 5 patients had maximum ALT or AST levels > 8 x ULN, \nwhich returned to baseline levels following interruption of dosing with ivacaftor granules. Ivacaftor \nwas permanently discontinued in one patient. In children aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of \npatients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) > 3 x ULN was 15.0% (6/40) in \nivacaftor-treated patients and 14.6% (6/41) in patients who received placebo. A single ivacaftor-treated \npatient (2.5%) in this age range had an elevation of ALT and AST > 8 x ULN. Peak LFT (ALT or \nAST) elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. In almost all \ninstances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, \nivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive \nrechallenge were observed. \n \nDuring the 24-week, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study of ivacaftor in patients aged less than \n24 months (study 8), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) \n> 3, > 5, and > 8 x ULN in the cohort of patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months was 27.8% \n(5/18), 11.1% (2/18) and 11.1% (2/18), respectively. In the cohort of patients aged 6 months to less \nthan 12 months one patient (9.1%) had elevated ALT of > 3 to ≤5 x ULN. No patients had elevations \nin total bilirubin or discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations in either cohort. \nThe two patients with elevations of ALT or AST > 8 x ULN interrupted treatment and subsequently \nresumed ivacaftor successfully (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose consists of general \nsupportive measures including monitoring of vital signs, liver function tests and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIvacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to \nenhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced \nchannel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. Ivacaftor also potentiated the channel-open \nprobability of R117H-CFTR, which has both low channel-open probability (gating) and reduced \nchannel current amplitude (conductance). The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect resulting in \nlittle-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in subjects with \nthis mutation in study 5 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy data). \n \nIn vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from \nrodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic \nresponse (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate \nthe gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely \nelucidated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIvacaftor monotherapy \nIn studies 1 and 2 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to \nrapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 \nwas -48 mmol/L [95% CI -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI -62, -47], respectively) and sustained \n(through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration. \n \nIn study 5, part 1 in patients who had a non-G551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with \nivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride \nof -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the \nG970R-CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 \n(6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit \n(4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending \nto pre-treatment levels. \n \nIn study 6 in patients aged 6 years or older with CF who had an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene, \nthe treatment difference in mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through 24 weeks of \ntreatment was -24 mmol/L (95% CI -28, -20). \n \nIvacaftor in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \nIn patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, the treatment difference between ivacaftor in \ncombination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat \nchloride through week 24, was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8). \n \nIn patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual \nCFTR activity, the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride \n\n\n\n12 \n\nthrough week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3) between ivacaftor in combination with \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo, and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3) between ivacaftor and placebo. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nKalydeco monotherapy \n \nStudy 1 and 2: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations \nThe efficacy of Kalydeco has been evaluated in two Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D \nmutation in the CFTR gene on at least 1 allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted. \n \nPatients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every \n12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., \ntobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted. \n \nStudy 1 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the \nF508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used \nsome medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medications included \ndornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% versus \n33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was \n63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years). \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was \n30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean \npredicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); \n8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less \nthan 70% predicted at baseline. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. \n \nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in study \n1 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 2. The treatment difference between ivacaftor and \nplacebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through \nweek 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 1 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 2. The mean change from \nbaseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo \ngroup in study 1 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 2. In both \nstudies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks. \n \nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 1 was \n11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the \nmean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients \nwith baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 2 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6). \n \nThe results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Effect of ivacaftor on other efficacy endpoints in studies 1 and 2 \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-Rb respiratory domain score (points)c \nThrough week 24 8.1 < 0.0001 6.1 0.1092 \n\n\n\n13 \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\n(4.7, 11.4) (-1.4, 13.5) \n\nThrough week 48 8.6 \n(5.3, 11.9) \n\n< 0.0001 5.1 \n(-1.6, 11.8) \n\n0.1354 \n\nRelative risk of pulmonary exacerbation \nThrough week 24 0.40d 0.0016 NA NA \nThrough week 48 0.46d 0.0012 NA NA \nMean absolute change from baseline in body weight (kg) \nAt week 24 2.8 \n\n(1.8, 3.7) \n< 0.0001 1.9 \n\n(0.9, 2.9) \n0.0004 \n\nAt week 48 2.7 \n(1.3, 4.1) \n\n0.0001 2.8 \n(1.3, 4.2) \n\n0.0002 \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in BMI (kg/m2) \nAt week 24 0.94 \n\n(0.62, 1.26) \n< 0.0001 0.81 \n\n(0.34, 1.28) \n0.0008 \n\nAt week 48 0.93 \n(0.48, 1.38) \n\n< 0.0001 1.09 \n(0.51, 1.67) \n\n0.0003 \n\nMean change from baseline in z-scores \nWeight-for-age z-score at \nweek 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.04, 0.62) \n\n0.0260 0.39 \n(0.24, 0.53) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nBMI-for-age z-score at \nweek 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.002, 0.65) \n\n0.0490 0.45 \n(0.26, 0.65) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nCI: confidence interval; NA: not analysed due to low incidence of events \na Treatment difference = effect of ivacaftor – effect of placebo \nb CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised is a disease-specific, health-related quality-of-life measure for CF. \nc Study 1 data were pooled from CFQ-R for adults/adolescents and CFQ-R for children 12 to 13 years of age; Study 2 data \n\nwere obtained from CFQ-R for children 6 to 11 years of age. \nd Hazard ratio for time to first pulmonary exacerbation \ne In subjects under 20 years of age (CDC growth charts) \n \nStudy 5: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations \nStudy 5 was a Phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study \n(part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or non-G551D gating \nmutation in the CFTR gene (G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D). \n \nIn part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours \nwith fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to \nthe other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled \nhypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for \n16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients \nrandomised to part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to \npart 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence. \n \nThirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% \npredicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the \nF508del-CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per \ntreatment sequence). \n \nIn part 1 of study 5, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was \n79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value \nwas 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in \npercent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the \n\n\n\n14 \n\nplacebo period. The observed treatment difference (95% CI) between ivacaftor and placebo was 10.7% \n(7.3, 14.1) (P < 0.0001). \n \nThe effect of ivacaftor in the overall population of study 5 (including the secondary endpoints absolute \nchange in BMI at 8 weeks of treatment and absolute change in the respiratory domain score of the \nCFQ-R through 8 weeks of treatment) and by individual mutation (absolute change in sweat chloride \nand in percent predicted FEV1 at week 8) is shown in Table 5. Based on clinical (percent predicted \nFEV1) and pharmacodynamic (sweat chloride) responses to ivacaftor, efficacy in patients with the \nG970R mutation could not be established. \n \nTable 5: Effect of ivacaftor for efficacy variables in the overall population and for specific CFTR \n\nmutations \n\nAbsolute change in percent \npredicted FEV1 \n\nBMI \n(kg/m2) \n\nCFQ-R respiratory domain \nscore (points) \n\nThrough week 8 At week 8 Through week 8 \nAll patients (N = 39) \nResults shown as mean (95% CI) change from baseline ivacaftor vs placebo-treated patients: \n\n10.7 (7.3, 14.1) 0.66 (0.34, 0.99) 9.6 (4.5, 14.7) \nPatients grouped under mutation types (n) \nResults shown as mean (minimum, maximum) change from baseline for ivacaftor-treated patients at \nweek 8*: \nMutation (n) \n \n\nAbsolute change in sweat chloride \n(mmol/L) \n\nAbsolute change in percent predicted \nFEV1 (percentage points) \n\nAt week 8 At week 8 \nG1244E (5) \nG1349D (2) \nG178R (5) \nG551S (2) \nG970R# (4) \nS1251N (8) \nS1255P (2) \nS549N (6) \nS549R (4) \n\n‑55 (-75, -34) \n-80 (-82, -79) \n-53 (-65, -35) \n\n-68† \n-6 (-16, -2) \n-54 (-84, -7) \n-78 (-82, -74) \n-74 (-93, -53) \n\n-61†† (-71, -54) \n\n8 (-1, 18) \n20 (3, 36) \n8 (-1, 18) \n\n3† \n3 (-1, 5) \n\n9 (-20, 21) \n3 (-1, 8) \n\n11 (-2, 20) \n5 (-3, 13) \n\n* Statistical testing was not performed due to small numbers for individual mutations. \n† Reflects results from the one patient with the G551S mutation with data at the 8-week time point. \n†† n = 3 for the analysis of absolute change in sweat chloride. \n# Causes a splicing defect resulting in little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface \n \nIn part 2 of study 5, the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 following 16 weeks \n(patients randomised to the ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence in part 1) of continuous ivacaftor \ntreatment was 10.4% (13.2%). At the follow-up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the \nmean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For \npatients randomised to the placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in part 1 there was a further mean \n(SD) change of 3.3% (9.3%) in percent predicted FEV1 after the additional 16 weeks of treatment with \nivacaftor. At the follow up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%). \n \nStudy 3: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene \nStudy 3 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group \nPhase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF age 12 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% \npredicted. \n \nThe mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy \nendpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo \n\n\n\n15 \n\ngroup. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points \n(95% CI -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). \n \nStudy 4: open-label extension study \nIn study 4 patients who completed treatment in studies 1 and 2 with placebo were switched to ivacaftor \nwhile patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length of \ntreatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at least \n144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nOne hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 1 were rolled over in study 4, 67 in the \nplacebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 2 \nwere rolled over in study 4, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nTable 6 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups \nof patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of \nstudy 4 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 1 and 2. \n \nTable 6: Effect of ivacaftor on percent predicted FEV1 in study 4 \n\nOriginal study and \ntreatment group \n\nDuration of ivacaftor \ntreatment (weeks) \n\nAbsolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 (percentage points) \n\n  N Mean (SD) \nStudy 1 \n\nIvacaftor 48* 77 9.4 (8.3) \n 144 72 9.4 (10.8) \n\nPlacebo 0* 67 -1.2 (7.8)† \n 96 55 9.5 (11.2) \nStudy 2 \n\nIvacaftor 48* 26 10.2 (15.7) \n 144 25 10.3 (12.4) \n\nPlacebo 0* 22 -0.6 (10.1)† \n 96 21 10.5 (11.5) \n\n* Treatment occurred during blinded, controlled, 48-week Phase 3 study. \n† Change from prior study baseline after 48 weeks of placebo treatment. \n \nWhen the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 4 baseline for \npatients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 1, the mean (SD) absolute \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \n(n = 25) who rolled over from study 2 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the \nivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 \nthrough week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional \nimprovements in study 4 (week 48 through week 144). \n \nFor patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary \nexacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than \nduring the subsequent study 4 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \nfrom study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 4, the rate of annualised \npulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across \nweeks 48 to 96. \n \nFor patients who rolled over from study 2 the number of events was, overall, low. \n \nStudy 6: study in patients with CF with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene \n\n\n\n16 \n\nStudy 6 evaluated 69 patients who were 6 years of age or older; 53 (76.8%) patients had the F508del \nmutation in the second allele. The confirmed R117H poly-T variant was 5T in 38 patients and 7T in \n16 patients. At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was 73% (range: 32.5% to 105.5%) and mean age was \n31 years (range: 6 to 68 years). The mean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent \npredicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and \n0.46 percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus \nplacebo was 2.1 percentage points (95% CI -1.1, 5.4). \n \nA pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted in patients 18 years and older (26 patients on placebo \nand 24 on ivacaftor). Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in a mean absolute change in percent predicted \nFEV1 through week 24 of 4.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus -0.46 percentage points \nin the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.0 \npercentage points (95% CI 1.1, 8.8). \n \nIn a subgroup analysis in patients 6 to 11 years of age (8 patients on placebo and 9 patients on \nivacaftor), the placebo group showed an improvement in mean percent predicted FEV1 from 94.0% at \nbaseline to 98.4% post-baseline; the ivacaftor group showed a slight decline in mean FEV1 from \n97.5% at baseline to 96.2% overall post-baseline. The mean absolute change from baseline through \nweek 24 in percent predicted FEV1 was -2.8 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and \n3.5 percentage points in the placebo group. The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo \nwas -6.3 percentage points (95% CI -12.0, -0.7). No statistical analysis was conducted for subjects \n12 to 17 years of age because only 2 patients were enrolled in this study. \n \nIn a subgroup analysis in patients with a confirmed R117H-5T genetic variant, the difference in the \nmean absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 between ivacaftor and \nplacebo was 5.3% (95% CI 1.3, 9.3). In patients with a confirmed R117H-7T genetic variant, the \ntreatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo was 0.2% (95% CI -8.1, 8.5). \n \nSecondary efficacy variables included absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through \n24 weeks of treatment, absolute change from baseline in BMI at 24 weeks of treatment, absolute \nchange in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score through 24 weeks of treatment and time to first \npulmonary exacerbation. No treatment differences for ivacaftor versus placebo were observed except \nfor the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R (the treatment difference through 24 weeks of ivacaftor \nversus placebo was 8.4 [95% CI 2.2, 14.6] points) and for the mean change from baseline in sweat \nchloride (see Pharmacodynamic effects). \n \nKalydeco in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor \nThe efficacy and safety of Kalydeco in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients \nwith CF was assessed in two clinical studies; a 24 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudy with 504 patients aged 12 years and older who were homozygous for the F508del mutation; and \na randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and ivacaftor controlled, 2 period, 3 treatment, 8-week \ncrossover study with 244 patients aged 12 years and older who were heterozygous for the F508del \nmutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity. An open-label, rollover, \n96 week study is on-going to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the combination regimen in \nboth patient populations. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor for \nadditional data. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nAfter oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) \nfor AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every \n12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an \naccumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally \nincreased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. The exposure of ivacaftor \nincreased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when given with food containing fat. The AUC of ivacaftor \nwhen given in combination with tezacaftor increased approximately 3-fold when given with fat \ncontaining food. Ivacaftor, administered as monotherapy or in combination with tezacaftor, should be \nadministered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in \nthe fed state. \n \nIvacaftor granules (2 x 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with \nfat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for the \ngranules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. The \neffect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules. \n \nDistribution \n \nIvacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and \nalbumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. After oral administration of \nivacaftor150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) \napparent volume of distribution was 353 (122) L. \n \nAfter oral administration of ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in combination with tezacaftor 100 mg \nonce daily in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (± SD) for apparent volume of distribution of \nivacaftor was 206 (82.9) L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIvacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. \nM1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. \nM6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. \n \nThe effect of the potentially reduced activity of CYP3A4 in patients carrying the CYP3A4*22 variant \non ivacaftor exposure is not known. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated \nin the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for \napproximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible \nurinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately \n12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was \nsimilar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (± SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was \n17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. \n \nAfter oral administration of ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours in combination with tezacaftor 100 mg \nonce daily in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (± SD) for apparent clearance of ivacaftor was \n15.7 (6.38) L/h. After steady-state dosing of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor in CF patients, \nthe mean (SD) terminal half-life of ivacaftor was approximately 9.3 (1.7) hours.  \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from \n25 mg to 250 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nFollowing a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic \nfunction (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 735 \n[331] ng/mL) but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16800 \n[6140] ng*hr/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for \npredicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dosage from \n150 mg q12h to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable \nsteady-state Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic \nimpairment. Based on these results, a modified regimen of Kalydeco monotherapy is recommended for \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (see Table 2 in section 4.2).  \n \nFollowing multiple doses of ivacaftor and tezacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired \nhepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had a 50% increase in ivacaftor AUC, and an \napproximate 36% and 10% increase in AUC and Cmax for tezacaftor, respectively. Based on these \nresults, a modified regimen for Kalydeco in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor is \nrecommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see Table 2 in section 4.2). \n \nThe impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics \nof ivacaftor monotherapy or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor have not been studied. The \nmagnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be higher than that \nobserved in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The use of Kalydeco monotherapy or in \ncombination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with severe hepatic impairment is therefore not \nrecommended unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment, \neither as monotherapy or in a combination regimen with tezacaftor/ivacaftor. In a human \npharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor monotherapy, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its \nmetabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). There was negligible \nurinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a single oral dose of \n500 mg).  \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended when administering ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in combination with tezacaftor, \nto patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or \nend-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRace \nRace had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white \n(n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis. \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor, either as monotherapy or in combination with tezacaftor, \nare similar in males and females. \n \nElderly \nClinical studies of ivacaftor monotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years \nand older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in younger \nadults. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nClinical studies of ivacaftor in combination regimen with tezacaftor did not include patients over \n75 years of age. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor in the \nelderly patients (65-72 years) are comparable to those in younger adults.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPredicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in Phase 2 and 3 studies as \ndetermined using population PK analysis is presented by age group in Table 7. \n \nTable 7: Mean (SD) ivacaftor exposure by age group \n\nAge group Dose Cmin, ss (ng/mL) \nAUCτ, ss \n\n(ng*h/mL) \n\n6 months to less than 12 months \n(5 kg to < 7 kg) * 25 mg q12h 336 5410 \n\n6 months to less than 12 months \n(7 kg to < 14 kg) 50 mg q12h 508 (252) 9140 (4200) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months \n(7 kg to < 14 kg) \n\n50 mg q12h 440 (212) 9050 (3050) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months \n(≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) \n\n75 mg q12h 451 (125) 9600 (1800) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds \n(< 14 kg) \n\n50 mg q12h 577 (317) 10500 (4260) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds \n(≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) \n\n75 mg q12h 629 (296) 11300 (3820) \n\n6-  to 11-year-olds † \n(≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) \n\n75 mg q12h 641 (329) 10760 (4470) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † \n(≥ 25 kg) \n\n150 mg q12h 958 (546) 15300 (7340) \n\n12- to 17-year-olds 150 mg q12h 564 (242) 9240 (3420) \n\nAdults (≥ 18 years old) 150 mg q12h 701 (317) 10700 (4100) \n* Values based on data from a single patient; standard deviation not reported. \n†\n Exposures in 6- to 11-year-olds are predictions based on simulations from the population PK model using data obtained \n\nfor this age group. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor in combination with tezacaftor in adolescent patients \n(12 to 17 year-olds) are comparable to those in adults (see Table 8). \n \nTable 8: Mean (SD) of ivacaftor exposure when used in combination with tezacaftor, by age \n\ngroup \n\nAge group Dose Ivacaftor Mean (SD) Cmin, ss (ng/mL) \nIvacaftor Mean (SD) \nAUCτ,ss (ng*h/mL) \n\n12- to 17-year-olds \nn = 97 \n\ntezacaftor 100 mg qd / \nivacaftor 150 mg q12h \n\n700 (413) 11400 (5500) \n\nAdults (≥ 18 years old) \nn = 389 \n\ntezacaftor 100 mg qd / \nivacaftor 150 mg q12h \n\n738 (318) 11400 (4140) \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPregnancy and fertility \n \nIvacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall \nfertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant \nreductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average \nlitter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The \nNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of \napproximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as \nivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \nPlacental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nPeri- and post-natal development \n \nIvacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The \nNOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of approximately 3 times \nthe systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in \nadult humans at the MRHD.  \n \nJuvenile animal studies \n \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor \nexposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites \nwhen administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived \nfrom rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through \nmilk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with \nivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nGranules in sachet \n \nWhite to off-white granules approximately 2 mm in diameter. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nKalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of infants aged at least 6 months, toddlers and \nchildren weighing 5 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of the following \ngating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, \nS1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nKalydeco should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. \nIf the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be \nperformed before starting treatment to confirm the presence of an indicated mutation in at least one \nallele of the CFTR gene (see section 4.1). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nPosology \n \nInfants aged at least 6 months, toddlers, children, adolescents and adults should be dosed according to \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 months and older \n\nWeight Dose Total daily dose \n≥5 kg to < 7 kg 25 mg granules taken orally every \n\n12 hours with fat-containing food \n50 mg \n\n≥ 7 kg to < 14 kg 50 mg granules taken orally every \n12 hours with fat-containing food \n\n100 mg \n\n≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg 75 mg granules taken orally every \n12 hours with fat-containing food \n\n150 mg \n\n≥ 25 kg See Kalydeco tablets SmPC for further details. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should be told to take it as \nsoon as possible and then take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If more than 6 hours have \npassed since the time the dose is usually taken, the patient should be told to wait until the next \nscheduled dose. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \nWhen co-administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A, the Kalydeco dose should be reduced to one \nsachet (ivacaftor 25 mg for patients 5 kg to < 7 kg; ivacaftor 50 mg for patients 7 kg to < 14 kg; \nivacaftor 75 mg for patients 14 kg to < 25 kg) twice a week (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A, the Kalydeco dose is as above \nrecommended, but administered once daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to \n30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). For \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), a reduced dose of one sachet \n(ivacaftor 25 mg for patients 5 kg to < 7 kg; ivacaftor 50 mg for patients 7 kg to < 14 kg; ivacaftor \n75 mg for patients 14 kg to < 25 kg) once daily is recommended. There is no experience of the use of \nKalydeco in patients with severe hepatic impairment; therefore, its use is not recommended unless the \nbenefits outweigh the risks. In such cases, the starting dose should be as above recommended, but \nadministered every other day. Dosing intervals should be modified according to clinical response and \ntolerability (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Kalydeco in children aged less than 6 months have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. \n \nEach sachet is for single use only. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nEach sachet of granules should be mixed with 5 mL of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and \ncompletely and immediately consumed. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. If not \nimmediately consumed, the mixture has been shown to be stable for one hour and therefore should be \ningested during this period. A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or just \nafter dosing. \n \nFood or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided during treatment (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nOnly patients with CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N \nor S549R gating (class III) or G970R mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene were included in \nstudies 1, 2, 5 and 7 (see section 5.1). \n \nIn study 5, four patients with the G970R mutation were included. In three of four patients the change \nin the sweat chloride test was < 5 mmol/L and this group did not demonstrate a clinically relevant \nimprovement in FEV1 after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy in patients with the G970R \nmutation of the CFTR gene could not be established (see section 5.1). \n \nEfficacy results from a Phase 2 study in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del \nmutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in FEV1 over 16 weeks of \nivacaftor treatment compared to placebo (see section 5.1). Therefore, use of Kalydeco monotherapy in \nthese patients is not recommended. \n \nEffect on liver function tests \n \nModerate transaminase (alanine transaminase [ALT] or aspartate transaminase [AST]) elevations are \ncommon in subjects with CF. Transaminase elevations have been observed in some patients treated \nwith ivacaftor monotherapy. Therefore, liver function tests are recommended for all patients prior to \ninitiating ivacaftor, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For all \npatients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests \nshould be considered. In the event of significant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT \nor AST > 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with bilirubin > 2 x ULN), \ndosing should be interrupted and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. \nFollowing resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should \nbe considered (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nUse of ivacaftor is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment unless the benefits are \nexpected to outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). No safety data are available in infants aged 6 \nto less than 12 months of age with moderate or severe hepatic impairment treated with ivacaftor. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended while using ivacaftor in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage \nrenal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nIvacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. \nTherefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with \nciclosporin or tacrolimus. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nCYP3A inducers  \nExposure to ivacaftor may be reduced by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially \nresulting in the loss of ivacaftor efficacy. Therefore, co-administration of Kalydeco with strong \nCYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCYP3A inhibitors  \nThe dose of Kalydeco must be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A \ninhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). No safety data are available in infants aged 6 to less than \n12 months of age who are treated with ivacaftor and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. \n \nCataracts \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric \npatients treated with ivacaftor. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as \ncorticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment cannot be \nexcluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric \npatients initiating ivacaftor treatment. \n \nLactose content \n \nKalydeco contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nIvacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp and a \npotential inhibitor of CYP2C9. In vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for P-gp.   \n \nMedicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor \n \nCYP3A inducers \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ivacaftor exposure \n(AUC) by 89% and decreased hydroxymethyl ivacaftor (M1) to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. \nCo-administration of Kalydeco with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampicin, rifabutin, \nphenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not \nrecommended (see section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended when Kalydeco is used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers.  \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \nIvacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor, increased ivacaftor exposure (measured as area under the curve [AUC]) by 8.5-fold and \nincreased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the Kalydeco dose is recommended for \n\n\n\n27 \n\nco-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, \nvoriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by \n3-fold and increased M1 to a lesser extent than ivacaftor. A reduction of the Kalydeco dose is \nrecommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole and \nerythromycin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nCo-administration of ivacaftor with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that \nmoderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure to ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit or \nSeville oranges should be avoided during treatment with Kalydeco (see section 4.2). \n \nCiprofloxacin \nCo-administration of ciprofloxacin with ivacaftor did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor. No dose \nadjustment is required when Kalydeco is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. \n \nMedicinal products affected by ivacaftor \n \nAdministration of ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive \nsubstrates of CYP2C9, and/or P-gp, and/or CYP3A which may increase or prolong their therapeutic \neffect and adverse reactions. \n \nCYP2C9 substrates \nIvacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) is \nrecommended during co-administration of warfarin with Kalydeco. Other medicinal products for \nwhich exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should \nbe used with caution. \n \nDigoxin and other P-gp substrates \nCo-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, \nconsistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of Kalydeco may increase \nsystemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or \nprolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other \nsubstrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus or \ntacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. \n \nCYP3A substrates  \nCo-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure \n1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. No dose adjustment of CYP3A \nsubstrates, such as midazolam, alprazolam, diazepam or triazolam, is required when these are co-\nadministered with ivacaftor.  \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nIvacaftor has been studied with an oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptive and was found to have no \nsignificant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. Therefore, no dose adjustment of oral \ncontraceptives is necessary. \n \nPotential for ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Ivacaftor and its \nmetabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood \nof being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of \nivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be \nclinically relevant.  \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ivacaftor in \npregnant women. Animals studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable avoid the use of \nKalydeco during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether ivacaftor and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of ivacaftor into the milk of lactating female \nrats. As such, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to \ndiscontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Kalydeco therapy taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on \nfertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nKalydeco has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Ivacaftor may cause dizziness \n(see section 4.8) and, therefore, patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use \nmachines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 6 years and older who received \nivacaftor in the pooled 48-week placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies that occurred with an incidence of \nat least 3% and up to 9% higher than in the placebo arm were headache (23.9%), oropharyngeal pain \n(22.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.0%), nasal congestion (20.2%), abdominal pain (15.6%), \nnasopharyngitis (14.7%), diarrhoea (12.8%), dizziness (9.2%), rash (12.8%) and bacteria in sputum \n(12.8%). Transaminase elevations occurred in 12.8% of ivacaftor-treated patients versus 11.5% of \nplacebo-treated patients. \n \nIn patients aged 2 to less than 6 years the most common adverse reactions were nasal congestion \n(26.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (23.5%), transaminase elevations (14.7%), rash (11.8%), and \nbacteria in sputum (11.8%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions in patients who received ivacaftor included abdominal pain and transaminase \nelevations (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 2 reflects the adverse reactions observed with ivacaftor in clinical trials (placebo-controlled and \nuncontrolled studies) in which the length of exposure to ivacaftor ranged from 16 weeks to 144 weeks. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not \n\n\n\n29 \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse \nreactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions in ivacaftor-treated patients aged 6 months and older \n\nSystem organ class Adverse reactions Frequency  \nInfections and infestations Upper respiratory tract \n\ninfection \nvery common \n\nNasopharyngitis very common \nRhinitis  common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache very common \nDizziness very common \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders Ear pain common \nEar discomfort common \nTinnitus common \nTympanic membrane \nhyperaemia \n\ncommon \n\nVestibular disorder common \nEar congestion uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nOropharyngeal pain very common \nNasal congestion very common \nSinus congestion  common \nPharyngeal erythema common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain very common \n\nDiarrhoea very common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminase elevations very common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nRash very common \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\nBreast mass common \nBreast inflammation uncommon \nGynaecomastia uncommon \nNipple disorder uncommon \nNipple pain uncommon \n\nInvestigations Bacteria in sputum very common \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nTransaminase elevations \n \nDuring the 48-week placebo-controlled studies 1 and 2 in patients aged 6 years and older, the \nincidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) > 8, > 5 or > 3 x ULN was 3.7%, 3.7% and 8.3% \nin ivacaftor-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.9% and 8.7% in placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two \npatients, one on placebo and one on ivacaftor, permanently discontinued treatment for elevated \ntransaminases, each > 8 x ULN. No ivacaftor-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation \n> 3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN. In ivacaftor-treated patients, most \ntransaminase elevations up to 5 x ULN resolved without treatment interruption. Ivacaftor dosing was \ninterrupted in most patients with transaminase elevations > 5 x ULN. In all instances where dosing \nwas interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be \nresumed successfully (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nThe safety data of ivacaftor were evaluated in 11 patients between 6 months to less than 12 months of \nage, 19 patients between 12 months to less than 24 months of age, 34 patients between 2 to less than \n6 years of age, 61 patients between 6 to less than 12 years of age and 94 patients between 12 to less \nthan 18 years of age. \n \nThe safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric patients aged 6 months and older and adult \npatients. \n \nDuring the 24-week open-label Phase 3 clinical study of ivacaftor in 34 patients aged 2 to less than \n6 years (study 7), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) > 3 x \nULN was 14.7% (5/34). All 5 patients had maximum ALT or AST levels > 8 x ULN, which returned \nto baseline levels following interruption of dosing with ivacaftor granules. Ivacaftor was permanently \ndiscontinued in one patient. In children aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of patients \nexperiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) > 3 x ULN was 15.0% (6/40) in ivacaftor-treated \npatients and 14.6% (6/41) in patients who received placebo. A single ivacaftor-treated patient (2.5%) \nin this age range had an elevation of ALT and AST > 8 x ULN. Peak LFT (ALT or AST) elevations \nwere generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. In almost all instances where dosing \nwas interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be \nresumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive rechallenge were observed. \n \nDuring the 24-week, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study of ivacaftor in patients aged less than \n24 months (study 8), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) \n> 3, > 5, and > 8 x ULN in the cohort of patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months was 27.8% \n(5/18), 11.1% (2/18) and 11.1% (2/18), respectively. In the cohort of patients aged 6 months to less \nthan 12 months, one patient (9.1%) had elevated ALT of > 3 to ≤ 5 x ULN. No patients had elevations \nin total bilirubin. No patients discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations. Two \npatients with elevations of ALT or AST > 8 x ULN interrupted treatment and subsequently resumed \nivacaftor successfully (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific antidote is available for overdose with ivacaftor. Treatment of overdose consists of general \nsupportive measures including monitoring of vital signs, liver function tests and observation of the \nclinical status of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX02 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIvacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e., in vitro ivacaftor increases CFTR channel gating to \nenhance chloride transport in specified gating mutations (as listed in section 4.1) with reduced \nchannel-open probability compared to normal CFTR. The G970R mutation causes a splicing defect \nresulting in little-to-no CFTR protein at the cell surface which may explain the results observed in \nsubjects with this mutation in study 5 (see Pharmacodynamic effects and Clinical efficacy data).  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n31 \n\nIn vitro responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from \nrodent cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic \nresponse (e.g., sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate \nthe gating activity of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely \nelucidated. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn studies 1 and 2 in patients with the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene, ivacaftor led to \nrapid (15 days), substantial (the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 \nwas -48 mmol/L [95% CI -51, -45] and -54 mmol/L [95% CI -62, -47], respectively) and sustained \n(through 48 weeks) reductions in sweat chloride concentration. \n \nIn study 5, part 1 in patients who had a non-G551D gating mutation in the CFTR gene, treatment with \nivacaftor led to a rapid (15 days) and substantial mean change from baseline in sweat chloride \nof -49 mmol/L (95% CI -57, -41) through 8 weeks of treatment. However, in patients with the \nG970R-CFTR mutation, the mean (SD) absolute change in sweat chloride at week 8 was -6.25 \n(6.55) mmol/L. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of the study. At the 4-week follow-up visit \n(4 weeks after dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values for each group were trending \nto pre-treatment levels. \n \nIn study 7 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with a gating mutation on at least 1 allele of the CFTR \ngene administered either 50 mg or 75 mg of ivacaftor twice daily, the mean absolute change from \nbaseline in sweat chloride was -47 mmol/L (95% CI -58, -36) at week 24. \n \nIn study 8 in patients with CF aged less than 24 months, the mean absolute change from baseline in \nsweat chloride was -67.9 mmol/L (95% CI -77.6, -58.2) at week 24. Results were consistent in both \nthe 12 months to less than 24 months and 6 months to less than 12 months age cohorts. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nStudy 1 and 2: studies in patients with CF with G551D gating mutations \nThe efficacy of Kalydeco has been evaluated in two Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multi-centre studies of clinically stable patients with CF who had the G551D \nmutation in the CFTR gene on at least 1 allele and had FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted. \n \nPatients in both studies were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every \n12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies (e.g., \ntobramycin, dornase alfa). The use of inhaled hypertonic sodium chloride was not permitted. \n \nStudy 1 evaluated 161 patients who were 12 years of age or older; 122 (75.8%) patients had the \nF508del mutation in the second allele. At the start of the study, patients in the placebo group used \nsome medicinal products at a higher frequency than the ivacaftor group. These medications included \ndornase alfa (73.1% versus 65.1%), salbutamol (53.8% versus 42.2%), tobramycin (44.9% versus \n33.7%) and salmeterol/fluticasone (41.0% versus 27.7%). At baseline, mean predicted FEV1 was \n63.6% (range: 31.6% to 98.2%) and mean age was 26 years (range: 12 to 53 years). \n \nStudy 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age at screening; mean (SD) body weight was \n30.9 (8.63) kg; 42 (80.8%) patients had the F508del mutation in the second allele. At baseline, mean \npredicted FEV1 was 84.2% (range: 44.0% to 133.8%) and mean age was 9 years (range: 6 to 12 years); \n8 (30.8%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the ivacaftor group had an FEV1 less \nthan 70% predicted at baseline. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the mean absolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (8.6, 12.6) in \nstudy 1 and 12.5 percentage points (6.6, 18.3) in study 2. The treatment difference between ivacaftor \nand placebo for the mean relative change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through \nweek 24 was 17.1% (13.9, 20.2) in study 1 and 15.8% (8.4, 23.2) in study 2. The mean change from \nbaseline through week 24 in FEV1 (L) was 0.37 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.01 L in the placebo \ngroup in study 1 and 0.30 L in the ivacaftor group and 0.07 L in the placebo group in study 2. In both \nstudies, improvements in FEV1 were rapid in onset (day 15) and durable through 48 weeks. \n \nThe treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the mean absolute change (95% CI) in \npercent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study 1 was \n11.9 percentage points (5.9, 17.9). The treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo for the \nmean absolute change (95% CI) in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through week 24 in patients \nwith baseline predicted FEV1 greater than 90% in study 2 was 6.9 percentage points (-3.8, 17.6). \n \nThe results for clinically relevant secondary endpoints are shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Effect of ivacaftor on other efficacy endpoints in studies 1 and 2 \n\nEndpoint \n\nStudy 1 Study 2 \nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nTreatment \ndifferencea \n(95% CI) P value \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in CFQ-Rb respiratory domain score (points)c \nThrough week 24 8.1 \n\n(4.7, 11.4) \n< 0.0001 6.1 \n\n(-1.4, 13.5) \n0.1092 \n\nThrough week 48 8.6 \n(5.3, 11.9) \n\n< 0.0001 5.1 \n(-1.6, 11.8) \n\n0.1354 \n\nRelative risk of pulmonary exacerbation \nThrough week 24 0.40d 0.0016 NA NA \nThrough week 48 0.46d 0.0012 NA NA \nMean absolute change from baseline in body weight (kg) \nAt week 24 2.8 \n\n(1.8, 3.7) \n< 0.0001 1.9 \n\n(0.9, 2.9) \n0.0004 \n\nAt week 48 2.7 \n(1.3, 4.1) \n\n0.0001 2.8 \n(1.3, 4.2) \n\n0.0002 \n\nMean absolute change from baseline in BMI (kg/m2) \nAt week 24 0.94 \n\n(0.62, 1.26) \n< 0.0001 0.81 \n\n(0.34, 1.28) \n0.0008 \n\nAt week 48 0.93 \n(0.48, 1.38) \n\n< 0.0001 1.09 \n(0.51, 1.67) \n\n0.0003 \n\nMean change from baseline in z-scores \nWeight-for-age z-score at \nweek 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.04, 0.62) \n\n0.0260 0.39 \n(0.24, 0.53) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nBMI-for-age z-score at \nweek 48e \n\n0.33 \n(0.002, 0.65) \n\n0.0490 0.45 \n(0.26, 0.65) \n\n< 0.0001 \n\nCI: confidence interval; NA: not analysed due to low incidence of events  \na Treatment difference = effect of ivacaftor – effect of placebo \nb CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised is a disease-specific, health-related quality-of-life measure for CF. \nc Study 1 data were pooled from CFQ-R for adults/adolescents and CFQ-R for children 12 to 13 years of age; Study 2 data \n\nwere obtained from CFQ-R for children 6 to 11 years of age. \nd Hazard ratio for time to first pulmonary exacerbation \ne In subjects under 20 years of age (CDC growth charts) \n \nStudy 5: study in patients with CF with non-G551D gating mutations \n\n\n\n33 \n\nStudy 5 was a Phase 3, two-part, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study \n(part 1) followed by a 16-week open-label extension period (part 2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety \nof ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a G970R or non-G551D gating \nmutation in the CFTR gene (G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P or G1349D). \n \nIn part 1, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 150 mg of ivacaftor or placebo every 12 hours \nwith fat-containing food for 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies and crossed over to \nthe other treatment for the second 8 weeks after a 4- to 8-week washout period. The use of inhaled \nhypertonic saline was not permitted. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor as indicated in part 1 for \n16 additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor treatment was 24 weeks for patients \nrandomised to the part 1 placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for patients randomised to \npart 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence. \n \nThirty-nine patients (mean age 23 years) with baseline FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted (mean FEV1 78% \npredicted [range: 43% to 119%]) were enrolled. Sixty-two percent (24/39) of them carried the \nF508del-CFTR mutation in the second allele. A total of 36 patients continued into part 2 (18 per \ntreatment sequence). \n \nIn part 1 of study 5, the mean FEV1 percent predicted at baseline in placebo-treated patients was \n79.3% while in ivacaftor-treated patients this value was 76.4%. The mean overall post-baseline value \nwas 76.0% and 83.7%, respectively. The mean absolute change from baseline through week 8 in \npercent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 7.5% in the ivacaftor period and -3.2% in the \nplacebo period.

At the follow-up visit 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the \nmean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For \npatients randomised to the placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in part 1 there was a further mean \n(SD) change of 3.3% (9.3%) in percent predicted FEV1 after the additional 16 weeks of treatment with \nivacaftor. At the follow up visit 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) absolute \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%). \n \nStudy 3: study in patients with CF with the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene \nStudy 3 (part A) was a 16-week, 4:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group \nPhase 2 study of ivacaftor (150 mg every 12 hours) in 140 patients with CF age 12 years and older \nwho were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who had FEV1 ≥ 40% \npredicted. \n \nThe mean absolute change from baseline through week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 (primary efficacy \nendpoint) was 1.5 percentage points in the ivacaftor group and -0.2 percentage points in the placebo \ngroup. The estimated treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 1.7 percentage points (95% \nCI -0.6, 4.1); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.15). \n \nStudy 4: open-label extension study \nIn study 4, patients who completed treatment in studies 1 and 2 with placebo were switched to \nivacaftor while patients on ivacaftor continued to receive it for a minimum of 96 weeks, i.e., the length \nof treatment with ivacaftor was at least 96 weeks for patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group and at \nleast 144 weeks for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nOne hundred and forty-four (144) patients from study 1 were rolled over in study 4, 67 in the \nplacebo/ivacaftor group and 77 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-eight (48) patients from study 2 \nwere rolled over in study 4, 22 in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 26 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. \n \nTable 5 shows the results of the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for both groups \nof patients. For patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group baseline percent predicted FEV1 is that of \nstudy 4 while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group the baseline value is that of studies 1 and 2. \n \nTable 5: Effect of ivacaftor on percent predicted FEV1 in study 4 \n\nOriginal study and \ntreatment group \n\nDuration of ivacaftor \ntreatment (weeks) \n\nAbsolute change from baseline in percent \npredicted FEV1 (percentage points) \nN Mean (SD) \n\nStudy 1 \nIvacaftor 48* 77 9.4 (8.3) \n\n144 72 9.4 (10.8) \nPlacebo 0* 67 -1.2 (7.8)† \n\n96 55 9.5 (11.2) \nStudy 2 \n\n\n\n35 \n\nIvacaftor 48* 26 10.2 (15.7) \n144 25 10.3 (12.4) \n\nPlacebo 0* 22 -0.6 (10.1)† \n96 21 10.5 (11.5) \n\n* Treatment occurred during blinded, controlled, 48-week Phase 3 study. \n† Change from prior study baseline after 48 weeks of placebo treatment. \n \nWhen the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 is compared from study 4 baseline for \npatients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n = 72) who rolled over from study 1, the mean (SD) absolute \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 was 0.0% (9.05), while for patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \n(n = 25) who rolled over from study 2 this figure was 0.6% (9.1). This shows that patients in the \nivacaftor/ivacaftor group maintained the improvement seen at week 48 of the initial study (day 0 \nthrough week 48) in percent predicted FEV1 through week 144. There were no additional \nimprovements in study 4 (week 48 through week 144). \n \nFor patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group from study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary \nexacerbations was higher in the initial study when patients were on placebo (1.34 events/year) than \nduring the subsequent study 4 when patients rolled over to ivacaftor (0.48 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48, and 0.67 events/year across weeks 48 to 96). For patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group \nfrom study 1, the annualised rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 0.57 events/year across day 1 to \nweek 48 when patients were on ivacaftor. When they rolled over into study 4, the rate of annualised \npulmonary exacerbations was 0.91 events/year across day 1 to week 48 and 0.77 events/year across \nweeks 48 to 96. \n \nFor patients who rolled over from study 2 the number of events was, overall, low. \n \nStudy 7: study in paediatric patients with CF aged 2 to less than 6 years with G551D or another \ngating mutation \nThe pharmacokinetic profile, safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in 34 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years \nwith CF who had a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R \nmutation in the CFTR gene were assessed in a 24-week uncontrolled study with ivacaftor (patients \nweighing less than 14 kg received ivacaftor 50 mg and patients weighing 14 kg or more received \nivacaftor 75 mg). Ivacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food in addition \nto their prescribed CF therapies. \n \nPatients in study 7 were aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age 3 years). Twenty-six patients out of the \n34 enrolled (76.5%) had a CFTR genotype G551D/F508del with only 2 patients with a non-G551D \nmutation (S549N). The mean (SD) sweat chloride at baseline (n = 25) was 97.88 mmol/L (14.00). The \nmean (SD) Faecal Elastase-1 value at baseline (n = 27) was 28 µg/g (95). \n \nThe primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through week 24 (see section 4.8). Secondary and \nexploratory efficacy endpoints evaluated were absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride \nthrough 24 weeks of treatment, absolute change from baseline in weight, body mass index (BMI) and \nstature (supported by weight, BMI and stature z-scores) at 24 weeks of treatment, and measures of \npancreatic function such as Faecal Elastase-1. Data on percent predicted FEV1 (exploratory endpoint) \nwere available for 3 patients in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 17 patients in the 75 mg dosing group. \n \nThe mean (SD) overall (both ivacaftor dosing groups combined) absolute change from baseline in \nBMI at week 24 was 0.32 kg/m2 (0.54) and the mean (SD) overall change in BMI-for-age z-score was \n0.37 (0.42). The mean (SD) overall change in stature-for-age z-score was -0.01 (0.33). The mean (SD) \noverall change from baseline in Faecal Elastase-1 (n = 27) was 99.8 µg/g (138.4). Six patients with \ninitial levels below 200 µg/g achieved, at week 24, a level of ≥ 200 µg/g. The mean (SD) overall \nchange in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at week 24 (exploratory endpoint) was 1.8 (17.81). \n \nStudy 8: study in paediatric patients with CF aged less than 24 months \n\n\n\n36 \n\nThe pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and efficacy of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 months to \nless than 24 months were assessed in a completed cohort of patients in an on-going 24-week, \nopen-label, Phase 3 clinical study in patients aged less than 24 months (study 8). \n \nPart B of study 8 enrolled, 19 patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (mean age 15.2 months \nat baseline), with 18 patients completing the 24-week treatment period, and 11 patients aged 6 months \nto less than 12 months (mean age 9.0 months at baseline) with all 11 patients completing the 24-week \ntreatment period. Patients received ivacaftor 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg according to their weight at each \nstudy visit (see section 4.2). Ivacaftor was administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing \nfood. Patients continued on their prescribed standard-of-care CF therapies. \n \nIn part B of study 8, the primary endpoint of safety was evaluated through 24 weeks (see section 4.8). \nSecondary endpoints were evaluation of pharmacokinetics and the absolute change from baseline in \nsweat chloride through 24 weeks of treatment (see Pharmacodynamic effects). Tertiary endpoints \nincluded efficacy measures such as Faecal Elastase-1 and growth parameters. \n \n For patients aged 6 months to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, \nmean (SD) weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length z-scores are provided in Table 6. \n \nTable 6: Effect of ivacaftor on growth parameters in patients aged 6 months to less than \n\n24 months with baseline and week 24 values \n\nParameter \n\nNumber \nof \n\npatients \n\nBaseline \n \n\nAbsolute change at week 24 \n \n\nMean \n(SD) \n\nMedian \n(min, max) \n\nMean \n(SD) \n\nMedian \n(min, max) \n\nWeight–for-age z-score 29 0.34 \n(0.73) \n\n0.27 \n[-1.46, 1.79] \n\n0.23 \n(0.47) \n\n0.13 \n[-0.54, 1.63] \n\nLength-for-age z-score 28 0.10 \n(0.86)  \n\n0.15 \n[-1.45, 1.61] \n\n0.27 \n(0.94) \n\n0.44 \n[-1.81, 3.38] \n\nWeight-for-length z-score 28 0.43 \n(0.92) \n\n0.37 \n[-1.51, 2.16] \n\n0.15 \n(0.94) \n\n0.19 \n[-2.04, 2.22] \n\n \nIn patients aged 6 months to less than 24 months, with both baseline and week 24 values available, \nsixteen patients were pancreatic insufficient at baseline (defined as Faecal Elastase-1 < 200 µg/g) with \nmean (SD) Faecal Elastase-1 values at baseline and week 24 of 19.8 µg/g (23) and 248.2 µg/g (135.6), \nrespectively (mean [SD] absolute change 228.4 µg/g [136.5]). Results were consistent in both the \n12 months to less than 24 months and 6 months to less than 12 months age cohorts. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nKalydeco in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF. \n \nAfter oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (± SD) \nfor AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. After every \n12-hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an \naccumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9. \n \nAbsorption \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nFollowing multiple oral dose administrations of ivacaftor, the exposure of ivacaftor generally \nincreased with dose from 25 mg every 12 hours to 450 mg every 12 hours. The exposure of ivacaftor \nincreased approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when given with food containing fat. Ivacaftor should be \nadministered with fat-containing food. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in \nthe fed state. \n \nIvacaftor granules (2 x 75 mg sachets) had similar bioavailability as the 150 mg tablet when given with \nfat-containing food to healthy adult subjects. The geometric least squares mean ratio (90% CI) for the \ngranules relative to tablets was 0.951 (0.839, 1.08) for AUC0-∞ and 0.918 (0.750, 1.12) for Cmax. The \neffect of food on ivacaftor absorption is similar for both formulations, i.e., tablets and granules. \n \nDistribution \n \nIvacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and \nalbumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. \n \nAfter oral administration of ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days in healthy volunteers in a fed \nstate, the mean (± SD) apparent volume of distribution was 353 (122) L. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nIvacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nprimarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. \nM1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. \nM6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. \n \nThe effect of the potentially reduced activity of CYP3A4 in patients carrying the CYP3A4*22 variant \non ivacaftor exposure is not known. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing oral administration in healthy volunteers, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) was eliminated \nin the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for \napproximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible \nurinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately \n12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was \nsimilar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (±SD) CL/F for a single 150 mg dose was \n17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor are generally linear with respect to time or dose ranging from \n25 mg to 250 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nFollowing a single dose of 150 mg of ivacaftor, adult subjects with moderately impaired hepatic \nfunction (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax (mean [± SD] of 735 \n[331] ng/mL) but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ (mean [± SD] of 16800 \n[6140] ng*hr/mL) compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Simulations for \npredicting the steady-state exposure of ivacaftor showed that by reducing the dosage from \n150 mg q12h to 150 mg once daily, adults with moderate hepatic impairment would have comparable \nsteady-state Cmin values as those obtained with a dose of 150 mg q12h in adults without hepatic \nimpairment. Based on these results, a modified regimen of Kalydeco monotherapy is recommended for \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nThe impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C, score 10 to15) on the pharmacokinetics \nof ivacaftor have not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown \nbut is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The use \nof Kalydeco in patients with severe hepatic impairment is therefore not recommended unless the \nbenefits outweigh the risks (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). \n \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with ivacaftor in patients with renal impairment. In \na human pharmacokinetic study, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in \nurine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). There was negligible urinary \nexcretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent (less than 0.01% following a single oral dose of 500 mg).  \n \nNo dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. However, caution is \nrecommended when administering ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nRace \nRace had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n = 379) and non-white \n(n = 29) patients based on a population PK analysis. \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of ivacaftor are similar in males and females. \n \nElderly \nClinical studies of ivacaftor monotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years \nand older to determine whether pharmacokinetic parameters are similar or not to those in younger \nadults. \n \nPaediatric population \nPredicted ivacaftor exposure based on observed ivacaftor concentrations in Phase 2 and 3 studies as \ndetermined using population PK analysis is presented by age group in Table 7.  \n \nTable 7: Mean (SD) ivacaftor exposure by age group \n\nAge group Dose Cmin, ss (ng/mL) AUCτ,ss (ng*h/mL) \n6 months to less than 12 months \n(5 kg to < 7 kg) * \n\n25 mg q12h 336 5410 \n\n6 months to less than 12 months \n(7 kg to < 14 kg) \n\n50 mg q12h 508 (252) 9140 (4200) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months \n(7 kg to < 14 kg) \n\n50 mg q12h 440 (212) 9050 (3050) \n\n12 months to less than 24 months \n(≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) \n\n75 mg q12h 451 (125) 9600 (1800) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds \n(< 14 kg) \n\n50 mg q12h 577 (317) 10500 (4260) \n\n2- to 5-year-olds \n(≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) \n\n75 mg q12h 629 (296) 11300 (3820) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † \n(≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg) \n\n75 mg q12h 641 (329) 10760 (4470) \n\n6- to 11-year-olds † \n(≥ 25 kg) \n\n150 mg q12h 958 (546) 15300 (7340) \n\n12- to 17-year-olds 150 mg q12h 564 (242) 9240 (3420) \nAdults (≥ 18 years old) 150 mg q12h 701 (317) 10700 (4100) \n\n* Values based on data from a single patient; standard deviation not reported. \n\n\n\n39 \n\n†\n Exposures in 6- to 11-year-olds are predictions based on simulations from the population PK model using data obtained \n\nfor this age group. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n \nPregnancy and fertility \n \nIvacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall \nfertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant \nreductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average \nlitter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The \nNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of \napproximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as \nivacaftor monotherapy in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \nPlacental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nPeri- and post-natal development \n \nIvacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The \nNOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level approximately 3 times the \nsystemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as ivacaftor monotherapy in \nadult humans at the MRHD.  \n \nJuvenile animal studies \n \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor \nexposure levels of 0.22 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites \nwhen administered as ivacaftor monotherapy. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived \nfrom rat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through \nmilk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week old rats, nor in 3.5 to 5-month old dogs treated with \nivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Kalydeco \n3. How to take Kalydeco \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Kalydeco \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Kalydeco is and what it is used for \n \nKalydeco contains the active ingredient ivacaftor. Ivacaftor acts at the level of the cystic fibrosis \ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein that forms a channel at the cell surface that \nallows the movement of particles such as chloride in and out of the cell. Due to mutations in the CFTR \ngene (see below), chloride movement is reduced in those with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ivacaftor helps \ncertain abnormal CFTR proteins open more often to improve chloride movement in and out of the cell. \n \nKalydeco tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and \nolder and weighing 25 kg or more with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one of the following gating \nmutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or \nS549R. \n \nKalydeco tablets are also indicated for the treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with CF who \nhave an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. \n \nKalydeco tablets can also be used in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of \nadults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with CF who have two F508del mutations in the CFTR \ngene (homozygous for the F508del mutation) or who have an F508del mutation and certain other \nsecond mutations (heterozygous for the F508del mutation). If you have been prescribed Kalydeco to \nbe taken with tezacaftor/ivacaftor, read the tezacaftor/ivacaftor package leaflet. It contains important \ninformation about how to take these two medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Kalydeco \n \nDo not take Kalydeco \n• if you are allergic to ivacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \n• Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems, or have previously had them. Your doctor may \n\nneed to adjust your dose. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n• Increased liver enzymes in the blood have been seen in some people receiving Kalydeco (alone or \nin combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor). Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these \nsymptoms, which may be a sign of liver problems: \n• Pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area \n• Yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes \n• Loss of appetite \n• Nausea or vomiting \n• Dark urine \nYour doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment, particularly \nduring the first year and especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. \n \n\n• Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems, or have previously had them. \n \n\n• Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is not recommended if you have \nundergone an organ transplant. \n\n \n• Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has been noted in some \n\nchildren and adolescents treated with Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor).  \nYour doctor may perform some eye examinations prior to and during treatment. \n\n \n• Kalydeco (alone or in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor) should only be used if you have one \n\nof the mutations in the CFTR gene indicated in section 1 (What Kalydeco is and what it is used \nfor). \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children under 6 months of age with gating mutations as it is not known if \nivacaftor is safe and effective in these children, or in patients under 18 years of age with an R117H \nmutation as ivacaftor may not work in them. \n \nDo not give this medicine in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor to children under 12 years of age as \nit is not known if they are safe and effective for them. \n \nOther medicines and Kalydeco \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \nSome medicines can affect how Kalydeco works, or make side effects more likely. In particular, tell \nyour doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may decide to adjust your \ndose or that you need extra check-ups. \n \n• Antifungal medicines such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and \n\nfluconazole, used for the treatment of fungal infections \n• Antibacterial agents such as telithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, rifampicin and rifabutin, \n\nused for the treatment of bacterial infections \n• Anticonvulsant medicines such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine and phenytoin, used for the \n\ntreatment of epileptic seizures \n• Herbal medicines such as St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n• Immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus and sirolimus used after an organ \n\ntransplantation \n• Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin, used for the treatment of mild to moderate congestive heart \n\nfailure and an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation \n• Anticoagulant medicines such as warfarin, used to prevent blood clots from forming or growing \n\nlarger in blood and blood vessels \n• Medicines for diabetes such as glimepiride and glipizide, used to lower sugar blood levels. \n \nKalydeco with food and drink \nAvoid food or drink containing grapefruit or Seville oranges during treatment with Kalydeco as they \nmay increase the side effects of Kalydeco by increasing the amount of ivacaftor in your body. \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. It may be better to avoid using Kalydeco during \npregnancy, if possible, and your doctor will help you decide what is best for you and your child. \n \nIt is unknown whether ivacaftor is excreted in human milk. If you plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor \nfor advice before taking Kalydeco. Your doctor will decide whether to recommend that you stop \nbreast-feeding or for you to stop ivacaftor therapy. Your doctor will take into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nKalydeco can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle or use machines. \n \nImportant information about the contents of Kalydeco \nKalydeco contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some \nsugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \nKalydeco contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take Kalydeco \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you to. Check with your doctor if you are \nnot sure. \n \nThe recommended dose of Kalydeco is one 150 mg tablet every 12 hours (in total 2 tablets: 300 mg \nper day). \n \nThe recommended dose of Kalydeco in combination with tezacaftor/ivacaftor is one \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor tablet in the morning and one Kalydeco 150 mg tablet in the evening. Take the \ntablets approximately 12 hours apart.  \n \nYou must keep using all other medicines you use, unless your doctor tells you to stop using any. \n \nIf you have liver problems, either moderate or severe, your doctor may need to reduce the dose of your \ntablets, because your liver will not clear the medicine as fast as in people who have normal liver \nfunction. \n \nUse in children \nOther forms of this medicine (granules in sachet) are more suitable for children under 6 years of age; \nask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nKalydeco is for oral use.  \n \nSwallow the tablet whole. Do not break, chew or dissolve the tablets. Take Kalydeco tablets with food \nthat contains fat. \n \nMeals or snacks that contain fat include those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs. \nOther fat-containing foods are: \n• Cheese, whole milk, whole-milk dairy products, yogurt, chocolate \n• Meats, oily fish \n• Avocados, hummus, soy-based products (tofu) \n• Nuts, fat-containing nutritional bars or drinks \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nIf you take more Kalydeco than you should \nYou may experience side effects, including those mentioned in section 4 below.
