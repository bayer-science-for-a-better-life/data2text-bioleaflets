CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMelanoma \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of \nadvanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. \n \nRelative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall \nsurvival (OS) for the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab is established only in patients with \nlow tumour PD-L1 expression (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nAdjuvant treatment of melanoma \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with melanoma with \ninvolvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \n \nOPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated \nfor the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults whose tumours have no \nsensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small \ncell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy in adults. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior \ntherapy in adults. \n \nOPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with \nintermediate/poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma (see section 5.1). \n \nClassical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory \nclassical Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with \nbrentuximab vedotin.  \n \nSquamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell \ncancer of the head and neck in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy (see section 5.1). \n \nUrothelial carcinoma \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic \nurothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. \n \nPosology \n \nOPDIVO as monotherapy \nThe recommended dose of OPDIVO is either nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg \nevery 4 weeks (see section 5.1) depending on the indication, as presented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Recommended dose and infusion time for intravenous administration of \n\nnivolumab monotherapy \n\nIndication* Recommended dose and infusion time \n\nMelanoma (advanced or \nadjuvant treatment) \n\n240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes or \n480 mg every 4 weeks over 60 minutes \n\nRenal cell carcinoma 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes or 480 mg every 4 weeks over 60 minutes \n\nNon-small cell lung cancer 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes \n\nClassical Hodgkin lymphoma 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes \n\nSquamous cell cancer of the \nhead and neck 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes \n\nUrothelial carcinoma 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes \n\n*As per monotherapy indication in section 4.1. \n \nIf melanoma or RCC patients need to be switched from the 240 mg every 2 weeks schedule to the \n480 mg every 4 weeks schedule, the first 480 mg dose should be administered two weeks after the last \n\n\n\n4 \n\n240 mg dose. Conversely, if patients need to be switched from the 480 mg every 4 weeks schedule to \nthe 240 mg every 2 weeks schedule, the first 240 mg dose should be administered four weeks after the \nlast 480 mg dose. \n \nOPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab \n \nMelanoma \nThe recommended dose is 1 mg/kg nivolumab in combination with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab administered \nintravenously every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses. This is then followed by a second phase in which \nnivolumab monotherapy is administered intravenously at either 240 mg every 2 weeks or at 480 mg \nevery 4 weeks, as presented in Table 2. For the monotherapy phase, the first dose of nivolumab should \nbe administered; \n 3 weeks after the last dose of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab if using 240 mg every \n\n2 weeks; or \n 6 weeks after the last dose of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab if using 480 mg every \n\n4 weeks. \n \nTable 2: Recommended doses and infusion times for intravenous administration of \n\nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for melanoma  \n\n \nCombination phase, \n\nevery 3 weeks for \n4 dosing cycles\n\nMonotherapy phase \n\nNivolumab 1 mg/kg over 30 minutes 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes or 480 mg every 4 weeks over 60 minutes \n\nIpilimumab 3 mg/kg over 90 minutes - \n\n \nRenal cell carcinoma \nThe recommended dose is 3 mg/kg nivolumab in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab administered \nintravenously every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses. This is then followed by a second phase in which \nnivolumab monotherapy is administered intravenously at either 240 mg every 2 weeks or at 480 mg \nevery 4 weeks, as presented in Table 3. For the monotherapy phase, the first dose of nivolumab should \nbe administered; \n 3 weeks after the last dose of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab if using 240 mg every \n\n2 weeks; or \n 6 weeks after the last dose of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab if using 480 mg every \n\n4 weeks. \n \nTable 3: Recommended doses and infusion times for intravenous administration of \n\nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for RCC \n\n \nCombination phase, \n\nevery 3 weeks for \n4 dosing cycles \n\nMonotherapy phase \n\nNivolumab 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 minutes or 480 mg every 4 weeks over 60 minutes \n\nIpilimumab 1 mg/kg over 30 minutes - \n\n \nOPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nThe recommended dose is 360 mg nivolumab administered intravenously over 30 minutes every \n3 weeks in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab administered intravenously over 30 minutes every \n6 weeks, and platinum-based chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. After completion of 2 cycles \n\n\n\n5 \n\nof chemotherapy, treatment is continued with 360 mg nivolumab administered intravenously every \n3 weeks in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab every 6 weeks. Treatment is recommended until \ndisease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  \n \nDuration of treatment \nTreatment with OPDIVO, either as a monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab, should be \ncontinued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient \n(and up to maximum duration of therapy if specified for an indication). \n \nFor adjuvant therapy, the maximum treatment duration with OPDIVO is 12 months. \n \nAtypical responses (i.e., an initial transient increase in tumour size or small new lesions within the first \nfew months followed by tumour shrinkage) have been observed. It is recommended to continue \ntreatment with nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for clinically stable patients \nwith initial evidence of disease progression until disease progression is confirmed. \n \nDose escalation or reduction is not recommended. Dosing delay or discontinuation may be required \nbased on individual safety and tolerability. Guidelines for permanent discontinuation or withholding of \ndoses are described in Table 4. Detailed guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse \nreactions are described in section 4.4. \n \nTable 4: Recommended treatment modifications for OPDIVO or OPDIVO in \n\ncombination with ipilimumab\nImmune-related \nadverse reaction  \n\nSeverity Treatment modification \n\nImmune-related \npneumonitis \n\nGrade 2 pneumonitis Withhold dose(s) until symptoms \nresolve, radiographic abnormalities \nimprove, and management with \ncorticosteroids is complete \n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 pneumonitis Permanently discontinue treatment \n\nImmune-related colitis \n\nGrade 2 diarrhoea or colitis Withhold dose(s) until symptoms \nresolve and management with \ncorticosteroids, if needed, is complete \n \n\nGrade 3 diarrhoea or colitis  \n - OPDIVO monotherapy \n\n \nWithhold dose(s) until symptoms \nresolve and management with \ncorticosteroids is complete \n \n\n - OPDIVO+ipilimumaba Permanently discontinue treatment \n\nGrade 4 diarrhoea or colitis Permanently discontinue treatment \n\nImmune-related \nhepatitis \n\nGrade 2 elevation in aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), or total \nbilirubin  \n\nWithhold dose(s) until laboratory \nvalues return to baseline and \nmanagement with corticosteroids, if \nneeded, is complete \n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 elevation in AST, ALT, or \ntotal bilirubin  \n\nPermanently discontinue treatment \n\nImmune-related \nnephritis and renal \ndysfunction \n\nGrade 2 or 3 creatinine elevation  Withhold dose(s) until creatinine \nreturns to baseline and management \nwith corticosteroids is complete \n\nGrade 4 creatinine elevation Permanently discontinue treatment \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 4: Recommended treatment modifications for OPDIVO or OPDIVO in \ncombination with ipilimumab \n\nImmune-related \nadverse reaction  \n\nSeverity Treatment modification \n\nImmune-related \nendocrinopathies \n\nSymptomatic Grade 2 or 3 \nhypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, \nhypophysitis, \nGrade 2 adrenal insufficiency \nGrade 3 diabetes \n\nWithhold dose(s) until symptoms \nresolve and management with \ncorticosteroids (if needed for symptoms \nof acute inflammation) is complete. \nTreatment should be continued in the \npresence of hormone replacement \ntherapyb as long as no symptoms are \npresent \n\nGrade 4 hypothyroidism  \nGrade 4 hyperthyroidism  \nGrade 4 hypophysitis \nGrade 3 or 4 adrenal insufficiency \nGrade 4 diabetes \n\nPermanently discontinue treatment \n\nImmune-related skin \nadverse reactions \n\nGrade 3 rash Withhold dose(s) until symptoms \nresolve and management with \ncorticosteroids is complete \n \n\nGrade 4 rash Permanently discontinue treatment \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or \ntoxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) \n\nPermanently discontinue treatment (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nImmune-related \nmyocarditis \n\nGrade 2 myocarditis Withhold dose(s) until symptoms \nresolve and management with \ncorticosteroids is completec \n \n\nGrade 3 or 4 myocarditis Permanently discontinue treatment \n\nOther immune-related \nadverse reactions \n\nGrade 3 (first occurrence) Withhold dose(s) \n\nGrade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 ; persistent \nGrade 2 or 3 despite treatment \nmodification; inability to reduce \ncorticosteroid dose to 10 mg prednisone \nor equivalent per day \n\nPermanently discontinue treatment \n\nNote: Toxicity grades are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for \nAdverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4). \na  During administration of the second phase of treatment (nivolumab monotherapy) following combination \n\ntreatment, permanently discontinue treatment if Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis occurs. \nb Recommendation for the use of hormone replacement therapy is provided in section 4.4. \nc The safety of re-initiating nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab therapy in patients \n\npreviously experiencing immune-related myocarditis is not known. \n \n \nOPDIVO or OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab should be permanently discontinued for: \n• Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 adverse reactions; \n• Persistent Grade 2 or 3 adverse reactions despite management. \n \nPatients treated with OPDIVO must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks of \nOPDIVO (see also package leaflet). \n \nWhen OPDIVO is administered in combination with ipilimumab, if either agent is withheld, the other \nagent should also be withheld. If dosing is resumed after a delay, either the combination treatment or \nOPDIVO monotherapy could be resumed based on the evaluation of the individual patient. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of OPDIVO in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2). \nData from SCCHN, adjuvant melanoma and first-line RCC patients 75 years of age or older are too \nlimited to draw conclusions on this population (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nRenal impairment \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic (PK) results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with \nmild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with severe renal impairment \nare too limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n \nHepatic impairment \nBased on the population PK results, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (see section 5.2). Data from patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are too \nlimited to draw conclusions on these populations. OPDIVO must be administered with caution in \npatients with moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 × to 3 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST) or \nsevere (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOPDIVO is for intravenous use only. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period \nof 30 or 60 minutes depending on the dose (see Tables 1, 2 and 3). The infusion must be administered \nthrough a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 μm. \n \nOPDIVO must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \n \nThe total dose of OPDIVO required can be infused directly as a 10 mg/mL solution or can be diluted \nwith sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for \ninjection (see section 6.6). \n \nWhen administered in combination with ipilimumab or in combination with ipilimumab and \nchemotherapy, OPDIVO should be given first followed by ipilimumab and then by chemotherapy on \nthe same day. Use separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion. \n \nFor instructions on the preparation and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nImmune-related adverse reactions \nWhen nivolumab is administered in combination, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of \nthe other combination therapy components prior to initiation of treatment. Immune-related adverse \nreactions have occurred at higher frequencies when nivolumab was administered in combination with \nipilimumab compared with nivolumab as monotherapy. Most immune-related adverse reactions \n\n\n\n8 \n\nimproved or resolved with appropriate management, including initiation of corticosteroids and \ntreatment modifications (see section 4.2). \n \nCardiac and pulmonary adverse reactions including pulmonary embolism have also been reported with \ncombination therapy. Patients should be monitored for cardiac and pulmonary adverse reactions \ncontinuously, as well as for clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities indicative of \nelectrolyte disturbances and dehydration prior to and periodically during treatment. Nivolumab in \ncombination with ipilimumab should be discontinued for life-threatening or recurrent severe cardiac \nand pulmonary adverse reactions (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients should be monitored continuously (at least up to 5 months after the last dose) as an adverse \nreaction with nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may occur at any time during \nor after discontinuation of therapy. \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab or \nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. If \nimmunosuppression with corticosteroids is used to treat an adverse reaction, a taper of at least 1 month \nduration should be initiated upon improvement. Rapid tapering may lead to worsening or recurrence of \nthe adverse reaction. Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy should be added if there is \nworsening or no improvement despite corticosteroid use. \n \nNivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should not be resumed while the patient is \nreceiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. \nProphylactic antibiotics should be used to prevent opportunistic infections in patients receiving \nimmunosuppressive therapy. \n \nNivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be permanently discontinued for any \nsevere immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-related \nadverse reaction. \n \nImmune-related pneumonitis \nSevere pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, has been observed with \nnivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (see section 4.8). Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis such as radiographic changes (e.g., focal \nground glass opacities, patchy filtrates), dyspnoea, and hypoxia. Infectious and disease-related \naetiologies should be ruled out. \n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be \npermanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 (symptomatic) pneumonitis, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \nshould be withheld and corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may be \nresumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of \ncorticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents and nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nImmune-related colitis \nSevere diarrhoea or colitis has been observed with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in \ncombination with ipilimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for diarrhoea and \nadditional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and mucus or blood in stool. Cytomegalovirus \n(CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory \nimmune-related colitis. Infectious and other aetiologies of diarrhoea should be ruled out, therefore \nappropriate laboratory tests and additional examinations must be performed. If diagnosis of \n\n\n\n9 \n\ncorticosteroid-refractory immune-related colitis is confirmed addition of an alternative \nimmunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy, or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy, \nshould be considered. \n \nFor Grade 4 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be \npermanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents.  \n \nNivolumab monotherapy should be withheld for Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis, and corticosteroids \ninitiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, \nnivolumab monotherapy may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement \noccurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, nivolumab monotherapy must be permanently \ndiscontinued. Grade 3 diarrhoea or colitis observed with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \nrequires permanent discontinuation of treatment and initiation of corticosteroids at a dose of \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 diarrhoea or colitis, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be \nwithheld. Persistent diarrhoea or colitis should be managed with corticosteroids at a dose \nof 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab or nivolumab \nin combination with ipilimumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or \nno improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased \nto 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents and nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab must be permanently discontinued. \n \nImmune-related hepatitis \nSevere hepatitis has been observed with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis such as \ntransaminase and total bilirubin elevations. Infectious and disease-related aetiologies should be ruled \nout. \n \nFor Grade 3 or 4 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination \nwith ipilimumab must be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose \nof 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 transaminase or total bilirubin elevation, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab should be withheld. Persistent elevations in these laboratory values should be managed \nwith corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. Upon \nimprovement, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may be resumed after \ncorticosteroid taper, if needed. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of \ncorticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents and nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nImmune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction \nSevere nephritis and renal dysfunction have been observed with monotherapy treatment or nivolumab \nin combination with ipilimumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of nephritis or renal dysfunction. Most patients present with asymptomatic increases in \nserum creatinine. Disease-related aetiologies should be ruled out. \n \nFor Grade 4 serum creatinine elevation, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \nmust be permanently discontinued, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose \nof 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents. \n \nFor Grade 2 or 3 serum creatinine elevation, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \nshould be withheld, and corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents. Upon improvement, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper. If worsening or no improvement occurs despite \n\n\n\n10 \n\ninitiation of corticosteroids, corticosteroid dose should be increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents, and nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must \nbe permanently discontinued. \n \nImmune-related endocrinopathies \nSevere endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency (including \nsecondary adrenocortical insufficiency), hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), diabetes mellitus, \nand diabetic ketoacidosis have been observed with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in \ncombination with ipilimumab (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies and for \nhyperglycaemia and changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during \ntreatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation). Patients may present with fatigue, headache, \nmental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific \nsymptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an \nalternate aetiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered \nimmune-related. \n \nFor symptomatic hypothyroidism, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be \nwithheld, and thyroid hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. For symptomatic \nhyperthyroidism, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be withheld and \nantithyroid medication should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day \nmethylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation of the thyroid is \nsuspected. Upon improvement, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may be \nresumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Monitoring of thyroid function should continue to ensure \nappropriate hormone replacement is utilised. Nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. \n \nFor symptomatic Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab should be withheld, and physiologic corticosteroid replacement should be initiated as \nneeded. Nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be permanently discontinued \nfor severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of adrenal \nfunction and hormone levels should continue to ensure appropriate corticosteroid replacement is \nutilised. \n \nFor symptomatic Grade 2 or 3 hypophysitis, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \nshould be withheld, and hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Corticosteroids at a dose \nof 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents should also be considered if acute inflammation \nof the pituitary gland is suspected. Upon improvement, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab may be resumed after corticosteroid taper, if needed. Nivolumab or nivolumab in \ncombination with ipilimumab must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening (Grade 4) \nhypophysitis. Monitoring of pituitary function and hormone levels should continue to ensure \nappropriate hormone replacement is utilised. \n \nFor symptomatic diabetes, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be \nwithheld, and insulin replacement should be initiated as needed. Monitoring of blood sugar should \ncontinue to ensure appropriate insulin replacement is utilised. Nivolumab or nivolumab in \ncombination with ipilimumab must be permanently discontinued for life-threatening diabetes. \n \nImmune-related skin adverse reactions \nSevere rash has been observed with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and, less commonly, \nwith nivolumab as monotherapy (see section 4.8). Nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab should be withheld for Grade 3 rash and discontinued for Grade 4 rash. Severe rash should \nbe managed with high-dose corticosteroid at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone \nequivalents. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nRare cases of SJS and TEN some of them with fatal outcome have been observed. If symptoms or \nsigns of SJS or TEN appear, treatment with nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \nshould be discontinued and the patient referred to a specialised unit for assessment and treatment. If \nthe patient has developed SJS or TEN with the use of nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab, permanent discontinuation of treatment is recommended (see section 4.2). \n \nCaution should be used when considering the use of nivolumab in a patient who has previously \nexperienced a severe or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on prior treatment with other \nimmune-stimulatory anticancer agents. \n \nOther immune-related adverse reactions \nThe following immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients treated with \nnivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in clinical trials across doses \nand tumour types: pancreatitis, uveitis, demyelination, autoimmune neuropathy (including facial and \nabducens nerve paresis), Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome, aseptic \nmeningitis, encephalitis, gastritis, sarcoidosis, duodenitis, myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis. \nCases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and hypoparathyroidism have been reported \npost-marketing (see section 4.8). \n \nFor suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm \naetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab or \nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. \nUpon improvement, nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may be resumed after \ncorticosteroid taper. Nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab must be permanently \ndiscontinued for any severe immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening \nimmune-related adverse reaction. \n \nCases of myotoxicity (myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis), some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported with nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. If a patient develops \nsigns and symptoms of myotoxicity, close monitoring should be implemented, and the patient referred \nto a specialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Based on the severity of myotoxicity, \nnivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be withheld or discontinued (see \nsection 4.2), and appropriate treatment instituted.  \nThe diagnosis of myocarditis requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with cardiac or cardio-\npulmonary symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis. If myocarditis is suspected, prompt \ninitiation of a high dose of steroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone \n1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and prompt cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to current \nclinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a diagnosis of myocarditis is established, nivolumab or \nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be withheld or permanently discontinued (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nSolid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with \nPD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with nivolumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant \nrecipients. The benefit of treatment with nivolumab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should \nbe considered in these patients.  \n \nHaemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed with nivolumab as monotherapy and \nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. Caution should be taken when nivolumab is administered \nas monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab. If HLH is confirmed, administration of \nnivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be discontinued and treatment for \nHLH initiated. \n \nInfusion reactions \nSevere infusion reactions have been reported in clinical trials of nivolumab or nivolumab in \ncombination with ipilimumab (see section 4.8). In case of a severe or life-threatening infusion \nreaction, the nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab infusion must be discontinued \nand appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients with mild or moderate infusion reaction may \n\n\n\n12 \n\nreceive nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab with close monitoring and use of \npremedication according to local treatment guidelines for prophylaxis of infusion reactions. \n \nDisease-specific precautions \n \nAdvanced melanoma \nPatients with a baseline performance score ≥ 2, active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, \nautoimmune disease, and patients who had been receiving systemic immunosuppressants prior to \nstudy entry were excluded from the pivotal clinical trials of nivolumab or nivolumab in combination \nwith ipilimumab (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). Patients with ocular/uveal melanoma were excluded from \npivotal clinical trials of melanoma. In addition, CA209037 excluded patients who have had a Grade 4 \nadverse reaction that was related to anti-CTLA-4 therapy (see section 5.1). Patients with baseline \nperformance score of 2, treated leptomeningeal metastases, ocular/uveal melanoma, autoimmune \ndisease and patients who have had a Grade 3-4 adverse reaction that was related to prior anti-CTLA-4 \ntherapy were included in study CA209172 (see section 5.1). In the absence of data for patients who \nhad been receiving systemic immunosuppressants prior to study entry, and for patients with active \nbrain or leptomeningeal metastases, nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after \ncareful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nRelative to nivolumab monotherapy, an increase in PFS for the combination of nivolumab with \nipilimumab is established only in patients with low tumour PD-L1 expression. The improvement in \nOS was similar between nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy in \npatients with high tumour PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 ≥ 1%). Before initiating treatment with the \ncombination, physicians are advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient and tumour \ncharacteristics, taking into consideration the observed benefits and the toxicity of the combination \nrelative to nivolumab monotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nUse of nivolumab in melanoma patients with rapidly progressing disease \nPhysicians should consider the delayed onset of nivolumab effect before initiating treatment in \npatients with rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1). \n \nAdjuvant treatment of melanoma \nThere are no data on adjuvant treatment in patients with melanoma with the following risk factors (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.1): \n• patients with prior autoimmune disease, and any condition requiring systemic treatment with \n\neither corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive \nmedications, \n\n• patients with prior therapy for melanoma (except patients with surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy after \nneurosurgical resection for lesions of the central nervous system, and prior adjuvant interferon \ncompleted ≥ 6 months prior to randomisation), \n\n• patients treated with prior therapy with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti \nCTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting \nT cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways), \n\n• subjects under the age of 18 years. \nIn the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful \nconsideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nNon-small cell lung cancer \nFirst-line treatment of NSCLC \nPatients with active autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, medical conditions \nrequiring systemic immunosuppression, active (untreated) brain metastasis, who received prior \nsystemic treatment for advanced disease, or who had sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK \ntranslocations were excluded from the pivotal trial in first-line treatment of NSCLC (see sections 4.5 \nand 5.1). Limited data are available in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) (see section 5.1). In these patients, \nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy should be used with caution after \ncareful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTreatment of NSCLC after prior chemotherapy \nPatients with a baseline performance score ≥ 2, active brain metastases or autoimmune disease, \nsymptomatic interstitial lung disease, and patients who had been receiving systemic \nimmunosuppressants prior to study entry were excluded from the pivotal clinical trials of NSCLC (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.1). Patients with baseline performance score of 2 were included in study CA209171 \n(see section 5.1). In the absence of data for patients with autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial \nlung disease, active brain metastases and patients who had been receiving systemic \nimmunosuppressants prior to study entry, nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations \nafter careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \nPhysicians should consider the delayed onset of nivolumab effect before initiating treatment in \npatients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In non-squamous NSCLC, a higher \nnumber of deaths within 3 months was observed in nivolumab compared to docetaxel. Factors \nassociated with early deaths were poorer prognostic factors and/or more aggressive disease combined \nwith low or no tumour PD-L1 expression (see section 5.1). \n \nRenal cell carcinoma \nPatients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical \nconditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the clinical trials of nivolumab \nor nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of data, \nnivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be used with caution in these \npopulations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nClassical Hodgkin lymphoma \nPatients with active autoimmune disease and symptomatic interstitial lung disease were excluded from \nclinical trials of cHL (see section 5.1). In the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with caution \nin these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nComplications of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in classical Hodgkin \nlymphoma \nPreliminary results from the follow-up of patients with cHL undergoing allogeneic HSCT after \nprevious exposure to nivolumab showed a higher than expected number of cases of acute \ngraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and transplant related mortality (TRM). Until further data become \navailable, careful consideration to the potential benefits of HSCT and the possible increased risk of \ntransplant related complications should be made case-by-case (see section 4.8). \n \nIn patients treated with nivolumab after allogeneic HSCT, rapid-onset and severe GVHD, some with \nfatal outcome, have been reported in the post-marketing setting. Treatment with nivolumab may \nincrease the risk of severe GVHD and death in patients who have had prior allogeneic HSCT, mainly \nin those with prior history of GVHD. The benefit of treatment with nivolumab versus the possible risk \nshould be considered in these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nHead and neck cancer \nPatients with a baseline performance score ≥ 2, active brain or leptomeningeal metastases, active \nautoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or carcinoma of the \nnasopharynx or salivary gland as the primary tumour sites were excluded from the SCCHN clinical \ntrial (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of data, nivolumab should be used with caution in these \npopulations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nPhysicians should consider the delayed onset of nivolumab effect before initiating treatment in \npatients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In head and neck cancer, a higher \nnumber of deaths within 3 months was observed in nivolumab compared to docetaxel. Factors \nassociated with early deaths were ECOG performance status, fast progressive disease on prior \nplatinum therapy and high tumour burden. \n \nUrothelial carcinoma \nPatients with a baseline performance score ≥2, active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, \nactive autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were \n\n\n\n14 \n\nexcluded from the clinical trials of urothelial carcinoma (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of \ndata, nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the \npotential benefit/risk on an individual basis. \n \nPatients on controlled sodium diet \nEach mL of this medicinal product contains 0.1 mmol (or 2.5 mg) sodium. This medicinal product \ncontains 10 mg sodium per 4 ml vial, 25 mg sodium per 10 ml vial or 60 mg sodium per 24 ml vial, \nwhich is equivalent to 0.5%, 1.25% or 3% respectively, of the WHO recommended maximum daily \nintake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nPatient alert card \nAll prescribers of OPDIVO must be familiar with the physician information and management \nguidelines. The prescriber must discuss the risks of OPDIVO therapy with the patient. The patient will \nbe provided with the patient alert card with each prescription. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody, as such pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not \nbeen conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes \nor other drug metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered \nmedicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab. \n \nOther forms of interaction \n \nSystemic immunosuppression \nThe use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting \nnivolumab, should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic \nactivity. However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting \nnivolumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions. The preliminary results show that systemic \nimmunosuppression after starting nivolumab treatment does not appear to preclude the response on \nnivolumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of nivolumab in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \nembryofoetal toxicity (see section 5.3). Human IgG4 is known to cross the placental barrier and \nnivolumab is an IgG4; therefore, nivolumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the \ndeveloping foetus. Nivolumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing \npotential not using effective contraception unless the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk. \nEffective contraception should be used for at least 5 months following the last dose of nivolumab. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether nivolumab is secreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products, \nincluding antibodies, can be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from \nnivolumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nStudies to evaluate the effect of nivolumab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of \nnivolumab on male and female fertility is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNivolumab or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may have a minor influence on the ability \nto drive and use machines. Because of potential adverse reactions such as fatigue (see section 4.8), \n\n\n\n15 \n\npatients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery until they are certain \nthat nivolumab does not adversely affect them. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nNivolumab as monotherapy (see section 4.2) \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIn the pooled dataset of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy across tumour types (n = 2578) with \nminimum follow-up ranging from 2.3 to 28 months, the most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were \nfatigue (30%), rash (17%), pruritus (13%), diarrhoea (13%), and nausea (12%). The majority of \nadverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). With a minimum of 63 months follow-up in \nNSCLC, no new safety signals were identified. \n \nAdjuvant treatment of melanoma  \nIn the dataset of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma \n(n = 452), the most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were fatigue (46%), rash (29%), diarrhoea \n(24%), pruritus (23%), nausea (15%), arthralgia (13%), musculoskeletal pain (11%), and \nhypothyroidism (11%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported in the pooled dataset for patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy \n(n = 2578) are presented in Table 5. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by \nfrequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from available post-marketing data).

For additional information on the safety \nprofile of ipilimumab monotherapy, please refer to the ipilimumab SmPC. \n \nMelanoma \nIn the pooled dataset of nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in melanoma \n(n = 448) with minimum follow-up ranging from 6 to 28 months, the most frequent adverse \nreactions (≥ 10%) were rash (52%), fatigue (46%), diarrhoea (43%), pruritus (36%), nausea (26%), \npyrexia (19%), decreased appetite (16%), hypothyroidism (16%), colitis (15%), vomiting (14%), \narthralgia (13%), abdominal pain (13%), headache (11%), and dyspnoea (10%). The majority of \nadverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). \n \nAmong the patients treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in \nCA209067, 154/313 (49%) had the first onset of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions during the initial \ncombination phase.

A steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, without an identified infectious \ncause, was reported in six patients (12%) within the first 6 weeks post-transplantation, with \nthree patients responding to steroids. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease occurred in one patient, who died \nof GVHD and multi-organ failure. Nine of 49 patients (18.4%) died from complications of allogeneic \n\n\n\n28 \n\nHSCT after nivolumab. The 49 patients had a median follow-up from subsequent allogeneic HSCT of \n5.6 months (range: 0-19 months). \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nIn patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a shift \nfrom baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 5.2% for anaemia (all \nGrade 3), 1.0% for thrombocytopaenia, 1.0% for leucopoenia, 10.0% for lymphopaenia, 1.1% for \nneutropaenia, 2.1% for increased alkaline phosphatase, 2.7% for increased AST, 2.2% for increased \nALT, 1.2% for increased total bilirubin, 0.9% for increased creatinine, 3.8% for hyperglycaemia, 1.0% \nfor hypoglycaemia, 3.5% for increased amylase, 7.9% for increased lipase, 6.4% for hyponatraemia, \n1.8% for hyperkalaemia, 1.5% for hypokalaemia, 1.2% for hypercalcaemia, 0.7% for \nhypermagnesaemia, 0.5% for hypomagnesaemia, 0.7% for hypocalcaemia, and 0.1% for \nhypernatraemia. \n \nIn patients treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in melanoma, the \nproportion of patients who experienced a worsening from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory \nabnormality was as follows: 2.8% for anaemia (all Grade 3), 1.2% for thrombocytopaenia, 0.5% for \nleucopoenia, 6.7% for lymphopaenia, 0.7% for neutropaenia, 4.3% for increased alkaline phosphatase, \n12.4% for increased AST, 15.3% for increased ALT, 1.2% for increased total bilirubin, 2.4% for \nincreased creatinine, 5.3% for hyperglycaemia, 8.7% for increased amylase, 19.5% for increased \nlipase, 1.2% for hypocalcaemia, 0.2% each for hypernatraemia and hypercalcaemia, 0.5% for \nhyperkalaemia, 0.3% for hypermagnesaemia, 4.8% for hypokalaemia, and 9.5% for hyponatraemia. \n \nIn patients treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in RCC, the \nproportion of patients who experienced a worsening from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory \nabnormality was as follows: 3.0% for anaemia (all Grade 3), 0.7% for thrombocytopaenia, 0.6% for \nleucopoenia, 5.1% for lymphopaenia, 1.1% for neutropaenia, 2.0% for increased alkaline phosphatase, \n4.8% for increased AST, 6.5% for increased ALT, 1.1% for increased total bilirubin, 2.1% for \nincreased creatinine, 7.2% for hyperglycaemia, 1.8% for hypoglycaemia, 12.2% for increased \namylase, 20.1% for increased lipase, 0.4% for hypocalcaemia, 1.3% for hypercalcaemia, 2.4% for \nhyperkalaemia, 1.1% for hypermagnesaemia, 0.4% for hypomagnesaemia 1.9% for hypokalaemia, and \n9.9% for hyponatraemia. \n \nIn patients treated with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg \nevery 6 weeks and chemotherapy in NSCLC, the proportion of patients who experienced a worsening \nfrom baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 9.2% for anaemia, 4.3% for \nthrombocytopaenia, 9.8% for leucopoenia, 5.8% for lymphopaenia, 14.7% for neutropaenia, 1.2% for \nincreased alkaline phosphatase, 3.5% for increased AST, 4.3% for increased ALT, 0% for increased \ntotal bilirubin, 1.2% for increased creatinine, 7.1% for hyperglycaemia, 0% for hypoglycaemia, \n6.7% for increased amylase, 11.9% for increased lipase, 1.4% for hypocalcaemia, 1.2% for \nhypercalcaemia, 1.7% for hyperkalaemia, 0.3% for hypermagnesaemia, 1.2% for hypomagnesaemia \n3.5% for hypokalaemia, and 10.7% for hyponatraemia. \n \nImmunogenicity \nOf the 2022 patients who were treated with nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and \nevaluable for the presence of anti-product-antibodies, 231 patients (11.4%) tested positive for \ntreatment-emergent anti-product-antibodies with fifteen patients (0.7%) testing positive for \nneutralising antibodies. \n \nOf the patients who were treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and evaluable for \nthe presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-nivolumab antibodies was 26.0% with \nnivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 37.8% with nivolumab 1 mg/kg and \nipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The incidence of neutralising antibodies against nivolumab was \n0.5% with nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 4.6% with nivolumab \n1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Of patients evaluable for the presence of \nanti-ipilimumab antibodies, the incidence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies ranged from 6.3 to 8.4% and \nneutralising antibodies against ipilimumab ranged from 0 to 0.3%. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nOf the patients who were treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy \nand evaluable for the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies or neutralising antibodies against \nnivolumab, the incidence of anti-nivolumab antibodies was 33.8% and the incidence of neutralising \nantibodies was 2.6%. Of the patients who were treated with nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab and chemotherapy and evaluable for the presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies or \nneutralising antibodies against ipilimumab, the incidence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies was 7.5%, and \nthe neutralising antibodies was 1.6%. \n \nAlthough the clearance of nivolumab was increased by 20% when anti-nivolumab-antibodies were \npresent, there was no evidence of loss of efficacy or altered toxicity profile in the presence of \nnivolumab antibodies based on the pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses for both \nmonotherapy and combination. \n \nElderly \nNo overall differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients \n(< 65 years). Data from SCCHN and adjuvant melanoma patients 75 years of age or older are too \nlimited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.1). Data from cHL patients 65 years of \nage or older are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 5.1). \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \nIn the non-squamous NSCLC study (CA209057), the safety profile in patients with baseline renal or \nhepatic impairment was comparable to that in the overall population. These results should be \ninterpreted with caution due to the small sample size within the subgroups. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo cases of overdose have been reported in clinical trials. In case of overdose, patients should be \nclosely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment \ninstituted immediately. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies. ATC code: L01XC17. \n \nMechanism of action \nNivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to \nthe programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 \nreceptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of \nT-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are \nexpressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour \nmicroenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab \npotentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to \nPD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased \ntumour growth. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nCombined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in \nimproved anti-tumour responses in metastatic melanoma. In murine syngeneic tumour models, dual \nblockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in synergistic anti-tumour activity. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nBased on modelling of dose/exposure efficacy and safety relationships, there are no clinically \nsignificant differences in efficacy and safety between a nivolumab dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks or \n3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Additionally, based on these relationships, there were no clinically significant \ndifferences between a nivolumab dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in adjuvant \ntreatment of melanoma, advanced melanoma and advanced RCC. \n \nMelanoma \n \nTreatment of advanced melanoma \n \nRandomised phase 3 study vs. dacarbazine (CA209066) \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study (CA209066). The \nstudy included adult patients (18 years or older) with confirmed, treatment-naive, Stage III or IV \nBRAF wild-type melanoma and an ECOG performance-status score of 0 or 1. Patients with active \nautoimmune disease, ocular melanoma, or active brain or leptomeningeal metastases were excluded \nfrom the study. \n \nA total of 418 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab (n = 210) administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or dacarbazine (n = 208) at 1000 mg/m2 every \n3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 status and M stage (M0/M1a/M1b versus \nM1c). Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no \nlonger tolerated. Treatment after disease progression was permitted for patients who had a clinical \nbenefit and did not have substantial adverse events with the study drug, as determined by the \ninvestigator. Tumour assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours \n(RECIST), version 1.1, were conducted 9 weeks after randomisation and continued every 6 weeks for \nthe first year and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Key \nsecondary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed PFS and objective response rate \n(ORR). \nBaseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The median age was 65 years \n(range: 18-87), 59% were men, and 99.5% were white. Most patients had ECOG performance score of \n0 (64%) or 1 (34%). Sixty-one percent of patients had M1c stage disease at study entry. Seventy-four \npercent of patients had cutaneous melanoma, and 11% had mucosal melanoma; 35% of patients had \nPD-L1 positive melanoma (≥ 5% tumour cell membrane expression). Sixteen percent of patients had \nreceived prior adjuvant therapy; the most common adjuvant treatment was interferon (9%). Four \npercent of patients had a history of brain metastasis, and 37% of patients had a baseline LDH level \ngreater than ULN at study entry. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for OS are shown in Figure 1. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS (CA209066) \n \n\n \nOverall survival (months) \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \nNivolumab \n\n210 185 150 105 45 8 0 \nDacarbazine \n\n208 177 123 82 22 3 0 \n \n──∆─── Nivolumab (events: 50/210), median and 95% CI: N.A. \n- - -- - - Dacarbazine (events: 96/208), median and 95% CI: 10.84 (9.33, 12.09) \n \nThe observed OS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients including \nbaseline ECOG performance status, M stage, history of brain metastases, and baseline LDH level. \nSurvival benefit was observed regardless of whether patients had tumours that were designated PD-L1 \nnegative or PD-L1 positive (tumour membrane expression cut off of 5% or 10%). \n \nData available indicate that the onset of nivolumab effect is delayed such that benefit of nivolumab \nabove chemotherapy may take 2-3 months. \n \nEfficacy results are shown in Table 9. \n\nPr\nob\n\nab\nili\n\nty\n o\n\nf s\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTable 9: Efficacy results (CA209066) \n nivolumab \n\n(n = 210)\ndacarbazine \n\n(n = 208) \nOverall survival  \n Events 50 (23.8%) 96 (46.2%) \n\nHazard ratio  0.42\n99.79% CI (0.25, 0.73) \n\n95% CI (0.30, 0.60)\np-value < 0.0001 \n\n   \n Median (95% CI) Not reached 10.8 (9.33, 12.09) \n Rate (95% CI)   \n  At 6 months 84.1 (78.3, 88.5) 71.8 (64.9, 77.6) \n  At 12 months 72.9 (65.5, 78.9) 42.1 (33.0, 50.9) \nProgression-free survival    \n Events 108 (51.4%) 163 (78.4%) \n\nHazard ratio  0.43 \n95% CI (0.34, 0.56) \np-value < 0.0001\n\n    \n Median (95% CI) 5.1 (3.48, 10.81) 2.2 (2.10, 2.40) \n Rate (95% CI)    \n  At 6 months 48.0 (40.8, 54.9) 18.5 (13.1, 24.6) \n  At 12 months 41.8 (34.0, 49.3) NA \n   \nObjective response  84 (40.0%) 29 (13.9%) \n\n(95% CI) (33.3, 47.0) (9.5, 19.4) \nOdds ratio (95% CI) 4.06 (2.52, 6.54) \n\np-value < 0.0001\n    \n\n Complete response (CR) 16 (7.6%) 2  (1.0%) \n Partial response (PR) 68 (32.4%) 27  (13.0%) \n Stable disease (SD) 35 (16.7%) 46  (22.1%) \n    \nMedian duration of response  \n Months (range) Not reached (0+-12.5+) 6.0 (1.1-10.0+) \n    \nMedian time to response    \n Months (range) 2.1 (1.2-7.6) 2.1 (1.8-3.6) \n\n“+” denotes a censored observation. \n \nRandomised phase 3 study vs. chemotherapy (CA209037) \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, open-label study (CA209037). The \nstudy included adult patients who had progressed on or after ipilimumab and if BRAF V600 mutation \npositive had also progressed on or after BRAF kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients with active \nautoimmune disease, ocular melanoma, active brain or leptomeningeal metastases or a known history \nof prior ipilimumab-related high-grade (Grade 4 per CTCAE v4.0) adverse reactions, except for \nresolved nausea, fatigue, infusion reactions, or endocrinopathies, were excluded from the study. \n \nA total of 405 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab (n = 272) administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or chemotherapy (n = 133) which consisted \nof the investigator’s choice of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) or carboplatin \n(AUC 6 every 3 weeks) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). Randomisation was stratified by \nBRAF and tumour PD-L1 status and best response to prior ipilimumab. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThe co-primary efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR in the first 120 patients treated with \nnivolumab, as measured by independent radiology review committee (IRRC) using RECIST, \nversion 1.1, and comparison of OS of nivolumab to chemotherapy. Additional outcome measures \nincluded duration and timing of response. \n \nThe median age was 60 years (range: 23-88). Sixty-four percent of patients were men and 98% were \nwhite. ECOG performance scores were 0 for 61% of patients and 1 for 39% of patients. The majority \n(75%) of patients had M1c stage disease at study entry. Seventy-three percent of patients had \ncutaneous melanoma and 10% had mucosal melanoma. The number of prior systemic regimen \nreceived was 1 for 27% of patients, 2 for 51% of patients, and > 2 for 21% of patients. Twenty-two \npercent of patients had tumours that tested BRAF mutation positive and 50% of patients had tumours \nthat were considered PD-L1 positive. Sixty-four percent of patients had no prior clinical benefit \n(CR/PR or SD) on ipilimumab. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups except for the \nproportions of patients who had a history of brain metastasis (19% and 13% in the nivolumab group \nand chemotherapy group, respectively) and patients with LDH greater than ULN at baseline \n(51% and 35%, respectively). \n \nAt the time of this final ORR analysis, results from 120 nivolumab-treated patients and \n47 chemotherapy-treated patients who had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up were analysed. \nEfficacy results are presented in Table 10. \n \nTable 10: Best overall response, time and duration of response (CA209037) \n\n nivolumab \n(n = 120)\n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 47) \n\nConfirmed objective response \n(IRRC) \n\n38 (31.7%) 5 (10.6%) \n\n(95% CI) (23.5, 40.8) (3.5, 23.1) \n    \n\n Complete response (CR) 4 (3.3%) 0  \n Partial response (PR) 34 (28.3%) 5 (10.6%) \n Stable disease (SD) 28 (23.3%) 16 (34.0%) \n    \nMedian duration of response    \n Months (range) Not reached 3.6 (Not available) \n    \nMedian time to response    \n Months (range) 2.1 (1.6-7.4) 3.5 (2.1-6.1) \n\n \nData available indicate that the onset of nivolumab effect is delayed such that benefit of nivolumab \nabove chemotherapy may take 2-3 months. \n \nUpdated analysis (24-month follow-up) \nAmong all randomised patients, the ORR was 27.2% (95% CI: 22.0, 32.9) in the nivolumab group and \n9.8% (95% CI: 5.3, 16.1) in the chemotherapy group. Median durations of response were 31.9 months \n(range: 1.4+-31.9) and 12.8 months (range: 1.3+-13.6+), respectively. The PFS HR for nivolumab vs. \nchemotherapy was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.36). The ORR and PFS were assessed by IRRC per RECIST \nversion 1.1. \n \nThere was no statistically significant difference between nivolumab and chemotherapy in the final OS \nanalysis. The primary OS analysis was not adjusted to account for subsequent therapies, with \n54 (40.6%) patients in the chemotherapy arm subsequently receiving an anti-PD1 treatment. OS may \nbe confounded by dropout, imbalance of subsequent therapies and differences in baseline factors. \nMore patients in the nivolumab arm had poor prognostic factors (elevated LDH and brain metastases) \nthan in the chemotherapy arm. \n \nEfficacy by BRAF status: Objective responses to nivolumab (according to the definition of the \nco-primary endpoint) were observed in patients with or without BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. \n\n\n\n34 \n\nThe ORRs in the BRAF mutation-positive subgroup were 17% (95% CI: 8.4, 29.0) for nivolumab and \n11% (95% CI: 2.4, 29.2) for chemotherapy, and in the BRAF wild-type subgroup were \n30% (95% CI: 24.0, 36.7) and 9% (95% CI: 4.6, 16.7), respectively. \n \nThe PFS HRs for nivolumab vs. chemotherapy were 1.58 (95% CI: 0.87, 2.87) for BRAF \nmutation-positive patients and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.12) for BRAF wild-type patients. The OS HRs \nfor nivolumab vs. chemotherapy were 1.32 (95% CI: 0.75, 2.32) for BRAF mutation-positive patients \nand 0.83 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.11) for BRAF wild-type patients. \n \nEfficacy by tumour PD-L1 expression: Objective responses to nivolumab were observed regardless of \ntumour PD-L1 expression. However, the role of this biomarker (tumour PD-L1 expression) has not \nbeen fully elucidated. \n \nIn patients with tumour PD-L1 expression ≥1%, ORR was 33.5% for nivolumab \n(n = 179; 95% CI: 26.7, 40.9) and 13.5% for chemotherapy (n = 74; 95% CI: 6.7, 23.5). In patients \nwith tumour PD-L1 expression <1%, ORR per IRRC was 13.0% (n = 69; 95% CI: 6.1, 23.3) and \n12.0% (n = 25; 95% CI: 2.5, 31.2), respectively. \n \nThe PFS HRs for nivolumab vs. chemotherapy were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.07) in patients with tumour \nPD-L1 expression ≥1% and 1.92 (95% CI: 1.05, 3.5) in patients with tumour PD-L1 expression <1%. \n \nThe OS HRs for nivolumab vs. chemotherapy were 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.96) in patients with tumour \nPD-L1 expression ≥1% and 1.52 (95% CI: 0.89, 2.57) in patients with tumour PD-L1 expression <1%. \n \nThese subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution given the small size of the subgroups and \nlack of statistically significant difference in OS in the all randomised population. \n \nOpen-label phase 1 dose-escalation study (MDX1106-03) \nThe safety and tolerability of nivolumab were investigated in a phase 1, open-label dose-escalation \nstudy in various tumour types, including malignant melanoma. Of the 306 previously treated patients \nenrolled in the study, 107 had melanoma and received nivolumab at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 \nmg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg for a maximum of 2 years. In this patient population, objective response \nwas reported in 33 patients (31%) with a median duration of response of 22.9 months \n(95% CI: 17.0, NR). The median PFS was 3.7 months (95% CI: 1.9, 9.3). The median OS \nwas 17.3 months (95% CI: 12.5, 37.8), and the estimated OS rates were 42% \n(95% CI: 32, 51) at 3 years, 35% (95% CI: 26, 44) at 4 years, and 34% (95% CI: 25, 43) at 5 years \n(minimum follow-up of 45 months). \n \nSingle-arm phase 2 study (CA209172) \nStudy CA209172 was a single-arm, open label study of nivolumab monotherapy in patients with \nstage III (unresectable) or stage IV metastatic melanoma after prior treatment containing an \nanti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. Safety was the primary endpoint and efficacy was a secondary \nendpoint. Of the 1008 treated patients, 103 (10%) had ocular/uveal melanoma, 66 (7%) had an ECOG \nperformance score of 2, 165 (16%) had asymptomatic treated and untreated CNS metastases, \n13 (1.3%) had treated leptomeningeal metastases, 25 (2%) had autoimmune disease, and 84 (8%) had \nGrade 3-4 immune-related AEs with prior anti-CTLA-4 therapy. No new safety signals were identified \nin all treated patients and the overall safety profile of nivolumab was similar across subgroups. \nEfficacy results based on investigator-assessed response rates at week 12 are presented in Table 11 \nbelow. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nTable 11: Response rate at week 12 - all response evaluable patients and by subgroup \n(CA209172) \n\n Total Ocular/ \nUveal \n\nmelanoma \n\nECOG PS 2 \n \n\nCNS \nmetastasis \n\nAutoimmune \ndisease \n\nGrade 3-4 \nirAEs with \n\nanti-CTLA-4 \n\nN \n(%)a \n\n161/588 \n(27.4) \n\n4/61 \n(6.6) \n\n4/20 \n(20.0) \n\n20/73 \n(27.4) \n\n3/16 \n(18.8) \n\n13/46 \n(28.3) \n\na Responses were assessed per RECIST 1.1 for 588/1008 (58.3%) of patients who continued treatment \nthrough week 12 and had a follow-up scan at week 12.  \n\n \nRandomised phase 3 study of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab as \nmonotherapy vs. ipilimumab as monotherapy (CA209067) \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg or nivolumab \n3 mg/kg vs. ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study (CA209067). The \ndifferences between the two nivolumab-containing groups were evaluated descriptively. The study \nincluded adult patients with confirmed unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. Patients were to \nhave ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients who had not received prior systemic \nanticancer therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma were enrolled. Prior adjuvant or \nneoadjuvant therapy was allowed if it was completed at least 6 weeks prior to randomisation. Patients \nwith active autoimmune disease, ocular/uveal melanoma, or active brain or leptomeningeal metastases \nwere excluded from the study. \n \nA total of 945 patients were randomised to receive nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \n(n = 314), nivolumab monotherapy (n = 316), or ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 315). Patients in the \ncombination arm received nivolumab 1 mg/kg over 60 minutes and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg over \n90 minutes administered intravenously every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses, followed by nivolumab \n3 mg/kg as monotherapy every 2 weeks. Patients in the nivolumab monotherapy arm received \nnivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients in the comparator arm received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and \nnivolumab-matched placebo intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by placebo every \n2 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥ 5% vs. < 5% tumour cell membrane \nexpression), BRAF status, and M stage per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging \nsystem. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no \nlonger tolerated. Tumour assessments were conducted 12 weeks after randomisation then every \n6 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary outcome measures were \nprogression-free survival and OS. ORR and the duration of response were also assessed. \n \nBaseline characteristics were balanced across the three treatment groups. The median age was 61 years \n(range: 18 to 90 years), 65% of patients were men, and 97% were white. ECOG performance status \nscore was 0 (73%) or 1 (27%). The majority of the patients had AJCC Stage IV disease (93%); 58% \nhad M1c disease at study entry. Twenty-two percent of patients had received prior adjuvant therapy. \nThirty-two percent of patients had BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; 26.5% of patients had PD-L1 \n≥ 5% tumour cell membrane expression. Four percent of patients had a history of brain metastasis, and \n36% of patients had a baseline LDH level greater than ULN at study entry. Among patients with \nquantifiable tumour PD-L1 expression, the distribution of patients was balanced across the three \ntreatment groups. Tumour PD-L1 expression was determined using the \nPD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. \n \nAt primary analysis (minimum follow-up 9 months) the median PFS was 6.9 months in the nivolumab \ngroup as compared with 2.9 months in the ipilimumab group (HR = 0.57, 99.5% CI: 0.43, 0.76; \np < 0.0001). The median PFS was 11.5 months in the nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \ngroup, as compared with 2.9 months in the ipilimumab group (HR = 0.42, 99.5% CI: 0.31, 0.57; \np < 0.0001). \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPFS results from descriptive analysis (with minimum follow up of 60 months) are shown in Figure 2 \n(all randomised population), Figure 3 (at the tumour PD-L1 5% cut off), and Figure 4 (at the tumour \nPD-L1 1% cut off).   \n\n\n\n37 \n\nFigure 2: Progression-free survival (CA209067) \n\n \nProgression-free survival per investigator (months) \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \nNivolumab + ipilimumab \n\n314 174 136 124 110 101 95 90 82 76 45 2 0 \nNivolumab \n\n316 151 120 106 97 84 78 73 68 65 40 1 0 \nIpilimumab \n\n315 78 46 34 31 28 21 18 17 15 11 1 0 \n \n- -

Median OS for BRAF \n[V600] mutation-positive patients in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm was 24.6 months. In BRAF \nwild-type patients median OS was 39.06 months in the combination arm, 34.37 months in the \nnivolumab monotherapy arm and 18.5 months in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm. The OS HRs for \nnivolumab in combination with ipilimumab vs. nivolumab monotherapy were 0.70 \n(95% CI: 0.46, 1.05) for BRAF[V600] mutation-positive patients and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.15) for \nBRAF wild-type patients. \n \nRandomised phase 2 study of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and ipilimumab (CA209069) \nStudy CA209069 was a randomised, Phase 2, double-blind study comparing the combination of \nnivolumab and ipilimumab with ipilimumab alone in 142 patients with advanced (unresectable or \nmetastatic) melanoma with similar inclusion criteria to study CA209067 and the primary analysis in \npatients with BRAF wild-type melanoma (77% of patients). Investigator assessed ORR was \n61% (95% CI: 48.9, 72.4) in the combination arm (n = 72) versus 11% (95% CI: 3.0, 25.4) for the \nipilimumab arm (n = 37). The estimated 2 and 3 year OS rates were 68% (95% CI: 56, 78) and 61% \n(95% CI: 49, 71), respectively, for the combination (n = 73) and 53% (95% CI: 36, 68) and 44% \n(95% CI: 28, 60), respectively, for ipilimumab (n = 37). \n \nAdjuvant treatment of melanoma \n \nRandomised phase 3 study of nivolumab vs ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (CA209238) \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of patients with \ncompletely resected melanoma were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study \n(CA209238). The study included adult patients, who had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1, \nwith Stage IIIB/C or Stage IV American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 7th edition, histologically \nconfirmed melanoma that is completely surgically resected. Per the AJCC 8th edition, this corresponds \nto patients with lymph node involvement or metastases. Patients were enrolled regardless of their \ntumour PD-L1 status. Patients with prior autoimmune disease, and any condition requiring systemic \ntreatment with either corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other \nimmunosuppressive medications, as well as patients with prior therapy for melanoma (except patients \nwith surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy after neurosurgical resection for lesions of the central nervous \nsystem, and prior adjuvant interferon completed ≥6 months prior to randomisation) prior therapy with, \nanti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti CTLA-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or \nany other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways), were \nexcluded from the study. \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \nA total of 906 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 453) administered \nevery 2 weeks or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (n = 453) administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses then every \n12 weeks beginning at week 24 for up to 1 year. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 \nexpression (≥ 5% vs. < 5%/indeterminate), and stage of disease per the AJCC staging system. Tumour \nassessments were conducted every 12 weeks for the first 2 years then every 6 months thereafter. The \nprimary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RFS, assessed by investigator, was defined as \nthe time between the date of randomisation and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant \nmetastasis), new primary melanoma, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was \n55 years (range: 18-86), 58% were men, and 95% were white. Baseline ECOG performance status \nscore was 0 (90%) or 1 (10%). The majority of patients had AJCC Stage III disease (81%), and 19% \nhad Stage IV disease. Forty-eight percent of patients had macroscopic lymph nodes and 32% had \ntumour ulceration. Forty-two percent of patients were BRAF V600 mutation positive while 45% were \nBRAF wild type and 13% BRAF were status unknown. For tumour PD-L1 expression, 34% of \npatients had PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% and 62% had < 5% as determined by clinical trial assay. Among \npatients with quantifiable tumour PD-L1 expression, the distribution of patients was balanced across \nthe treatment groups. Tumour PD-L1 expression was determined using the \nPD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay.  \n \nMinimum follow-up was approximately 24 months. OS was not mature at the time of this analysis. \nRFS results are shown in Table 13 and Figure 8 (all randomised population). \n \nTable 13: Efficacy results (CA209238) \n\n nivolumab \n(n = 453) \n\nipilimumab 10 mg/kg \n(n = 453) \n\nRecurrence-free survival    \n Events 171 (37.7%) 221 (48.8%) \n\nHazard ratioa  0.66 \n95% CI (0.54, 0.81)\np-value p<0.0001 \n\n   \n Median (95% CI) months Not Availableb \n\n \n24.08  \n\n(16.56, NR) \n \n\n Rate (95% CI) at 12 months 70.4 (65.9, 74.4) 60.0 (55.2, 64.5) \n Rate (95% CI) at 18 months 65.8 (61.2, 70.0) 53.0 (48.1, 57.6) \n Rate (95% CI) at 24 months 62.6 (57.9, 67.0) 50.2 (45.3, 54.8) \n\na Derived from a stratified proportional hazards model. \nb Not available as median unstable due to low number of patients and censoring with 24 months of follow-up \n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nFigure 8: Recurrence-free survival (CA209238) \n\n \n \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \nNivolumab  \n\n453 394 353 331 311 291 280 264 205 28 7 0 \nIpilimumab  \n\n453 363 314 270 251 230 216 204 149 23 5 0 \n \n\n- - - ∆- - - Nivolumab   ──── Ipilimumab \n\n \nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS for patients randomised to the \nnivolumab arm compared with the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg arm.

Tumour \nassessments were performed every 6 weeks after first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, \nthen every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued.  \n \nCA2099LA baseline characteristics were generally balanced across all treatment groups. The median \nage was 65 years (range: 26-86) with 51% ≥ 65 years of age and 10% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority \nof patients were white (89%) and male (70%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or \n1 (68%), 57% of patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% and 37% with PD-L1 < 1%, 31% had squamous and 69% \nhad non-squamous histology, 17% had brain metastases, and 86% were former/current smokers. No \npatients received prior immunotherapy. \n \nCA2099LA primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy endpoints were PFS, ORR, \nand duration of response as assessed by BICR. \n \nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in OS, PFS, and ORR for patients randomised \nto nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy as compared to \nplatinum-based chemotherapy alone at the prespecified interim analysis when 351 events were observed \n(87% of the planned number of events for final analysis). Minimum follow-up for OS was 8.1 months. \n \nEfficacy results are shown in Figure 9 (updated OS analysis with a minimum follow-up of 12.7 months) \nand Table 14 (primary analysis with a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months). \nAn updated efficacy analysis was performed when all patients had a minimum follow-up of 12.7 months \n(see Figure 9). At the time of this analysis, the hazard ratio for OS was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.80) and \nthe hazard ratio for PFS was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.82). \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nFigure 9: Kaplan-Meier plot of OS (CA2099LA) \n\n \nOverall Survival (Months) \n\n \nNumber of Subjects at Risk \nNivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy   \n\n 361 326 292    250        227 153 86 33 10 1 0 \nChemotherapy   \n\n 358 319 260    208        166 116 67 26 11 0 0 \n \n\nNivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy (events: 190/361), median and 95% CI: 15.64 (13.93, 19.98) \nChemotherapy (events: 242/358), median and 95% CI: 10.91 (9.46, 12.55) \n\n \nTable 14: Efficacy results (CA2099LA) \n\n \nnivolumab + ipilimumab + \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 361) \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 358) \n\nOverall survival \n Events 156 (43.2%) 195 (54.5%) \n\nHazard ratio  \n(96.71% CI)a \n\n0.69  \n(0.55, 0.87) \n\nStratified log-rank p-valueb 0.0006 \n Median (months) \n (95% CI) \n\n14.1 \n(13.24, 16.16) \n\n10.7 \n(9.46, 12.45) \n\n Rate (95% CI) at 6 months 80.9 (76.4,84.6) 72.3 (67.4,76.7) \n   \nProgression-free survival \n Events 232 (64.3%) 249 (69.6%) \n\nHazard ratio  \n(97.48% CI)a \n\n0.70  \n(0.57, 0.86) \n\nStratified log-rank p-valuec 0.0001 \n\n Median (months)d\n\n (95% CI) \n6.83 \n\n(5.55, 7.66) \n4.96 \n\n(4.27, 5.55) \n\nPr\nob\n\nab\nilt\n\ny \nof\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl \n\n\n\n49 \n\nTable 14: Efficacy results (CA2099LA) \n\n \nnivolumab + ipilimumab + \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 361) \n\nchemotherapy \n(n = 358) \n\nRate (95% CI) at 6 months 51.7 (46.2, 56.8) 35.9 (30.5, 41.3) \n   \nOverall response ratee 136 (37.7%) 90 (25.1%) \n (95% CI) (32.7, 42.9) (20.7, 30.0) \n\nStratified CMH test p-valuef 0.0003 \n Complete response (CR) 7 (1.9%) 3 (0.8%) \n Partial response (PR) 129 (35.7%) 87 (24.3%) \n   \nDuration of response \n Median (months)  \n (95% CI)d \n\n10.02 \n(8.21, 13.01) \n\n5.09 \n(4.34, 7.00) \n\n % with duration ≥ 6 monthsg 74 41 \na Based on a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. \nb p-value is compared with the allocated alpha of 0.0329 for this interim analysis. \nc p-value is compared with the allocated alpha of 0.0252 for this interim analysis. \nd Kaplan-Meier estimate. \ne Proportion with complete or partial response; CI based on the Clopper and Pearson Method. \nf p-value is compared with the allocated alpha of 0.025 for this interim analysis. \ng Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of duration of response. \nCMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel \n \nSubsequent systemic therapy was received by 28.8% and 41.1% of patients in the combination and \nchemotherapy arms, respectively.

A HR of 1.36 (95% CI: 0.74, 2.52) in OS and a HR of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.96) in PFS was \nobserved for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy within \nthis study subgroup. ORR was 27.0% in the nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and \nchemotherapy arm and 15.2% in the chemotherapy arm. Forty-three percent of patients aged ≥ 75 years \ndiscontinued treatment with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy. Efficacy \nand safety data of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy are limited in this \npatient population. \n \nIn a subgroup analysis, a reduced survival benefit for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and \nchemotherapy compared to chemotherapy was observed in patients who were never smokers. However, \ndue to the small numbers of patients, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. \n \nTreatment of NSCLC after prior chemotherapy \nSquamous NSCLC \n \nRandomised phase 3 study vs. docetaxel (CA209017) \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of advanced or \nmetastatic squamous NSCLC were evaluated in a phase 3, randomised, open-label study (CA209017). \nThe study included patients (18 years or older) who have experienced disease progression during or \nafter one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen and an ECOG performance status score \nof 0 or 1. Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 status. Patients with active \nautoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or active brain metastases were excluded \nfrom the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to \nbaseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing \ndose of < 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. \n \nA total of 272 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 135) administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks or docetaxel (n = 137) 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. \nTreatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer \ntolerated. Tumour assessments, according to the RECIST, version 1.1, were conducted 9 weeks after \nrandomisation and continued every 6 weeks thereafter. The primary efficacy outcome measure was \nOS. Key secondary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed ORR and PFS. In addition, \nsymptom improvement and overall health status were assessed using the Lung cancer symptom score \n(LCSS) average symptom burden index and the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), \nrespectively. \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age \nwas 63 years (range: 39-85) with 44% ≥65 years of age and 11% ≥75 years of age. The majority of \npatients were white (93%) and male (76%). Thirty-one percent had progressive disease reported as the \nbest response to their most recent prior regimen and 45% received nivolumab within 3 months of \ncompleting their most recent prior regimen. Baseline ECOG performance status score was 0 (24%) or \n1 (76%). \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for OS are shown in Figure 10. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nFigure 10: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS (CA209017) \n \n\n \nOverall survival (months) \n\nNumber of subjects at risk   \nNivolumab 3 mg/kg   \n\n135 113 86 69 52 31 15 7 0 \nDocetaxel   \n\n137 103 68 45 30 14 7 2 0 \n \n──∆─── Nivolumab 3 mg/kg (events: 86/135), median and 95% CI: 9.23 (7.33, 13.27) \n- - -- - - Docetaxel (events: 113/137), median and 95% CI: 6.01 (5.13, 7.33) \n \nThe observed OS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups of patients. Survival benefit \nwas observed regardless of whether patients had tumours that were designated PD-L1 negative or \nPD-L1 positive (tumour membrane expression cut off of 1%, 5% or 10%). However, the role of this \nbiomarker (tumour PD-L1 expression) has not been fully elucidated. With a minimum of 62.6 months \nfollow-up, OS benefit remains consistently demonstrated across subgroups. \n \nStudy CA209017 included a limited number of patients ≥ 75 years (11 in the nivolumab group and \n18 in the docetaxel group). Nivolumab showed numerically less effect on OS (HR 1.85; 95% CI: 0.76, \n4.51), PFS (HR = 1.76; 95%-CI: 0.77, 4.05) and ORR (9.1% vs. 16.7%).

Of the 811 treated patients, 103 (13%) had an ECOG performance \nscore of 2, 686 (85%) were < 75 years old and 125 (15%) were ≥ 75 years old.

The study included patients (18 years or older) who have experienced disease \nprogression during or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen which may have \nincluded maintenance therapy and who had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. An \nadditional line of TKI therapy was allowed for patients with known EGFR mutation or ALK \ntranslocation. Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour PD-L1 status. Patients with active \nautoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or active brain metastases were excluded \nfrom the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to \nbaseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing \ndose of < 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. \n \nA total of 582 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n = 292) or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks \n(n = 290). Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no \nlonger tolerated. Tumour assessments were conducted according to the RECIST version 1.1. The \nprimary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Key secondary efficacy outcome measures were \ninvestigator-assessed ORR and PFS. Additional prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to \nevaluate the efficacy of tumour PD-L1 expression at predefined levels of 1%, 5% and 10%. \nAssessment according to discrete PD-L1 expression intervals were not included in the prespecified \nanalyses due to the small sample sizes within the intervals. \n \nPre-study tumour tissue specimens were systematically collected prior to randomisation in order to \nconduct pre-planned analyses of efficacy according to tumour PD-L1 expression. Tumour PD-L1 \nexpression was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. \n \nThe median age was 62 years (range: 21 to 85) with 34% ≥65 years of age and 7% ≥75 years of age. \nThe majority of patients were white (92%) and male (55%).

Patients had to have a Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%. This study included \npatients regardless of their tumour PD-L1 status. Patients with any history of or concurrent brain \nmetastases, prior treatment with an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, active \nautoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded \nfrom the study. \n \nA total of 821 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 410) administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks or everolimus (n = 411) 10 mg daily, administered \norally. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no \nlonger tolerated. The first tumour assessments were conducted 8 weeks after randomisation and \ncontinued every 8 weeks thereafter for the first year and then every 12 weeks until progression or \ntreatment discontinuation, whichever occurred later. Tumour assessments were continued after \ntreatment discontinuation in patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than progression. \nTreatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST, version 1.1-defined progression was \npermitted if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug as determined by the \ninvestigator. The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Secondary efficacy assessments \nincluded investigator-assessed ORR and PFS. \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was \n62 years (range: 18-88) with 40% ≥ 65 years of age and 9% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients \nwere male (75%) and white (88%), all Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups \nwere represented, and 34% and 66% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80% and 90 to 100%, \nrespectively. The majority of patients (72%) were treated with one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The \nmedian duration of time from initial diagnosis to randomisation was 2.6 years in both the nivolumab \nand everolimus groups. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0-29.6+ months) in \nnivolumab-treated patients and was 3.7 months (range: 6 days-25.7+ months) in everolimus-treated \npatients. \nNivolumab was continued beyond progression in 44% of patients. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for OS are shown in Figure 12. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nFigure 12: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS (CA209025) \n \n\n \nOverall survival (months) \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \nNivolumab \n\n410 389 359 337 305 275 213 139 73 29 3 0 \nEverolimus \n\n411 366 324 287 265 241 187 115 61 20 2 0 \nNivolumab 3 mg/kg (events: 183/410), median and 95% CI: 25.00 (21.75, N.A.) \n Everolimus 10 mg (events: 215/411), median and 95% CI: 19.55 (17.64, 23.06) \n\n \nThe trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomised to \nnivolumab as compared with everolimus at the prespecified interim analysis when 398 events were \nobserved (70% of the planned number of events for final analysis) (Table 20 and Figure 12).

Apparently meaningful symptom improvement (MID = 2 point change in FKSI-DRS score; \np < 0.001) and time to improvement (HR = 1.66 (1.33, 2.08), p < 0.001) were significantly better for \npatients on the nivolumab arm. While both arms of the study received active therapy, the QoL data \nshould be interpreted in the context of the open-label study design and therefore cautiously taken. \n \nPhase 3b/4 safety study (CA209374) \nAdditional safety and descriptive efficacy data are available from study CA209374, an open-label \nPhase 3b/4 safety study of nivolumab monotherapy (treated with 240 mg every 2 weeks) for the \ntreatment of patients with advanced or metastatic RCC (n = 142), including 44 patients with non-clear \ncell histology.  \n \n\n\n\n60 \n\nIn subjects with non-clear cell histology, at a minimum follow-up of approximately 16.7 months ORR \nand median duration of response were 13.6% and 10.2 months, respectively.

The study included patients (18 years or older) with previously untreated, advanced or \nmetastatic renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component. The primary efficacy population included \nthose intermediate/poor risk patients with at least 1 or more of 6 prognostic risk factors as per the \nInternational Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria (less than one year from time of \ninitial renal cell carcinoma diagnosis to randomisation, Karnofsky performance status <80%, \nhaemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium of greater than 10 mg/dL, platelet \ncount greater than the upper limit of normal, and absolute neutrophil count greater than the upper limit \nof normal). This study included patients regardless of their tumour PD-L1 status. Patients with \nKarnofsky performance status < 70% and patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, \nactive autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were \nexcluded from the study. Patients were stratified by IMDC prognostic score and region. \n \nA total of 1096 patients were randomised in the trial, of which 847 patients had intermediate/poor-risk \nRCC and received either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 425) administered intravenously over 60 minutes in \ncombination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for \n4 doses followed by nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or sunitinib (n = 422) 50 mg \ndaily, administered orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle. Treatment was continued \nas long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer tolerated. The first tumour \nassessments were conducted 12 weeks after randomisation and continued every 6 weeks thereafter for \nthe first year and then every 12 weeks until progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever \noccurred later. Treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST, version 1.1-defined \nprogression was permitted if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug as \ndetermined by the investigator. The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS, ORR and PFS as \ndetermined by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in intermediate/poor risk patients.  \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was \n61 years (range: 21-85) with 38% ≥ 65 years of age and 8% ≥ 75 years of age. The majority of patients \nwere male (73%) and white (87%), and 31% and 69% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80% and \n90 to 100%, respectively. The median duration of time from initial diagnosis to randomisation was \n0.4 years in both the nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and sunitinib \ngroups. The median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (range: 1 day-21.4+ months) in nivolumab \nwith ipilimumab-treated patients and was 7.8 months (range: 1 days-20.2+ months) in sunitinib-treated \npatients. Nivolumab with ipilimumab was continued beyond progression in 29% of patients. \n \nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for OS (with a minimum follow-up of 24 months) in intermediate/poor risk \npatients are shown in Figure 13. \n\n\n\n61 \n\nFigure 13: Kaplan-Meier curves of OS in intermediate/poor risk patients (CA209214) \n \n\n \nOverall survival (months) \n\nNumber of subjects at risk \nNivolumab + ipilimumab \n425 399 372 348 332 317 306 282 257 201 102 33 4 0 \nSunitinib   \n422 387 352 316 288 253 233 216 196 147 87 36 3 0 \nNivolumab + ipilimumab (events: 166/425), median and 95.0% CI: NA (32.49, NA) \n Sunitinib (events: 209/422), median and 95.0% CI: 26.97 (22.08, 34.83) \n\n \nIn intermediate/poor-risk patients, OS benefit was observed in the nivolumab in combination with \nipilimumab arm vs. sunitinib regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression.

OS in favourable risk patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab \ncompared to sunitinib had a hazard ratio of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.99; p = 0.6710). \n \nThere are no data on the use of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in patients with only a non \nclear-cell histology in first line RCC. \n \nEfficacy results for the intermediate/poor risk patients from the primary analysis (minimum follow-up \n17.5 months) are shown in Table 21. \n \n\nPr\nob\n\nab\nili\n\nty\n o\n\nf s\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl \n\n\n\n62 \n\nTable 21: Efficacy results in intermediate/poor risk patients (CA209214) \n nivolumab + ipilimumab \n\n(n = 425)\nsunitinib \n(n = 422) \n\nOverall survival   \n Events 140 (33%) 188 (45%) \n\nHazard ratioa  0.63\n99.8% CI (0.44, 0.89) \np-valueb, c < 0.0001\n\n \n Median (95% CI) NE (28.2, NE) 25.9 (22.1, NE) \n Rate (95% CI)   \n  At 6 months 89.5 (86.1, 92.1) 86.2 (82.4, 89.1)\n  At 12 months 80.1 (75.9, 83.6) 72.1 (67.4, 76.2) \nProgression-free survival   \n Events 228 (53.6%) 228 (54.0%) \n\nHazard ratioa 0.82 \n99.1% CI (0.64, 1.05) \np-valueb,h 0.0331\n\n Median (95% CI) \n \n\n11.6 (8.71, 15.51) 8.4 (7.03, 10.81) \n\nConfirmed objective response \n(BICR)  \n\n177 (41.6%) 112 (26.5%) \n\n(95% CI) (36.9, 46.5) (22.4, 31.0) \nDifference in ORR (95% CI)d 16.0 (9.8, 22.2)\n\np-valuee,f < 0.0001 \n\n Complete response (CR) 40 (9.4%) 5 (1.2%) \n Partial response (PR) 137 (32.2%) 107 (25.4%) \n Stable disease (SD) 133 (31.3%) 188 (44.5%) \n \nMedian duration of responseg    \n  Months (range) NE (1.4+-25.5+) 18.17 (1.3+-23.6+) \n \nMedian time to response   \n Months (range) 2.8 (0.9-11.3) 3.0 (0.6-15.0) \n\na Based on a stratified proportional hazards model. \nb Based on a stratified log-rank test. \nc p-value is compared to alpha 0.002 in order to achieve statistical significance. \nd Strata adjusted difference. \ne Based on the stratified DerSimonian-Laird test. \nf p-value is compared to alpha 0.001 in order to achieve statistical significance. \ng Computed using Kaplan-Meier method. \nh p-value is compared to alpha 0.009 in order to achieve statistical significance. \n“+” denotes a censored observation. \nNE = non-estimable  \n \nAn updated OS analysis was performed when all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months (see \nfigure 13). At the time of this analysis, the hazard ratio was 0.66; (99.8% CI 0.48-0.91) with 166/425 \nevents in the combination arm and 209/422 events in the sunitinib arm. At 18 months, the OS rate was \n74.3 (95% CI 69.8-78.2) for nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and 59.9 (95% CI 54.9-64.5) \nfor sunitinib.

Because of the small size of this subgroup, \nno definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \nClassical Hodgkin lymphoma \n \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of relapsed or \nrefractory cHL following ASCT was evaluated in two multi-centre, open-label, single-arm studies \n(CA209205 and CA209039). \n \nCA209205 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, multi-cohort, single-arm study of nivolumab in cHL. It \nincludes 243 patients who had ASCT; Cohort A included 63 (26%) patients who were brentuximab \nvedotin naïve; Cohort B included 80 (33%) patients who had received brentuximab vedotin after \nASCT failure; and Cohort C included 100 (41%) patients who had received brentuximab vedotin \nbefore and/or after ASCT out of which 33 (14%) patients received brentuximab vedotin only prior to \nASCT. All patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy intravenously over 60 minutes every \n2 weeks. The first tumour assessments were conducted 9 weeks after the start of treatment and \ncontinued thereafter until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. The primary efficacy \noutcome measure was ORR as determined by an IRRC. Additional efficacy measures included \nduration of response, PFS and OS. \n \nCA209039 is a Phase 1b open-label, multi-centre, dose-escalation, and multidose study of nivolumab \nin relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, including 23 patients with cHL treated with \nnivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy; amongst which, 15 patients received prior brentuximab vedotin \ntreatment as a salvage therapy following ASCT, similar to Cohort B of study CA209205. The first \ntumour assessments were conducted 4 weeks after the start of treatment and continued thereafter until \ndisease progression or treatment discontinuation. Efficacy assessments included investigator-assessed \nORR, retrospectively evaluated by an IRRC, and duration of response.  \n \nData from the 80 patients from CA209205 Cohort B and from the 15 patients from CA209039 who \nreceived prior brentuximab vedotin treatment following ASCT were integrated. Additional data from \n100 patients from CA209205 Cohort C who received brentuximab before and/or after ASCT are also \npresented.

Prior platinum-based therapy was administered in either the \nadjuvant, neo-adjuvant, primary, recurrent, or metastatic setting. Patients were enrolled regardless of \ntheir tumour PD-L1 or human papilloma virus (HPV) status. Patients with active autoimmune disease, \nmedical conditions requiring immunosuppression, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the \nnasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary, salivary gland or non-squamous \nhistologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma), or active brain or leptomeningeal metastases were excluded \nfrom the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to \nbaseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing \ndose of < 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. \n \nA total of 361 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg (n = 240) administered \nintravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks or investigator’s choice of either cetuximab (n = 15), \n400 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly or methotrexate (n = 52) 40 to 60 mg/m2 \nweekly, or docetaxel (n = 54) 30 to 40 mg/m2 weekly. Randomisation was stratified by prior \ncetuximab treatment. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until \ntreatment was no longer tolerated. Tumour assessments, according to RECIST version 1.1, were \nconducted 9 weeks after randomisation and continued every 6 weeks thereafter. Treatment beyond \ninitial investigator-assessed RECIST version 1.1-defined progression was permitted in patients \nreceiving nivolumab, if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug, as determined \nby the investigator. The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Key secondary efficacy outcome \nmeasures were investigator-assessed PFS and ORR. Additional prespecified subgroup analyses were \nconducted to evaluate the efficacy by tumour PD-L1 expression at predefined levels of 1%, 5%, and \n10%. \n \nPre-study tumour tissue specimens were systematically collected prior to randomisation in order to \nconduct pre-planned analyses of efficacy according to tumour PD-L1 expression. Tumour PD-L1 \nexpression was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. \n \nBaseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age \nwas 60 years (range: 28-83) with 31% ≥ 65 years of age and 5% ≥ 75 years of age, 83% were male, \nand 83% were white. Baseline ECOG performance status score was 0 (20%) or 1 (78%), 77% were \nformer/current smokers, 90% had Stage IV disease, 66% had two or more lesions, 45%, 34% and 20% \nreceived 1, 2, or 3 or more prior lines of systemic therapy, respectively, and 25% were HPV-16 status \npositive. \n \nWith a minimum follow-up of 11.4 months, the trial demonstrated a statistically significant \nimprovement in OS for patients randomised to nivolumab as compared with investigator’s choice.

Due to the \nsmall numbers of patients in the subgroups, and exploratory nature of the analysis, no definitive \nconclusions can be drawn from these data. \n \nTable 27: Efficacy by tumour cell and TAIC PD-L1 expression (CA209141) \n\n Median OSa (months) Median PFSa (months) ORR (%) \n\n HRb (95% CI) HRb (95% CI) (95% CI)c \n\n nivolumab investigator’s \nchoice \n\nnivolumab investigator’s \nchoice \n\nnivolumab investigator’s \nchoice \n\nPD-L1 ≥ 1%, \nPD-L1+ TAIC \nabundantd \n(61 nivolumab, \n47 investigator’s choice) \n\n9.10 4.60 3.19 1.97 19.7 0 \n\n0.43 (0.28, 0.67) 0.48 (0.31, 0.75) (10.6, 31.8) (0, 7.5) \n\nPD-L1 ≥ 1%, \nPD-L1+ TAIC rared \n(27 nivolumab, \n14 investigator’s choice) \n\n6.67 4.93 1.99 2.04 11.1 7.1 \n\n0.89 (0.44, 1.80) 0.93 (0.46, 1.88) (2.4, 29.2) (0.2, 33.9) \n\nPD-L1 < 1%, \nPD-L1+ TAIC \nabundantd \n(43 nivolumab, \n25 investigator’s choice) \n\n11.73 6.51 2.10 2.73 18.6  12.0 \n\n0.67 (0.38, 1.18) 0.96 (0.55, 1.67) (8.4, 33.4) (2.5, 31.2) \n\nPD-L1 < 1%, \nPD-L1+ TAIC rared \n(27 nivolumab, \n10 investigator’s choice) \n\n3.71 4.85 1.84 2.12 3.7 10.0 \n\n1.09 (0.50, 2.36) 1.91 (0.84, 4.36) (< 0.1, 19.0) (0.3, 44.5) \n\na OS and PFS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. \nb Hazard ratio in each subgroup derived from a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the only \n\ncovariate. \nc Confidence interval for ORR calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. \nd PD-L1+ TAIC in the tumour microenvironment were qualitatively assessed, and characterised as \n\n“numerous”, “intermediate”, and “rare” based on pathologist assessments. “Numerous” and \n“intermediate” groups were combined to define the “abundant” group. \n\n \nPatients with investigator-assessed primary site of oropharyngeal cancer were tested for HPV \n(determined by p16 immunohistochemistry [IHC]). OS benefit was observed regardless of HPV status \n(HPV-positive: HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.04, HPV-negative: HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.03, and \nHPV-unknown: HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.10). \n \n\n\n\n70 \n\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-H&N35, \nand 3-level EQ-5D. Over 15 weeks of follow-up, patients treated with nivolumab exhibited stable \nPROs, while those assigned to investigator’s choice therapy exhibited significant declines in \nfunctioning (e.g., physical, role, social) and health status as well as increased symptomatology (e.g., \nfatigue, dyspnoea, appetite loss, pain, sensory problems, social contact problems). The PRO data \nshould be interpreted in the context of the open-label study design and therefore taken cautiously. \n \nUrothelial carcinoma \n \nOpen-label phase 2 study (CA209275) \nThe safety and efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a single agent for the treatment of patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma was evaluated in a phase 2, multicentre, \nopen-label, single-arm study (CA209275). \nThe study included patients (18 years or older) who had disease progression during or following \nplatinum-containing chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease or had disease progression \nwithin 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. \nPatients had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1 and were enrolled regardless of their tumour \nPD-L1 status. Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, active autoimmune \ndisease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study. \nPatients that received more than 2 prior lines of chemotherapy with liver metastases were excluded. \n \nA total of 270 patients who received nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes \nevery 2 weeks with a minimum follow-up of 8.3 months were evaluable for efficacy. Treatment was \ncontinued as long as clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer tolerated. The first \ntumour assessments were conducted 8 weeks after the start of treatment and continued every 8 weeks \nthereafter up to 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, \nwhichever occurred later. Tumour assessments were continued after treatment discontinuation in \npatients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than progression. Treatment beyond initial \ninvestigator-assessed RECIST, version 1.1-defined progression was permitted if the patient had a \nclinical benefit, did not have rapid disease progression, and was tolerating study drug as determined by \nthe investigator. The primary efficacy outcome measure was ORR as determined by BICR. Additional \nefficacy measures included duration of response, PFS and OS. \n \nThe median age was 66 years (range: 38 to 90) with 55% ≥65 years of age and 14% ≥75 years of age. \nThe majority of patients were white (86%) and male (78%). Baseline ECOG performance status was \n0 (54%) or 1 (46%). \n \n\n\n\n71 \n\nTable 28:  Efficacy results (CA209275)a \n nivolumab \n\n(n = 270) \n\nConfirmed objective response 54 (20.0%) \n  (95% CI) (15.4, 25.3) \n Complete response (CR) 8 (3.0%) \n Partial response (PR) 46 (17.0%) \n Stable disease (SD) 60 (22.2%) \n\nMedian duration of responseb  \n Months (range) 10.4 (1.9+-12.0+) \n\nMedian time to response  \n Months (range) 1.9 (1.6, 7.2) \n\nProgression-free survival  \n Events (%) 216 (80%) \n Median (95% CI) months 2.0 (1.9, 2.6) \n Rate (95% CI) at 6 months 26.1 (20.9, 31.5) \n\nOverall survivalc  \n Events (%) 154 (57%) \n Median (95% CI) months 8.6 (6.05, 11.27) \n Rate (95% CI) at 12 months 41.0 (34.8, 47.1) \n\nTumour PD-L1 expression level \n < 1% ≥ 1% \n\nConfirmed objective response \n(95% CI) \n\n 16% (10.3, 22.7) \nn = 146 \n\n25% (17.7, 33.6) \nn = 124 \n\nMedian duration of response \nMonths (range) \n\n 10.4 (3.7, 12.0+) Not Reached (1.9+, 12.0+) \n\nProgression-free survival \n\n Median (95% CI) months 1.9 (1.8, 2.0) 3.6 (1.9, 3.7) \n\n Rate (95% CI) at 6 months 22.0 (15.6, 29.2) 30.8 (22.7, 39.3) \n\nOverall survival   \n\n Median (95% CI) months 5.9 (4.37, 8.08) 11.6 (9.10, NE) \n\n Rate (95% CI) at 12 months 34.0 (26.1, 42.1) 49.2 (39.6, 58.1) \n\n“+” denotes a censored observation. \na median follow-up 11.5 months. \nb Data unstable due to the limited duration of response. \nc included 4 drug-related deaths: 1 pneumonitis, 1 acute respiratory failure, 1 respiratory failure, and \n\n1 cardiovascular failure. \nNE: non-estimable \n \nResults from post-hoc, exploratory analyses indicate that in patients with low (e.g. <1%) to no tumour \nPD-L1 expression, other patient characteristics (e.g. liver metastases, visceral metastases, baseline \nhaemoglobin <10g/dL and ECOG performance status = 1) might contribute to the clinical outcome. \n \nOpen-label phase 1/2 study (CA209032) \nCA209032 was a Phase 1/2 open-label multi-cohort study which included a cohort of 78 patients \n(including 18 subjects who received planned crossover treatment with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus \n\n\n\n72 \n\nipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination) with similar inclusion criteria to study CA209275 treated with \nnivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg for urothelial carcinoma. At a minimum follow-up of 9 months, \ninvestigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 24.4% (95% CI: 15.3, 35.4). The median duration of \nresponse was not reached (range: 4.4-16.6+ months). The median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI:7.26, \n16.16) and the estimated OS rates were 69.2% (CI: 57.7, 78.2) at 6 months and 45.6% (CI: 34.2, 56.3) \nat 12 months. \n \nSafety and efficacy in elderly patients \nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger \npatients (< 65 years). Data from SCCHN and adjuvant melanoma patients 75 years of age or older are \ntoo limited to draw conclusions on this population. Data from cHL patients 65 years of age or older \nare too limited to draw conclusions on this population. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nnivolumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours, \nmalignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue and malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNivolumab monotherapy \nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab is linear in the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. The geometric \nmean clearance (CL), terminal half-life, and average exposure at steady state at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks \nof nivolumab were 7.9 mL/h, 25.0 days, and 86.6 μg/mL, respectively, based on a population PK \nanalysis. \n \nNivolumab CL in cHL patients was approximately 32% lower relative to NSCLC. Nivolumab baseline \nCL in adjuvant melanoma patients was approximately 40% lower and steady state CL approximately \n20 % lower relative to advanced melanoma. With available safety data, these decreases in CL were not \nclinically meaningful. \n \nThe metabolic pathway of nivolumab has not been characterised. Nivolumab is expected to be \ndegraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as \nendogenous IgG. \n \nNivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  \nWhen nivolumab 1 mg/kg was administered in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, the CL of \nnivolumab was increased by 29% and the CL of ipilimumab was increased by 9%, which was not \nconsidered clinically relevant. When nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered in combination with \nipilimumab 1 mg/kg, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 1% and the CL of ipilimumab was \ndecreased by 1.5%, which were not considered clinically relevant.  \n \nWhen administered in combination with ipilimumab, the CL of nivolumab increased by 20% in the \npresence of anti-nivolumab antibodies and the CL of ipilimumab increased by 5.7% in the presence of \nanti-ipilimumab antibodies. These changes were not considered clinically relevant. \n \nNivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy \nWhen nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg \nevery 6 weeks and with 2 cycles of chemotherapy, the CL of nivolumab decreased approximately 10% \nand the CL of ipilimumab increased approximately 22%, which were not considered clinically \nrelevant.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nA population PK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, \nsolid tumour type, tumour size, and hepatic impairment. Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular \n\n\n\n73 \n\nfiltration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab \nCL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of renal impairment on the CL of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with mild \n(GFR < 90 and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 379), moderate (GFR < 60 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; \nn = 179), or severe (GFR < 30 and ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 2) renal impairment compared to \npatients with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n = 342) in population PK analyses. \nNo clinically important differences in the CL of nivolumab were found between patients with mild or \nmoderate renal impairment and patients with normal renal function. Data from patients with severe \nrenal impairment are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of nivolumab was evaluated in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin 1.0 × to 1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN as defined using the National Cancer \nInstitute criteria of hepatic dysfunction; n = 92) compared to patients with normal hepatic function \n(total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN; n = 804) in the population PK analyses. No clinically important \ndifferences in the CL of nivolumab were found between patients with mild hepatic impairment and \nnormal hepatic function. Nivolumab has not been studied in patients with moderate (total \nbilirubin > 1.5 × to 3 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN \nand any AST) (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nBlockade of PD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance \nto the foetus and to increase foetal loss. The effects of nivolumab on prenatal and postnatal \ndevelopment were evaluated in monkeys that received nivolumab twice weekly from the onset of \norganogenesis in the first trimester through delivery, at exposure levels either 8 or 35 times higher \nthan those observed at the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of nivolumab (based on AUC). There was a \ndose-dependent increase in foetal losses and increased neonatal mortality beginning in the third \ntrimester. \n \nThe remaining offspring of nivolumab-treated females survived to scheduled termination, with no \ntreatment-related clinical signs, alterations to normal development, organ-weight effects, or gross and \nmicroscopic pathology changes. Results for growth indices, as well as teratogenic, neurobehavioral, \nimmunological, and clinical pathology parameters throughout the 6-month postnatal period were \ncomparable to the control group. However, based on its mechanism of action, foetal exposure to \nnivolumab may increase the risk of developing immune-related disorders or altering the normal \nimmune response and immune-related disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice. \n \nFertility studies have not been performed with nivolumab. \n \n \n6.

Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the total \ndose to be given.  \n\n \n The total nivolumab dose in mg = the patient’s weight in kg × the prescribed dose in mg/kg.  \n The volume of OPDIVO concentrate to prepare the dose (mL) = the total dose in mg, divided \n\nby 10 (the OPDIVO concentrate strength is 10 mg/mL).  \n \nNivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy \nThe prescribed dose for the patient is 360 mg given regardless of body weight. \n \nPreparing the infusion \nTake care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion. \n \nOPDIVO can be used for intravenous administration either: \n without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; or \n after diluting according to the following instructions: \n the final infusion concentration should range between 1 and 10 mg/mL. \n the total volume of infusion must not exceed 160 mL. For patients weighing less than 40 kg, \n\nthe total volume of infusion must not exceed 4 mL per kilogram of patient weight.  \n \nOPDIVO concentrate may be diluted with either: \n\n sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection; or \n 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. \n\n \nSTEP 1 \n Inspect the OPDIVO concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not shake the vial. \n\nOPDIVO concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid. Discard the vial if \nthe solution is cloudy, is discoloured, or contains particulate matter other than a few \ntranslucent-to-white particles. \n\n Withdraw the required volume of OPDIVO concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe. \n \nSTEP 2 \n Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or intravenous container (PVC or \n\npolyolefin). \n If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. For ease of preparation, the concentrate \ncan also be transferred directly into a pre-filled bag containing the appropriate volume of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. \n\n Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nAdministration \nOPDIVO infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \nAdminister the OPDIVO infusion intravenously over a period of 30 or 60 minutes depending on the \ndose. \nOPDIVO infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion. \n \nUse an infusion set and an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size \nof 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm). \n \nOPDIVO infusion is compatible with PVC and polyolefin containers, glass bottles, PVC infusion sets \nand in-line filters with polyethersulfone membranes with pore sizes of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm. \n \nAfter administration of the nivolumab dose, flush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. \n \nDisposal \nDo not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicinal product or \nwaste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n90 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nOPDIVO 10 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \nnivolumab \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- It is important that you keep the alert card with you during treatment. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in \n\nthis leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What OPDIVO is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use OPDIVO \n3. How to use OPDIVO \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store OPDIVO \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What OPDIVO is and what it is used for \n \nOPDIVO is a medicine used to treat: \n advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer) in adults \n melanoma after complete resection in adults (treatment after surgery is called adjuvant therapy) \n advanced non-small cell lung cancer (a type of lung cancer) in adults \n advanced renal cell carcinoma (advanced kidney cancer) in adults \n classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after or has not responded to previous therapies, \n\nincluding an autologous stem-cell transplant (a transplant of your own blood-producing cells) in \nadults \n\n advanced cancer of the head and neck in adults \n advanced urothelial carcinoma (bladder and urinary tract cancer) in adults. \n \nIt contains the active substance nivolumab, which is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein designed \nto recognise and attach to a specific target substance in the body. \n \nNivolumab attaches to a target protein called programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) that can switch off \nthe activity of T cells (a type of white blood cell that forms part of the immune system, the body’s \nnatural defences). By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action and prevents it from switching \noff your T cells. This helps increase their activity against the melanoma, lung, kidney, lymphoid, head \nand neck or bladder cancer cells. \n \nOPDIVO may be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines. It is important that you also \nread the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, \nplease ask your doctor. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use OPDIVO \n \nYou should not be given OPDIVO \n if you are allergic to nivolumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6 \n\n\"Contents of the pack and other information\"). Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n91 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using OPDIVO as it may cause: \n Problems with your heart such as a change in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat or an abnormal \n\nheart rhythm. \n Problems with your lungs such as breathing difficulties or cough. These may be signs of \n\ninflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease). \n Diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or any symptoms of inflammation of the intestines \n\n(colitis), such as stomach pain and mucus or blood in stool. \n Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include abnormal \n\nliver function tests, eye or skin yellowing (jaundice), pain on the right side of your stomach area, \nor tiredness. \n\n Inflammation or problems with your kidneys. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal \nkidney function tests, or decreased volume of urine. \n\n Problems with your hormone producing glands (including the pituitary, the thyroid, the \nparathyroid and adrenal glands) that may affect how these glands work. Signs and symptoms that \nthese glands are not working properly may include fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight change or \nheadache, decreased blood levels of calcium and visual disturbances. \n\n Diabetes (symptoms include excessive thirst, the passing of a greatly increased amount of urine, \nincrease in appetite with a loss of weight, feeling tired, drowsy, weak, depressed, irritable and \ngenerally unwell) or diabetic ketoacidosis (acid in the blood produced from diabetes). \n\n Inflammation of the skin that can lead to severe skin reaction (known as toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Signs and symptoms of severe skin reaction may \ninclude rash, itching, and peeling of the skin (possibly fatal). \n\n Inflammation of the muscles such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), myositis \n(inflammation of the muscles) and rhabdomyolysis (stiffness in muscles and joints, muscle \nspasm). Signs and symptoms may include muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, chest pain, or severe \nfatigue. \n\n Solid organ transplant rejection. \n Graft-versus-host disease. \n Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A rare disease in which our immune system makes too \n\nmany of otherwise normal infection fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. Symptoms \nmay include enlarged liver and/or spleen, skin rash, lymph node enlargement, breathing problems, \neasy bruising, kidney abnormalities, and heart problems. \n\n \nTell your doctor immediately if you have any of these signs or symptoms or if they get worse. Do \nnot try to treat your symptoms with other medicines on your own. Your doctor may \n give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, \n withhold the next dose of OPDIVO, \n or stop your treatment with OPDIVO altogether. \nPlease note that these signs and symptoms are sometimes delayed, and may develop weeks or months \nafter your last dose. Before treatment, your doctor will check your general health. You will also have \nblood tests during your treatment. \n \nCheck with your doctor or nurse before you are given OPDIVO if: \n you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); \n you have melanoma of the eye; \n you were previously given ipilimumab, another medicine for treating melanoma, and experienced \n\nserious side effects because of that medicine; \n you have been told that your cancer has spread to your brain; \n you have any history of inflammation of the lungs; \n you have been taken medicines to suppress your immune system. \n \nComplications of stem cell transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic) after treatment with \nOPDIVO. These complications can be severe and can lead to death. Your healthcare provider will \nmonitor you for signs of complications if you have an allogeneic stem cell transplant. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n\nChildren and adolescents \nOPDIVO should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and OPDIVO \nBefore you are given OPDIVO, tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines that suppress your \nimmune system, such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of \nOPDIVO. However, once you are treated with OPDIVO, your doctor may give you corticosteroids to \nreduce any possible side effects that you may have during your treatment and this will not impact the \neffect of the medicine. \nTell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. Do not take any other \nmedicines during your treatment without talking to your doctor first. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you might be, if you are planning to become pregnant, \nor if you are breast-feeding. \n \nDo not use OPDIVO if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically tells you to. The effects of \nOPDIVO in pregnant women are not known, but it is possible that the active substance, nivolumab, \ncould harm an unborn baby. \n You must use effective contraception while you are being treated with OPDIVO and for at least \n\n5 months following the last dose of OPDIVO, if you are a woman who could become pregnant. \n If you become pregnant while using OPDIVO tell your doctor. \n \nIt is not known whether OPDIVO gets into breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be \nexcluded. Ask your doctor if you can breast-feed during or after treatment with OPDIVO. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOPDIVO or OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab may have a minor influence on the ability to \ndrive and use machines; however, use caution when performing these activities until you are sure that \nOPDIVO does not adversely affect you. \n \nOPDIVO contains sodium \nTell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium (low-salt) diet before you are given OPDIVO. This \nmedicine contains 2.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each mL of concentrate. \nOPDIVO contains 10 mg sodium per 4 ml vial, 25 mg sodium per 10 ml vial or 60 mg sodium per \n24 ml vial, which is equivalent to 0.5%, 1.25% or 3% respectively, of the recommended maximum \ndaily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \nYou will also find key messages from this package leaflet in the patient alert card you have been given \nby your doctor. It is important that you keep this patient alert card and show it to your partner or \ncaregivers. \n \n \n3. How to use OPDIVO \n \nHow much OPDIVO is given \nWhen OPDIVO is given on its own, the recommended dose is either 240 mg given every 2 weeks or \n480 mg given every 4 weeks depending on indication. \n \nWhen OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of skin cancer, the \nrecommended dose of OPDIVO is 1 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of your body weight for the first \n4 doses (combination phase). Thereafter the recommended dose of OPDIVO is 240 mg given every \n2 weeks or 480 mg given every 4 weeks (single-agent phase).  \n \nWhen OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, \nthe recommended dose of OPDIVO is 3 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of your body weight for the \n\n\n\n93 \n\nfirst 4 doses (combination phase). Thereafter, the recommended dose of OPDIVO is 240 mg given \nevery 2 weeks or 480 mg given every 4 weeks (single-agent phase). \n \nWhen OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy for the treatment of \nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer, the recommended dose of OPDIVO is 360 mg every 3 weeks. \nAfter completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy, OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab, the \nrecommended dose of OPDIVO is 360 mg every 3 weeks. \n \nDepending on your dose, the appropriate amount of OPDIVO will be diluted with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection \nbefore use. More than one vial of OPDIVO may be necessary to obtain the required dose. \n \nHow OPDIVO is given \nYou will receive treatment with OPDIVO in a hospital or clinic, under the supervision of an \nexperienced doctor. \n \nOPDIVO will be given to you as an infusion (a drip) into a vein (intravenously) over a period of 30 or \n60 minutes, every 2 weeks or 4 weeks, depending on the dose you are receiving. Your doctor will \ncontinue giving you OPDIVO for as long as you keep benefitting from it or until you no longer \ntolerate the treatment. \n \nWhen OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab, you will be given an infusion over a period \nof 30 minutes, every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses (combination phase). Thereafter it will be given as \nan infusion over a period of 30 or 60 minutes, every 2 weeks or 4 weeks, depending on the dose you \nare receiving (single-agent phase).  \n \nWhen OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy for the treatment of \nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer, you will be given an infusion over a period of 30 minutes, \nevery 3 weeks. \n \nIf you miss a dose of OPDIVO \nIt is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive OPDIVO. If you miss an \nappointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose. \n \nIf you stop using OPDIVO \nStopping your treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. Do not stop treatment with OPDIVO \nunless you have discussed this with your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions about your treatment or on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \nWhen OPDIVO is given in combination with ipilimumab or in combination with ipilimumab and \nchemotherapy, you will first be given OPDIVO followed by ipilimumab and then by chemotherapy. \nPlease refer to the package leaflet of the other anti-cancer medicines in order to understand the use of \nthese medicines. If you have questions about these medicines, please ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Your \ndoctor will discuss these with you and will explain the risks and benefits of your treatment. \n \nBe aware of important symptoms of inflammation.

Based on this prescribed dose, calculate the \ntotal dose to be given. \n \n The total nivolumab dose in mg = the patient’s weight in kg × the prescribed dose in mg/kg.  \n The volume of OPDIVO concentrate to prepare the dose (mL) = the total dose in mg, divided \n\nby 10 (the OPDIVO concentrate strength is 10 mg/mL).  \n \nNivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy: \nThe prescribed dose for the patient is 360 mg given regardless of body weight. \n \nPreparing the infusion \nTake care to ensure aseptic handling when you prepare the infusion. \n \nOPDIVO can be used for intravenous administration either: \n without dilution, after transfer to an infusion container using an appropriate sterile syringe; \nor \n after diluting according to the following instructions:  \n the final infusion concentration should range between 1 and 10 mg/mL. \n the total volume of infusion must not exceed 160 mL. For patients weighing less than 40 kg, \n\nthe total volume of infusion must not exceed 4 mL per kilogram of patient weight. \n \n OPDIVO concentrate may be diluted with either:  \n sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection; or \n 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection.  \n\n \nSTEP 1 \n Inspect the OPDIVO concentrate for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not shake the vial. \n\nOPDIVO concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid. Discard the vial if \nthe solution is cloudy, is discoloured, or contains particulate matter other than a few \ntranslucent-to-white particles. \n\n Withdraw the required volume of OPDIVO concentrate using an appropriate sterile syringe.  \n \nSTEP 2 \n Transfer the concentrate into a sterile, evacuated glass bottle or intravenous container (PVC or \n\npolyolefin).  \n If applicable, dilute with the required volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \n\ninjection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. For ease of preparation, the concentrate \ncan be transferred directly into a pre-filled bag containing the appropriate volume of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. \n\n Gently mix the infusion by manual rotation. Do not shake. \n \nAdministration \nOPDIVO infusion must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. \nAdminister the OPDIVO infusion intravenously over a period of 30 or 60 minutes depending on \nthe dose. \n \nOPDIVO infusion should not be infused at the same time in the same intravenous line with other \nagents. Use a separate infusion line for the infusion. \n \nUse an infusion set and an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size \nof 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm). \n \nOPDIVO infusion is compatible with: \n PVC containers \n Polyolefin containers \n Glass bottles \n\n\n\n101 \n\n PVC infusion sets \n In-line filters with polyethersulfone membranes with pore sizes of 0.2 µm to 1.2 µm. \n \nAfter administration of the nivolumab dose, flush the line with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) \nsolution for injection or 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. \n \nStorage conditions and shelf life \nUnopened vial \nOPDIVO must be stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). The vials must be kept in the original \npackage in order to protect from light. OPDIVO should not be frozen. \nThe unopened vial can be stored at controlled room temperature up to 25°C with room light for up to \n48 hours. \n \nDo not use OPDIVO after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the vial label after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nOPDIVO infusion \nChemical and physical in-use stability from the time of preparation has been demonstrated as follows \n(times are inclusive of the administration period): \n \n\nInfusion preparation \nIn-use stability \n\nStorage at 2ºC to 8ºC \nprotected from light \n\nStorage at room temperature \n(≤ 25°C) and room light \n\nUndiluted or diluted with sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution \nfor injection \n\n30 days 24 hours (of total 30 days storage) \n\nDiluted with 50 mg/mL (5%) \nglucose solution for injection 24 hours \n\n8 hours \n(of total 24 hours storage) \n\n \nFrom a microbiological point of view the prepared solution for infusion, regardless of the diluent, \nshould be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C or \n8 hours (of the total 24 hours of storage) at room temperature (≤ 25°C), unless infusion preparation has \ntaken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nDisposal \nDo not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused medicine or waste \nmaterial should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
