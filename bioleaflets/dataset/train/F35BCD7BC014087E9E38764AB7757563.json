NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZalviso 15 micrograms sublingual tablets  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach sublingual tablet contains 15 micrograms sufentanil (as citrate). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect:  \nEach sublingual tablet contains 0.074 mg sunset yellow FCF Aluminium Lake (E110). \nEach sublingual tablet contains 0.013 mg sodium. \n\n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSublingual tablet.  \n \nZalviso sublingual tablets of 3 mm diameter are orange-coloured flat-faced tablets with rounded edges.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZalviso is indicated for the management of acute moderate to severe post-operative pain in adult \npatients. \n \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nZalviso is to be administered in a hospital setting only. Zalviso should only be prescribed by \nphysicians who are experienced in the management of opioid therapy, particularly opioid adverse \nreactions such as respiratory depression (see section 4.4).  \n \nPosology \n \nZalviso sublingual tablets are to be self-administered by the patient in response to pain using the \nZalviso administration device. The Zalviso administration device is designed to deliver a single \nsufentanil 15 micrograms sublingual tablet, on a patient-controlled as needed basis, with a minimum \nof 20 minutes (lockout interval) between doses, over a period of up to 72 hours, which is the \nmaximum recommended treatment duration. See section \u201cMethod of administration\u201d.  \n \nElderly  \n \nNo special population studies were performed using sufentanil sublingual tablets in elderly patients. In \nclinical trials approximately 30 % of enrolled patients were 65 to 75 years of age. The safety and \nefficacy in elderly patients was similar to that observed in younger adults (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nNo special population studies were performed using sufentanil sublingual tablets in hepatic and renal \nimpaired patients. Only limited data are available for the use of sufentanil in such patients. Zalviso \nshould be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or severe renal \nimpairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Zalviso in children aged below 18 years have not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor sublingual use only.  \n \nThe Zalviso sublingual tablets are to be self-administered using the Zalviso administration device \nwhich should only be actuated by the patient in response to pain (see section 6.6). \n \nThe dispensed sublingual tablet should dissolve under the tongue and should not be crushed, chewed, \nor swallowed. Patients should not eat or drink and minimize talking for 10 minutes after each dose of \nZalviso. \nThe maximum amount of sublingual sufentanil that can be delivered via the Zalviso administration \ndevice over an hour is 45 micrograms (3 doses).  \n \nIn the event of repeated maximal usage by the patient, one cartridge will last for a period of 13 hours \n20 minutes. Additional Zalviso cartridges may be utilized if needed.  \n \nFor instructions on the setup and handling of the Zalviso administration device before administration, \nsee section 6.6. \n \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Significant respiratory depression. \n\n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRespiratory depression \n \nSufentanil may cause respiratory depression, for which the degree/severity is dose related. The \nrespiratory effects of sufentanil should be assessed by clinical monitoring, e. g. respiratory rate, \nsedation level and oxygen saturation. Patients at higher risk are those with respiratory impairment or \nreduced respiratory reserve. Respiratory depression caused by sufentanil can be reversed by opioid \nantagonists. Repeat antagonist administration may be required as the duration of respiratory \ndepression may last longer than the duration of the effect of the antagonist (see section 4.9). \n \nSleep-related breathing disorders \n \nOpioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-\nrelated hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who \npresent with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nIntracranial pressure \n \nSufentanil should be used with caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the cerebral \neffects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired \nconsciousness. Sufentanil may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Sufentanil \nshould be used with caution in patients with brain tumours. \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nSufentanil may produce bradycardia. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients with \nprevious or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias.  \nSufentanil may cause hypotension, especially in hypovolemic patients. Appropriate measures should \nbe taken to maintain stable arterial pressure. \n \nImpaired hepatic or renal function \n \nSufentanil is primarily metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine and faeces. The duration of \nactivity may be prolonged in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment. Only limited data are \navailable for the use of Zalviso in such patients. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic or severe \nrenal impairment should be monitored carefully for symptoms of sufentanil overdose (see section 4.9). \n \n \nAbuse potential and tolerance \n \nSufentanil has potential for abuse. This should be considered when prescribing or administering \nsufentanil where there is concern about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion. \n \nPatients on chronic opioid therapy or opioid addicts may require higher analgesic doses than the \nZalviso administration device can deliver.  \n \nGastrointestinal effects \n \nSufentanil as a \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist may slow the gastrointestinal motility. Therefore, Zalviso \nshould be used with caution in patients at risk of ileus. \n \nSufentanil as a \u00b5-opioid receptor agonist may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Therefore, Zalviso \nshould be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. \n \n \nRisk from concomitant use of sedating medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related \nsubstances \n \nConcomitant use of Zalviso and sedating medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related \nsubstances may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, \nconcomitant prescribing with these sedating medicinal products should be reserved for patients for \nwhom alternative treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe Zalviso \nconcomitantly with sedating medicinal products the duration of the concomitant treatment should be \nas short as possible. \nThe patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and \nsedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their caregivers to be aware \nof these symptoms (see section 4.5). \n \nOther \n \nBefore use, the health-care professional should ensure that the patients have been appropriately \ninstructed on how to operate the Zalviso administration device to self-administer tablets as needed to \n\n\n\n5 \n\nmanage their pain post-operatively. Only patients who are able to understand and follow the \ninstructions to operate the administration device should use Zalviso. The health-care professional \nshould take into consideration the ability (e. g. visual or cognitive) of the patient to use the device \nappropriately. \n \nExcipients \n \nZalviso sublingual tablets contain the azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF Aluminium Lake (E110), \nwhich may cause allergic reactions. \nZalviso sublingual tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium free\u2019. \n\n \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction with cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme  \n \nSufentanil is primarily metabolised by the human cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme. Ketoconazole, a \npotent CYP3A4 inhibitor, can significantly increase the systemic exposure to sublingual sufentanil \n(maximal plasma levels (Cmax) increase of 19 %, overall exposure to the active substance (AUC) \nincrease of 77 %) and prolong the time to reach maximum concentration by 41 %. Similar effects with \nother potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. itraconazol, ritonavir) cannot be excluded. Any change in \nefficacy/tolerability associated with the increased exposure would be compensated in practice by an \nalteration in dosing frequency (see section 4.2). \n \nCentral nervous system (CNS) depressants \n \nThe concomitant use of CNS depressants including barbiturates, neuroleptics or other opioids, halogen \ngases or other non-selective CNS depressants (e.g. alcohol) may enhance respiratory depression.  \n \nSedating medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related substances \n \nThe concomitant use of opioids with sedating medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related \nsubstances increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive \nCNS depressant effect. The duration of the concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). \n \n \nSerotonergic agents \n \nCo-administration of sufentanil with a serotonergic agent, such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake \nInhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), or Monoamine Oxidase \nInhibitors (MAOIs), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life threatening \ncondition. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors must not be taken in the 2 weeks before or at the same time \nas Zalviso is given. \n \nOthers \n \nInteraction with other sublingually administered products or products intended to dilute/establish an \neffect in the oral cavity were not evaluated and simultaneous administration should be avoided. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nThere is insufficient data on the use of sufentanil during human pregnancy to evaluate its potential \nharmful effects. There are no indications to date that the use of sufentanil during pregnancy increases \nthe risk of congenital abnormalities.  \nSufentanil crosses the placenta. \nReproductive toxicity has been shown in animal studies (see section 5.3).  \n \nZalviso is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nSufentanil is excreted in human milk when applied intravenously; therefore caution is advised when \nZalviso is administered to breast-feeding women. Breastfeeding is not recommended when sufentanil \nis administered, due to the risk of opioid effects or toxicity in the breastfed newborns/infants (see \nsection 4.9). \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of sufentanil on fertility in women or men. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSufentanil has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not \nto drive or operate machinery if they experience somnolence, dizziness, or visual disturbance while \ntaking or after the treatment with Zalviso. Patients should only drive and use machines if sufficient \ntime has elapsed after the last administration of Zalviso. \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most serious adverse reaction of sufentanil is respiratory depression, potentially leading to \napnoea and respiratory arrest (see section 4.4). \nBased on the combined safety data from these clinical studies, nausea and vomiting were the most \nfrequently reported adverse reactions (\u22651/10 frequency).  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions identified either from clinical studies or from post-marketing experience with \nother medicinal products containing sufentanil are summarised in the table below. The frequencies \nare defined as: \n\nVery common \u22651/10 \nCommon \u22651/100 and <1/10 \nUncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100 \nRare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000 \nVery rare <1/10,000 \nNot known  Cannot be estimated from the available data \n\n \n \n\nMedDRA system organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\n\n\n7 \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity* Anaphylactic shock  \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Confusional state Apathy* \nNervousness* \n\n \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dizziness \nHeadache \nSedation \n\nSomnolence \nParaesthesia \nAtaxia* \nDystonia* \nHyperreflexia* \n\nConvulsions \nComa  \n\nEye disorders   Vision \ndisturbances \n\nMiosis \n\nCardiac disorders  Heart rate increased Heart rate \ndecreased* \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  Blood pressure \nincreased \nBlood pressure \ndecreased \n\n   \n\nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n Respiratory \ndepression  \n\nApnoea  Respiratory arrest  \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nNausea \nVomiting \n\nConstipation \nDyspepsia \n\nDry mouth \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n \nPruritus Hyperhidrosis \n\nRash  \nDry skin* \n\nErythema  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\n Involuntary muscle \nspasms  \nMuscle twitching*  \n\n  \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n Urinary retention    \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nPyrexia \n \n\nChills \nAsthenia \n\nDrug Withdrawal \nSyndrome \n\n* see \u201cDescription of selected adverse reactions\u201d \n \n \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAfter prolonged use of other substances with \u00b5-opioid receptor activity, symptoms of withdrawal were \nobserved after abrupt interruption of the treatment. \nSome adverse reactions were not observed in the clinical trials with Zalviso. Their frequencies were \nestablished based on data from intravenous administration of sufentanil: common \u2013 muscle twitching; \nuncommon \u2013 hypersensitivity, apathy, nervousness, ataxia, dystonia, hyperreflexia, heart rate \ndecreased and dry skin. \n \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSigns and symptoms \n \nSufentanil overdose is manifested by an exaggeration of its pharmacological effects. Depending on \nindividual sensitivity, the clinical picture is determined by the degree of respiratory depression. This \nmay range from hypoventilation to respiratory arrest. Other symptoms that may occur are loss of \nconsciousness, coma, cardiovascular shock and muscle rigidity. \n \nManagement \n \nManagement of overdose should be focused on treating symptoms of \u00b5-opioid receptor agonism \nincluding administration of oxygen. Primary attention should be given to obstruction of airways and \nthe necessity of assisted or controlled ventilation.  \nAn opiate antagonist (e.g. naloxone) should be administered in the event of respiratory depression. \nThis does not rule out more direct countermeasures. The shorter duration of activity of the opiate \nantagonist compared to sufentanil should be taken into account. In that case, the opioid antagonist can \nbe administered repeatedly or by infusion.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Opioid anaesthetics, ATC Code: N01AH03 \n \n \nMechanism of action \n \nSufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to \u00b5-opioid receptors. Sufentanil \nacts as a full agonist in \u00b5-opioid receptors.  \nSufentanil does not induce histamine release. All effects of sufentanil can immediately and completely \nbe blocked by administration of a specific antagonist such as naloxone. \n \nPrimary pharmacodynamics effects  \n \nAnalgesia \n \nAnalgesia induced by sufentanil is thought to be mediated via activation of \u00b5-opioid receptors \nprimarily within the CNS to alter processes affecting both the perception of and the response to pain. \nIn humans the potency is 7 to 10-fold higher than fentanyl and 500 to 1,000-fold higher than morphine \n(per oral). The high lipophilicity of sufentanil allows it to be administered sublingually and achieve a \nrapid onset of analgesic effect. \n \nSecondary pharmacodynamics effects \n \nRespiratory depression \n \nSufentanil may cause respiratory depression (see section 4.4) and also suppresses the cough reflex.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nOther CNS effects \n \nHigh doses of intravenously administered sufentanil are known to cause muscle rigidity, probably as a \nresult of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus. Hypnotic activity can be \ndemonstrated by EEG alterations.  \n \nGastrointestinal effects \n \nAnalgesic plasma concentrations of sufentanil may provoke nausea and vomiting by irritation of the \nchemoreceptor trigger zone.  \nGastrointestinal effects of sufentanil comprise decreased propulsive motility, reduced secretion and \nincreased muscle tone (up to spasms) of the sphincters of the gastrointestinal tract (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nLow doses of intravenous sufentanil associated with likely vagal (cholinergic) activity cause mild \nbradycardia and mildly reduced systemic vascular resistance without significantly lowering blood \npressure (see section 4.4). \nCardiovascular stability is also the result of minimal effects on cardiac preload, cardiac flow rate and \nmyocardial oxygen consumption. Direct effects of sufentanil on myocardial function were not \nobserved.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nAnalgesia \n \nEfficacy of Zalviso for patient-controlled analgesia was demonstrated in 3 Phase III clinical trials in \nacute post-surgical nociceptive and visceral pain (post-surgical pain following major abdominal or \northopaedic surgery): 2 trials were double-blind placebo-controlled (Zalviso N = 430 patients; placebo \nN = 161 patients) and 1 was an open-label active-controlled (Zalviso N = 177 patients; morphine \nN = 180 patients) trial. \n \nPatients were treated using the Zalviso dosing regimen of 15 micrograms sufentanil sublingually as \nneeded with a minimum 20 minute lock-out interval over a period of 72 hours. \n  \nSuperiority over placebo was demonstrated in the Phase III placebo-controlled trials for the primary \nendpoint time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference from baseline over 48 hours (SPID48; \nP \u22640.001), and the secondary endpoints, time-weighted SPID (P \u22640.004), total pain relief (TOTPAR; P \n\u22640.004), and patients global assessment (P \u22640.007) over 24, 48 and 72 hours. After 48 hours more than \nhalf of the subjects in the Zalviso group had a relevant pain reduction (30 % responder rate) in these \ntrials (visceral pain 60 %, nociceptive pain 54.9 %). \n \nA significantly higher proportion of patients (78.5 %) rated the method of pain control as \u201cgood\u201d or \n\u201cexcellent\u201d with Zalviso than with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia method (65.5 %) \n(primary endpoint at 48 hours; P = 0.007). Patients reported in all the 3 Phase III trials a clinically \nmeaningful pain relief within the first hour of treatment with Zalviso (pain intensity difference to \nbaseline and total pain response >1 NRS). Zalviso was also considered to be easier to use by health-\ncare professionals (P = 0.017). \n \nAs demonstrated in the active-controlled trial, the average time between Zalviso doses was \napproximately double as long as compared to intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia \n(approximately 80 minutes compared to approximately 45 minutes) over the first 48 hours. \nPatients who were treated with Zalviso between 48 and 72 hours in the three controlled trials used a \nwide range of the available 216 doses, with a mean of 49 doses/patient (range of 8-153 doses) with the \nmajority of patients (69.7 %) using between 24 to 72 doses. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nRespiratory depression \n \nAnalgesic doses of Zalviso resulted in respiratory depressive effects in some patients in the clinical \ntrials. In the Phase III active-controlled trial, the magnitude of decrease in oxygen saturation was \ncomparable between Zalviso and i.v. patient-controlled morphine groups. However, there was a \nstatistically significant lower percentage of patients who experienced oxygen desaturation episodes \nfollowing the administration of Zalviso sublingual tablets (19.8 %) with the administration device than \nin the IV PCA morphine group (30.0 %). Clinical trials have shown that sufentanil administered \nintravenously causes less respiratory depression when compared with equianalgesic doses of fentanyl. \n \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of sufentanil after sublingual administration can be described as a three-\ncompartment model with first-order absorption. This route of administration results in higher absolute \nbioavailability by avoiding intestinal and first-pass liver 3A4 enzyme metabolism.  \nMean absolute bioavailability after a single sublingual administration of Zalviso relative to a one-\nminute intravenous sufentanil infusion of 15 micrograms was 59 %. This compares to a substantially \nlower bioavailability of 9 % after oral intake (swallowed). In clinical trials during repeated \nadministrations the bioavailability decreased to 37.6 %. \nBuccal administration study showed an increased bioavailability of 78 % when the tablets were placed \nin front of the front lower teeth.  \nMaximum concentrations of sufentanil are achieved approximately 50 minutes after a single dose; this \nis shortened to approximately 20 minutes following repeat dosing. When Zalviso was administered \nevery 20 minutes, steady state plasma concentrations were achieved after 13 doses. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe central volume of distribution after intravenous application of sufentanil is approximately 14 litres \nand the volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 350 litres. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBiotransformation takes place primarily in the liver and the small intestine. Sufentanil is mainly \nmetabolised in humans by the cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme system (see section 4.5). Sufentanil is \nrapidly metabolised to a number of inactive metabolites, with oxidative N- and O-dealkylation being \nthe major routes of elimination.  \n \nElimination \n \nThe total plasma clearance after single intravenous administration is about 917 l/min. \nApproximately 80 % of the intravenously administered dose of sufentanil is excreted within 24 hours. \nOnly 2 % of the dose is excreted in unchanged form. Clearance is not affected by race, sex, renal \nparameters, hepatic parameters, or concomitant CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nClinically relevant plasma levels are largely determined by the time for the sufentanil plasma \nconcentration to drop from Cmax to 50 % of Cmax after discontinuation of dosing (context sensitive half-\ntime or CST\u00bd) rather than by the terminal half-life. After a single dose, the median CST\u00bd was \n2.2 hours, increasing to a median value of 2.5 h after multiple dosing: the sublingual delivery route \nthus substantially extends the duration of action associated with intravenous sufentanil administration \n(CST\u00bd of 0.14 hours). Similar CST\u00bd values were observed following both single and repeated \nadministration demonstrating that there is a predictable and consistent duration of action after multiple \ndosing of the sublingual tablet. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nAfter single administration of a 15 micrograms sufentanil sublingual tablet, mean terminal phase half-\nlives in the range of 6 to 10 hours have been observed. After multiple administrations, a longer mean \nterminal half-life of up to 18 hours was determined, owing to the higher plasma concentrations of \nsufentanil achieved after repeated dosing and due to the possibility to quantify these concentrations \nover a longer time period.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma sufentanil concentrations following usage of Zalviso \nin patients and healthy volunteers (N = 700), which included 75 patients with moderate and 7 patients \nwith severe renal impairment, did not identify renal function as a significant covariate for clearance. \nHowever, due to the limited number of patients with severe renal impairment studied, Zalviso should \nbe used with caution in such patients (see section 4.4).  \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis for Zalviso in patients and healthy volunteers \n(N = 700), which included 13 patients with moderate and 6 patients with severe hepatic impairment, \nhepatic function was not identified as a significant covariate for clearance. Due to the limited number \nof patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, a potential effect of hepatic dysfunction as \ncovariate on clearance may not have been detected. Therefore, Zalviso should be used with caution in \nsuch patients (see section 4.4).  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data exist for the Zalviso in paediatric patients.  \nThere is limited pharmacokinetic data available in children after intravenous sufentanil administration. \n \nElderly \n \nNo special population studies were performed using Zalviso in the elderly. Pharmacokinetic data from \nintravenous sufentanil administration did not reveal age related differences. In the placebo-controlled \nPhase 3 trials, approximately 20 % of enrolled patients were elderly (\u2265 75 years of age) and \napproximately 30 % of enrolled patients were 65 to 75 years of age. The population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis showed an effect of age with a 27 % decrease in clearance in the elderly people (above 65 \nyears of age). Since this decrease related to age is smaller than the observed inter-subject variability of \n30-40 % in exposure parameters for sufentanil, this effect is not considered to be of clinical relevance, \nparticularly given that Zalviso is only used on an \u2018as-needed\u2019 basis. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetics  \n \nWhen patients titrated themselves to analgesic effect with Zalviso, plasma sufentanil concentrations \naveraged 60-100 pg/ml over two days of use, with no effect based on age or body mass index (BMI), \nor mild to moderate renal or liver impairment.  \n \nPatients with BMI > 30 kg/m2  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis with a BMI as covariate showed that patients with a \nBMI > 30 kg/m2 dosed more frequently. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nSufentanil has been shown to induce opioid-like effects in a variety of laboratory animals (dogs, rats, \nguinea pigs, hamsters) at doses above those inducing analgesia and in two repeat-dose studies with \nsufentanil sublingual tablets administered buccally in Golden Syrian hamster.  \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nSufentanil was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Sufentanil caused embryolethality in rats and rabbits \nwho were treated for 10-30 days during pregnancy with 2.5 times the maximum human dose by \nintravenous administration. The embryolethal effect was considered secondary to the toxicity for the \nmother animal. \nNo negative effects were observed in another study in rats that were treated with 20times the \nmaximum human dose in the period of organogenesis. The preclinical effects were only observed \nfollowing administrations of levels significantly above the maximum human dose, which are therefore \nof little relevance for clinical use. \n \nMutagenicity \n \nThe Ames test revealed no mutagenic activity of sufentanil. In the micronucleus test in female rats, \nsingle intravenous doses of sufentanil as high as 80 \u00b5g/kg (approximately 2.5 times the upper human \nintravenous dose) produced no structural chromosome mutations.  \n  \nCarcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted on sufentanil.  \n \nLocal tolerance  \n \nTwo local tolerance studies were conducted in the hamster cheek pouch with the sufentanil sublingual \ntablets. It was concluded from these studies that Zalviso sublingual tablets have no or minimal \npotential for local irritation. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n31 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nZalviso 15 micrograms sublingual tablets \nSufentanil \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Zalviso is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Zalviso  \n3. How to take Zalviso  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Zalviso  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zalviso is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance of Zalviso is sufentanil, which belongs to a group of strong pain-relieving \nmedicines called opioids. \n \nZalviso is used to treat acute moderate to severe pain after an operation in adults. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zalviso  \n \nDo not take Zalviso: \n- if you are allergic to sufentanil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6).  \n-  if you have severe breathing problems. \n \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before taking Zalviso.  \n \nTell your doctor or nurse before treatment if you:  \n- are suffering from any condition that  affects your breathing (such as asthma, wheezing, or \n\nshortness of breath). As Zalviso may affect your breathing, your doctor or nurse will check your \nbreathing during treatment;  \n\n- have a head injury or brain tumour; \n- have problems with your heart and circulation, especially slow heart rate, irregular heart beats, low \n\nblood volume or low blood pressure; \n- have moderate to severe liver or severe kidney problems, as these organs have an effect on the \n\nway in which your body breaks down and eliminates the medicine; \n- have a history of medicine or alcoholabuse; \n- are regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g. codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, \n\noxycodone); \n- have abnormally slow bowel movements; \n- have a disease of the gall bladder or pancreas. \n \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nSleep-related breathing disorders \nZalviso contains an active substance that belongs to the group of opioids. Opioids can cause sleep-\nrelated breathing disorders, for example central sleep apnea (shallow/pause of breathing during sleep) \nand sleep-related hypoxemia (low level of oxygen in the blood).  \nThe risk of experiencing central sleep apnea is dependent on the dose of opioids. Your doctor may \nconsider decreasing your total opioid dosage if you experience central sleep apnea. \n \nTaking the sublingual tablets with the device \nBefore you start using Zalviso, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Zalviso \nadministration device. You will then be able to take a tablet as needed to relieve your pain. Follow the \ninstructions carefully. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you did not fully understand the instructions or \nare unsure about the correct handling of the administration device.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nZalviso should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Zalviso \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. In particular, \ntell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: \n- Any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Zalviso e.g. \n\nketoconazole, which is used for the treatment of fungal infections.  \n- Any medicines to treat anxiety, tranquillisers or other opioid medicines, as they can increase the \n\nrisk of severe breathing problems. \n- Medicines for the treatment of  depression known as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs). \n\nThese medicines must not be taken in the 2 weeks before or at the same time as Zalviso is given. \n- Medicines for the treatment of  depression known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors \n\n(SSRIs) and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs). It is not recommended to use \nthese medicines at the same time as Zalviso. \n\n- Other medicines which are also taken sublingually (medicines that are placed under the tongue \nwhere they dissolve) or medicines which dilute or take effect in your mouth (e.g. nystatin, a liquid \nor pastilles you hold in your mouth to treat fungus infections), as the effect on Zalviso has not \nbeen studied.  \n\n \nConcomitant use of Zalviso and sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs  \nincreases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may be \nlife-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be considered when other treatment \noptions are not possible.  \nHowever if your doctor prescribes Zalviso together with sedating medicines the duration of \nconcomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor.  \nPlease tell your doctor about all sedating medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor\u2019s dose \nrecommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and \nsymptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. \n\n \nZalviso with alcohol \nDo not drink alcohol while using Zalviso. It can increase the risk of experiencing severe breathing \nproblems. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nZalviso should not be used during pregnancy or if you are a woman of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \n \nSufentanil passes into breast milk and can cause side effects in the breast-fed child. Breastfeeding is \nnot recommended when you take Zalviso. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nDriving and using machines \nZalviso affects your ability to drive or use machines as it may cause sleepiness, dizziness or visual \ndisturbances. You should not drive or operate machinery if you experience any of these symptoms \nwhilst or after being treated with Zalviso. You should only drive and use machines if sufficient time as \nelapsed after your last dose of Zalviso.  \n \nZalviso contains sunset yellow FCF Aluminium Lake (E110) \nZalviso contains the colouring agent sunset yellow FCF Aluminium Lake (E110), which may cause \nallergic reactions. \n \nZalviso contains sodium \nZalviso contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium free\u2019.  \n \n \n \n3. How to take Zalviso \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nThe sublingual tablets are taken using the Zalviso administration device, which is a system that \ndelivers a single dose upon activation. After receiving a dose you will not be able to release another \ndose for 20 minutes and you will not be able to take more than 3 doses in one hour. \n \nThe device will work for 3 days (72 hours), which is also the maximum recommended duration of \nyour treatment. \n \nZalviso is placed under the tongue using the Zalviso administration device. You can control your \ntreatment and should only activate the device when in need of pain relief. \n \nThe tablets dissolve under your tongue and should not be crushed, chewed, or swallowed. You should \nnot eat or drink and should talk as little as possible for 10 minutes after each dose. \n \nZalviso is only to be taken in a hospital setting. It is only prescribed by physicians who are \nexperienced in the use of strong pain killers like Zalviso and know the effects it may have on you, in \nparticular on your breathing (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d above).  \n \nDo not use the device if any component is visibly damaged. \n \nAfter your treatment the medical staff will take the Zalviso administration device and dispose of any \nunused tablets accordingly. The device is constructed so that you will not be able to open it.  \n \nIf you take more Zalviso than you should \nThe administration device will make you wait 20 minutes between doses to prevent you from taking \nmore Zalviso than you should. However, symptoms of overdose include severe breathing problems \nlike slow and shallow breathing, loss of conciousness, extreme low blood pressure, collapse and \nmuscle rigidity. If these start to develop, tell a doctor or nurse immediately. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most serious side effects are severe breathing problems like slow and shallow breathing, which \nmay even lead to stopping breathing or inability to breathe.  \n\n\n\n34 \n\nIn case you experience any of the above mentioned side effects, stop taking Zalviso and tell your \ndoctor or nurse immediately. \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): nausea, vomiting, fever.  \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \nconfusion, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, low blood \npressure, constipation, indigestion, itching of the skin, involuntary muscle cramps, muscle twitching, \ndifficulty passing urine.  \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): allergic reactions, lack of interest or \nemotion, nervousness, sleepiness, abnormal sensation of the skin, problems coordinating muscle \nmovements, muscle contractions, exaggeration of reflexes, vision disturbances, decreased heart rate, \ndry mouth, excessive sweating, rash, dry skin, chills, weakness.  \n \nFrequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): severe allergic \nreactions (anaphylactic shock), convulsion (fits), coma, small pupil size, redness of the skin, \nwithdrawal syndrome.   \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

need to know before you take zalviso", "Section_Content": "do not take zalviso: - if you are allergic to sufentanil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have severe breathing problems. warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or nurse before taking zalviso. tell your doctor or nurse before treatment if you: - are suffering from any condition that

or brain tumour; - have problems with your heart and circulation, especially slow heart rate, irregular heart beats, low blood volume or low blood pressure; - have moderate to severe liver or severe kidney problems, as these organs have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down and eliminates the medicine; - have a history of medicine or alcoholabuse; - are regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g. codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone); - have abnormally slow bowel movements; - have a disease of the gall bladder or pancreas. sleep-related breathing disorders zalviso contains an active substance that belongs to the group of opioids. opioids can cause sleep- related breathing disorders, for example central sleep apnea (shallow/pause of breathing during sleep) and sleep-related hypoxemia (low level of oxygen in the blood). the risk of experiencing central sleep apnea is dependent on the dose of opioids. your doctor may consider decreasing your total opioid dosage if you experience central sleep apnea. taking the sublingual tablets with the device before you start using zalviso, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the zalviso administration device. you will then be able to take a tablet as needed to relieve your pain. follow the instructions carefully. talk to your doctor or nurse if you did not fully understand the instructions or are unsure about the correct handling of the administration device. children and adolescents zalviso should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years. other medicines and zalviso tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. in particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: - any medicines that might have an effect on

(snris). it is not recommended to use these medicines at the same time as zalviso. - other medicines which are also taken sublingually (medicines that are placed under the tongue where they dissolve) or medicines which dilute or take effect in your mouth (e.g. nystatin, a liquid or pastilles you hold in your mouth to treat fungus infections), as the effect on zalviso has not been studied. concomitant use of zalviso and sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may be life-threatening. because of this, concomitant use should only be considered when other treatment options are not possible. however if your doctor prescribes zalviso together with sedating medicines the duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. please tell your doctor about all sedating medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor's dose recommendation closely. it

medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. check with your doctor if you are not sure. the sublingual tablets are taken using the zalviso administration device, which is a system that delivers a single dose upon activation. after receiving a dose you will not be able to release another dose for 20 minutes and you will not be able to take more than 3 doses in one hour. the device will work for 3 days (72 hours), which is also the maximum recommended duration of your treatment. zalviso is placed under the tongue using the zalviso administration device. you can control your treatment and should only activate the device when in need of pain relief. the tablets dissolve under your tongue and should not be crushed, chewed, or swallowed. you should not eat or drink and should talk as little as possible for 10 minutes after each dose. zalviso is only to be taken in a hospital setting. it is only prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the use of strong pain killers like zalviso and know the effects it may have on you, in particular on your breathing (see \"warnings and precautions\" above). do not use the device if any component is visibly damaged. after your treatment the medical staff will take the zalviso administration device and dispose of any unused tablets accordingly. the device is constructed so that you will not be able to open it. if you take more zalviso than you should the administration device will make you wait 20 minutes between doses to prevent you from taking more zalviso than you should. however, symptoms of overdose include severe breathing problems like slow and shallow breathing, loss of conciousness, extreme low blood pressure, collapse and muscle rigidity. if these start to develop, tell a doctor or nurse immediately. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zalviso", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text":
