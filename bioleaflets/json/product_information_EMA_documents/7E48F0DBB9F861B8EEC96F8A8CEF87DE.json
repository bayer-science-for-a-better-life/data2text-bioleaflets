NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nalli 60 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains 60 mg orlistat. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \nThe capsule has a dark blue centre band, and a turquoise cap and body bearing the imprint of “alli”. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nalli is indicated for weight loss in adults who are overweight (body mass index, BMI, ≥28 kg/m2) and \nshould be taken in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric, lower-fat diet. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended treatment dose is one 60 mg capsule to be taken three times daily. No more than \nthree 60 mg capsules should be taken in 24 hours. \n \nDiet and exercise are important parts of a weight loss programme. It is recommended that a diet and \nexercise programme is started before beginning treatment with alli. \n \nWhile taking orlistat, the patient should be on a nutritionally balanced, mildly hypocaloric diet that \ncontains approximately 30% of calories from fat (e.g. in a 2,000 kcal/day diet, this equates to <67 g \nof fat). The daily intake of fat, carbohydrate and protein should be distributed over three main meals. \n \nThe diet and exercise programme should continue to be followed when treatment with alli is stopped. \n \nTreatment should not exceed 6 months. \n \nIf patients have been unable to lose weight after 12 weeks of treatment with alli, they should consult \ntheir doctor or a pharmacist. It may be necessary to discontinue treatment. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (>65 years old) \nThere are limited data on the use of orlistat in the elderly. However, as orlistat is minimally absorbed, \nno dose adjustment is necessary in the elderly. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \nThe effect of orlistat in individuals with hepatic and/or renal impairment has not been studied (see \nsection 4.4). However, as orlistat is minimally absorbed, no dose adjustment is necessary in \nindividuals with hepatic and/or renal impairment. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of alli in children below 18 years of age has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe capsule should be taken with water immediately before, during or up to 1 hour after each main \nmeal. If a meal is missed or contains no fat, the dose of orlistat should be omitted. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n• Concurrent treatment with ciclosporin (see section 4.5) \n• Chronic malabsorption syndrome \n• Cholestasis \n• Pregnancy (see section 4.6) \n• Breast-feeding (see section 4.6) \n• Concurrent treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGastrointestinal symptoms \n \nPatients should be advised to adhere to the dietary recommendations they are given (see section 4.2). \nThe possibility of experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase when orlistat \nis taken with an individual meal or a diet high in fat. \n \nFat-soluble vitamins \n \nTreatment with orlistat may potentially impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) \n(see section 4.5). For this reason, a multivitamin supplement should be taken at bedtime. \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products \n \nAs weight loss may be accompanied by improved metabolic control in diabetes, patients who are \ntaking a medicinal product for diabetes should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli, in \ncase it is necessary to adjust the dose of the antidiabetic medicinal product. \n \nMedicinal products for hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia \n \nWeight loss may be accompanied by an improvement in blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Patients \nwho are taking a medicinal product for hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia should consult a doctor \nor pharmacist when taking alli, in case it is necessary to adjust the dose of these medicinal products. \n \nAmiodarone \n \nPatients who are taking amiodarone should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli (see \nsection 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRectal bleeding \n \nCases of rectal bleeding have been reported in patients taking orlistat. If this occurs, the patient should \nconsult a doctor. \n \nOral contraceptives \n \nThe use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral \ncontraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5). \n \nKidney disease \n \nPatients with kidney disease should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli, as the use of \norlistat may be associated with hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy leading sometimes to renal \nfailure. This risk is increased in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease and/or volume \ndepletion. \n \nLevothyroxine \n \nHypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur when orlistat and levothyroxine \nare co-administered (see section 4.5). Patients taking levothyroxine should consult a doctor before \nstarting treatment with alli, as orlistat and levothyroxine may need to be taken at different times and \nthe dose of levothyroxine may need to be adjusted. \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products \n \nPatients taking an antiepileptic medicinal product should consult a doctor before starting treatment \nwith alli, as they should be monitored for possible changes in the frequency and severity of \nconvulsions. If this occurs, consideration could be given to administering orlistat and antiepileptic \nmedicinal products at different times (see section 4.5). \n \nAntiretrovirals for HIV \n \nPatients should consult a physician before taking alli concomitantly with antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts. Orlistat may potentially reduce the absorption of antiretroviral medicinal products for HIV \nand could negatively affect the efficacy of antiretroviral medicinal products for HIV (see section 4.5). \n \nInformation concerning excipients \n \nalli 60 mg hard capsules contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCiclosporin \n \nA decrease in ciclosporin plasma levels has been observed in a drug-drug interaction study and also \nreported in several cases, when orlistat was administered concomitantly. This could potentially lead to \na decrease of immunosuppressive efficacy. Concurrent use of alli and ciclosporin is contraindicated \n(see section 4.3). \n \nOral anticoagulants \n \nWhen warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are given in combination with orlistat, international \nnormalised ratio (INR) values could be affected (see section 4.8). Concurrent use of alli and warfarin \nor other oral anticoagulants is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nOral contraceptives \n \nThe absence of an interaction between oral contraceptives and orlistat has been demonstrated in \nspecific drug-drug interaction studies. However, orlistat may indirectly reduce the availability of oral \ncontraceptives and lead to unexpected pregnancies in some individual cases. An additional \ncontraceptive method is recommended in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.4). \n \nLevothyroxine \n \nHypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur when orlistat and levothyroxine \nare taken at the same time (see section 4.4). This could be due to a decreased absorption of iodine salts \nand/or levothyroxine. \n \nAntiepileptic medicinal products \n \nConvulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic \nmedicinal products e.g. valproate, lamotrigine, for which a causal relationship to an interaction cannot \nbe excluded. Orlistat may decrease the absorption of antiepileptic medicinal products, leading to \nconvulsions. \n \nAntiretroviral medicinal products \n \nBased on reports from literature and post-marketing experience orlistat may potentially reduce the \nabsorption of antiretroviral medicinal products for HIV and could negatively affect the efficacy of \nantiretroviral medicinal product for HIV (see section 4.4). \n \nFat-soluble vitamins \n \nTreatment with orlistat may potentially impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). \n \nThe vast majority of subjects receiving up to 4 full years of treatment with orlistat in clinical studies \nhad vitamin A, D, E and K and beta-carotene levels that stayed within normal range. However, \npatients should be advised to use a multivitamin supplement at bedtime to help ensure adequate \nvitamin intake (see section 4.4). \n \nAcarbose \n \nIn the absence of pharmacokinetic interaction studies, alli is not recommended to be used by patients \nreceiving acarbose. \n \nAmiodarone \n \nA decrease in plasma levels of amiodarone, when given as a single dose, has been observed in a \nlimited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly. The clinical relevance of \nthis effect in patients receiving amiodarone treatment remains unknown. Patients who are taking \namiodarone should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli. The dose of amiodarone may \nneed to be adjusted during treatment with alli. \n \nAntidepressants, antipsychotics (including lithium) and benzodiazepines \n \nThere are some case reports of reduced efficacy of antidepressants, antipsychotics (including lithium) \nand benzodiazepines coincidental to the initiation of orlistat treatment in previously well controlled \npatients. Therefore orlistat treatment should only be initiated after careful consideration of the possible \nimpact in these patients. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females \nThe use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral \ncontraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nPregnancy \nFor orlistat, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). \n \nalli is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nAs it is not known whether orlistat is secreted into human milk, alli is contraindicated \nduring breast-feeding (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nAnimal studies do not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOrlistat has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdverse reactions to orlistat are largely gastrointestinal in nature and related to the pharmacologic \neffect of the medicinal product on preventing the absorption of ingested fat. \n \nThe gastrointestinal adverse reactions identified from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg of 18 months \nto 2 years duration were generally mild and transient. They generally occurred early in treatment \n(within 3 months) and most patients experienced only one episode. Consumption of a diet low in fat \nwill decrease the likelihood of experiencing adverse gastrointestinal reactions (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: \nvery common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \nThe frequencies of adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use of orlistat are not known as \nthese reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem organ class and frequency Adverse reaction \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nNot known \n\n \n \nDecreased prothrombin and increased INR \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.5) \n\nImmune system disorders \n \nNot known \n\n \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, \nbronchospasm, angioedema, pruritus, rash, and \nurticaria \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n \nCommon \n\n \n \nAnxiety† \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommon \n \n \n \n \nNot known \n\n \nOily spotting \nFlatus with discharge \nFaecal urgency \nFatty oily stool \nOily evacuation \nFlatulence \nSoft stools \n \n \nAbdominal pain \nFaecal incontinence \nLiquid stools \nIncreased defaecation \n \nDiverticulitis \nPancreatitis \nMild rectal bleeding (see section 4.4) \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n \nNot known  \n\n \n \nOxalate nephropathy that may lead to renal failure \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n \nNot known \n\n \n \nHepatitis that may be serious. Some fatal cases or \ncases requiring liver transplantation have been \nreported. \nCholelithiasis \nIncrease in transaminases and in alkaline \nphosphatase \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nNot known \n\n \n \nBullous eruption \n\n \n†It is plausible that treatment with orlistat can lead to anxiety in anticipation of or secondary to \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily for 15 days have \nbeen studied in normal weight and obese subjects without significant clinical findings. In addition, \ndoses of 240 mg three times daily have been administered to obese patients for 6 months. The majority \nof orlistat overdose cases received during post-marketing reported either no adverse reactions or \nadverse reactions that are similar to those reported with recommended doses of orlistat. \n \nIn the event of an overdose, medical advice should be sought. Should a significant overdose of orlistat \noccur, it is recommended that the patient be observed for 24 hours. Based on human and animal \nstudies, any systemic effects attributable to the lipase-inhibiting properties of orlistat should be rapidly \nreversible. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antiobesity preparations, excl. diet products, peripherally acting \nantiobesity products, ATC code: A08AB01. \n \nOrlistat is a potent, specific and long-acting inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases. It exerts its therapeutic \nactivity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active \nserine site of the gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzyme is thus unavailable to \nhydrolyse dietary fat, in the form of triglycerides, into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. \nFrom clinical studies, it has been estimated that orlistat 60 mg taken three times daily blocks the \nabsorption of approximately 25% of dietary fat. The effect of orlistat results in an increase in faecal fat \nas early as 24 to 48 hours after dosing. Upon discontinuation of therapy, faecal fat content returns to \npre-treatment levels, usually within 48 to 72 hours. \n \nTwo double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥28 kg/m2 support the \nefficacy of orlistat 60 mg taken three times daily in conjunction with a hypocaloric, lower-fat diet. The \nprimary parameter, change in body weight from baseline (time of randomisation), was assessed for \nbody weight over time (Table 1) and the percentage of subjects who lost ≥5% or ≥10% of body weight \n(Table 2). Although weight loss was assessed during 12 months of treatment in both studies, most \nweight loss occurred within the first 6 months. \n \n\nTable 1: Effect of 6 months treatment on body weight measured at baseline \n Treatment group N Relative mean change \n\n(%) \nMean change \n\n(kg) \nStudy 1 Placebo \n\nOrlistat 60 mg \n204 \n216 \n\n-3.24 \n-5.55 \n\n-3.11 \n-5.20 a \n\nStudy 2 Placebo \nOrlistat 60 mg \n\n183 \n191 \n\n-1.17 \n-3.66 \n\n-1.05 \n-3.59 a \n\nPooled data Placebo \nOrlistat 60 mg \n\n387 \n407 \n\n-2.20 \n-4.60 \n\n-2.09 \n-4.40 a \n\na p<0.001 versus placebo \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nTable 2: Responder analysis at 6 months \n Lost ≥5% of baseline body weight (%) Lost ≥10% of baseline body weight \n\n(%) \n Placebo Orlistat 60 mg Placebo Orlistat 60 mg \n\nStudy 1 30.9 54.6 a 10.3 21.3 b \nStudy 2 21.3 37.7 a 2.2 10.5 b \n\nPooled data 26.4 46.7 a 6.5 16.2 a \nComparison versus placebo: a p<0.001; b p<0.01 \n \nThe weight loss induced by orlistat 60 mg conferred other important health benefits after 6 months of \ntreatment in addition to weight loss. The mean relative change in total cholesterol was -2.4% for \norlistat 60 mg (baseline 5.20 mmol/l) and +2.8% for placebo (baseline 5.26 mmol/l). The mean \nrelative change in LDL cholesterol was -3.5% for orlistat 60 mg (baseline 3.30 mmol/l) and +3.8% for \nplacebo (baseline 3.41 mmol/l). For waist circumference, the mean change was -4.5 cm for \norlistat 60 mg (baseline 103.7 cm) and -3.6 cm for placebo (baseline 103.5 cm). All comparisons \nagainst placebo were statistically significant. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nStudies in normal weight and obese volunteers have shown that the extent of absorption of orlistat was \nminimal. Plasma concentrations of intact orlistat were non-measurable (<5 ng/ml) 8 hours following \noral administration of orlistat 360 mg. \n \nIn general, at therapeutic doses, detection of intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations \nwere extremely low (<10 ng/ml or 0.02 µmol), with no evidence of accumulation, which is consistent \nwith minimal absorption. \n \nDistribution \nThe volume of distribution cannot be determined because the active substance is minimally absorbed \nand has no defined systemic pharmacokinetics. In vitro, orlistat is >99% bound to plasma proteins \n(lipoproteins and albumin were the major binding proteins). Orlistat minimally partitions into \nerythrocytes. \n \nBiotransformation \nBased on animal data, it is likely that the metabolism of orlistat occurs mainly within the \ngastrointestinal wall. Based on a study in obese patients, of the minimal fraction of the dose that was \nabsorbed systemically, two major metabolites, M1 (4-member lactone ring hydrolysed) and \nM3 (M1 with N-formyl leucine moiety cleaved), accounted for approximately 42% of the total plasma \nconcentration. \n \nM1 and M3 have an open beta-lactone ring and extremely weak lipase inhibitory activity (1,000- \nand 2,500-fold less than orlistat, respectively). In view of this low inhibitory activity and the low \nplasma levels at therapeutic doses (average of 26 ng/ml and 108 ng/ml, respectively), these \nmetabolites are considered to be pharmacologically inconsequential. \n \nElimination \nStudies in normal weight and obese subjects have shown that faecal excretion of the unabsorbed active \nsubstance was the major route of elimination. Approximately 97% of the administered dose was \nexcreted in faeces and 83% of that as unchanged orlistat. \n \nThe cumulative renal excretion of total orlistat-related materials was <2% of the given dose. The time \nto reach complete excretion (faecal plus urinary) was 3 to 5 days. The disposition of orlistat appeared \nto be similar between normal weight and obese volunteers. Orlistat, M1 and M3 are all subject to \nbiliary excretion. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to fertility, \nreproduction and development. \nThe medicinal use of orlistat is unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic or terrestrial environment. \nHowever, any possible risk should be avoided (see section 6.6). \n \n \n6.

What alli is and what it is used for \n \nalli 60 mg hard capsules (orlistat) is a peripherally acting antiobesity product which is used for weight \nloss in adults aged 18 and over who are overweight, and have a body mass index (BMI) of 28 or \nabove. alli should be used along with a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet. \n \nBMI is a way to find out if you have a healthy weight, or are overweight, for your height. The chart \nbelow will help you find out whether you are overweight and whether alli is right for you. \n \nFind your height on the chart. If you weigh less than the weight shown for your height, do not take \nalli. \n \n\nHeight Weight  Height Weight \n\n1.50 m 63 kg  4' 10'' 9 st 8 lbs \n1.55 m 67.25 kg  5' 0'' 10 st 3 lbs \n1.60 m 71.75 kg  5' 2'' 10 st 13 lbs \n1.65 m 76.25 kg  5' 4'' 11 st 9 lbs \n1.70 m 81 kg  5' 6'' 12 st 5 lbs \n1.75 m 85.75 kg  5' 8'' 13 st 2 lbs \n1.80 m 90.75 kg  5' 10'' 13 st 13 lbs \n1.85 m 95.75 kg  6' 0'' 14 st 10 lbs \n1.90 m 101 kg  6' 2'' 15 st 8 lbs \n\n \nRisk of being overweight \n \nBeing overweight increases your risk of developing several serious health problems such as diabetes \nand heart disease. These conditions may not cause you to feel unwell so you should see your doctor \nfor a general health check. \n \nHow alli works \n \nThe active substance (orlistat) in alli is designed to target fat in your digestive system. It stops about a \nquarter of the fat in your meals from being absorbed. This fat will pass out of the body in your stools \n(see section 4). It is therefore important that you commit to a lower-fat diet to manage these effects. If \nyou do, the action of the capsules will assist your efforts by helping you to lose more weight compared \nto dieting alone. For every 2 kg (4 lb) you lose from dieting alone, alli might help you lose up to 1 kg \n(2 lb) more. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take alli \n \nDo not take alli \nIf you are allergic to orlistat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding. \n- If you are taking ciclosporin, used after organ transplants, for severe rheumatoid arthritis and \n\nsome severe skin conditions. \n- If you are taking warfarin or other medicines used to thin the blood. \n- If you have cholestasis (condition where the flow of bile from the liver is blocked). \n- If you have problems absorbing food (chronic malabsorption syndrome) diagnosed by a doctor. \n \nWarning and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking alli. \n \n- If you have diabetes. Tell your doctor who may need to adjust your anti-diabetic medicine. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n- If you have kidney disease. Talk to your doctor before taking alli if you have problems with \n\nyour kidneys. The use of orlistat may be associated with kidney stones in patients suffering \nfrom chronic kidney disease. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nThis medicine must not be taken by children and adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and alli \n \nalli may affect some medicines you have to take. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nDo not take alli with these medicines \n- Ciclosporin: ciclosporin is used after organ transplants, for severe rheumatoid arthritis and some \n\nsevere skin conditions. \n- Warfarin or other medicines used to thin the blood. \n \nThe oral contraceptive pill and alli \n- The oral contraceptive pill may be less effective if you get severe diarrhoea. Use an extra \n\nmethod of contraception if you get severe diarrhoea. \n \nTake a multivitamin every day if you are taking alli \n- alli can lower the levels of some vitamins absorbed by your body. The multivitamin should \n\ncontain vitamins A, D, E and K. You should take the multivitamin at bedtime, when you will \nnot be taking alli, to help ensure that the vitamins are absorbed. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor before taking alli if you are taking \n- amiodarone, used for heart rhythm problems. \n- acarbose, (an anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus). alli is not \n\nrecommended for people taking acarbose. \n- a thyroid medicine (levothyroxine) as it may be necessary to adjust your dose and take your \n\nmedicines at different times of the day. \n- a medicine for epilepsy as any changes in the frequency and severity of your convulsions should \n\nbe discussed with your doctor. \n- medicines to treat HIV. It is important that you consult your doctor before taking alli if you are \n\nreceiving treatment for HIV. \n- medicines for depression, psychiatric disorders or anxiousness. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist when taking alli \n- If you are taking a medicine for high blood pressure as it may be necessary to adjust your dose. \n- If you are taking a medicine for high cholesterol as it may be necessary to adjust your dose. \n \nalli with food and drink \n \nalli should be used along with a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet. Try to start this diet before beginning \ntreatment. For information on how to set your calorie and fat targets, see Further helpful information \nin the blue pages in section 6. \n \nalli can be taken immediately before, during a meal or up to one hour after a meal. The capsule should \nbe swallowed with water. This usually means one capsule at breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you miss a \nmeal, or your meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli does not work unless there is some fat in \nthe meal. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\nIf you eat a high-fat meal, do not take more than the recommended dose. Taking the capsule with a \nmeal containing too much fat may increase your chance of getting diet-related treatment effects (see \nsection 4). Make every effort to avoid any high-fat meals while taking alli. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not take alli if you are pregnant or breast-feeding \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nalli is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nalli contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to take alli \n \nPreparing to lose weight \n \n1. Choose your start date \n \nChoose the day you will start taking the capsules ahead of time. Before you start taking the capsules, \nbegin your reduced calorie, lower-fat diet and give your body a few days to adjust to your new eating \nhabits. Keep a record of what you are eating in a food diary. Food diaries are effective, because they \nmake you aware of what you are eating, how much you eat, and give you the basis to make changes. \n \n2. Decide on your weight loss goal \n \nThink about how much weight you want to lose and then set a target weight. A realistic goal is to lose \nbetween 5% to 10% of your starting weight. The amount of weight you lose may vary from week to \nweek. You should aim to lose weight at a gradual, steady pace of about 0.5 kg (1 lb) per week. \n \n3. Set your calorie and fat targets \n \nTo help you reach your weight-loss goal you need to set two daily targets, one for calories and one for \nfat. For further advice see Further helpful information in the blue pages in section 6. \n \nTaking alli \n \nAdults 18 and over \n- Take one capsule, three times a day. \n- Take alli just before, during or up to one hour after meals. This usually means one capsule at \n\nbreakfast, lunch and dinner. Make sure your three main meals are well balanced, reduced \ncalorie, and lower-fat. \n\n- If you miss a meal, or your meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli does not work unless \nthere is some fat in the meal. \n\n- Swallow the capsule whole with water. \n- Do not take more than 3 capsules a day. \n- You can keep your daily dose of alli in the blue carry case (shuttle) included in this pack. \n- Eat lower-fat meals to reduce the chance of diet-related treatment effects (see section 4). \n- Try to be more physically active before you start taking the capsules. Physical activity is an \n\nimportant part of a weight loss programme. Remember to check with your doctor first if you \nhave not exercised before. \n\n- Continue to be active while taking alli and after you stop taking it. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nHow long should I take alli for? \n \n- alli should not be taken for more than six months. \n- If you do not lose weight after taking alli for 12 weeks, see your doctor or pharmacist for \n\nadvice. You may need to stop taking alli. \n- Successful weight loss is not just about eating differently for a short period of time before \n\nreverting to your old habits. People who lose weight and maintain the loss make lifestyle \nchanges, which include changes to what they eat and how active they are. \n\n \nIf you take more alli than you should \n \nDo not take more than 3 capsules a day. \n\n If you have taken too many capsules, contact a doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to take alli \n \nIf you miss taking a capsule: \n \n- If it is less than an hour since your last main meal, take the missed capsule. \n- If it is more than an hour since your last main meal, do not take the missed capsule. Wait and \n\ntake the next capsule around your next main meal as usual. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \nMost of the common side effects related to alli (for example, wind with or without oily spotting, \nsudden or more frequent bowel motions and soft stools) are caused by the way it works (see section 1). \nEat lower-fat meals to help manage these diet-related treatment effects. \n \nSerious side effects \nIt is not known how frequently these side effects occur \n \nSevere allergic reactions \n- Signs of a severe allergic reaction include: severe breathing difficulties, sweating, rash, itching, \n\nswollen face, rapid heart beat, collapse. \n Stop taking the capsules. Get medical help immediately. \n \nOther serious side effects \n- Bleeding from the back passage (rectum) \n- Diverticulitis (inflammation of the large intestine). Symptoms may include lower stomach \n\n(abdominal) pain, particularly on the left side, possibly with fever and constipation \n- Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Symptoms may include severe abdominal pain \n\nsometimes radiating towards the back, possibly with fever, nausea and vomiting \n- Skin blistering (including blisters that burst) \n- Severe stomach pain caused by gallstones. \n- Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). Symptoms can include yellowing skin and eyes, itching, \n\ndark coloured urine, stomach pain and liver tenderness(indicated by pain under the front of the \nrib cage on your right hand side), sometimes with loss of appetite. \n\n- Oxalate nephropathy (build up of calcium oxalate which may lead to kidney stones). See \nsection 2, warnings and precautions. \n\n Stop taking the capsules. Tell your doctor if you get any of these. \n \nVery common side effects  \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\n\n\n32 \n\n- Wind (flatulence), with or without oily spotting \n- Sudden bowel motions \n- Fatty or oily stools \n- Soft stools \n Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects gets severe or troublesome. \n \nCommon side effects \nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n- Stomach (abdominal) pain \n- Incontinence (stools) \n- Runny/liquid stools \n- More frequent bowel motions \n- Anxiety \n Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects gets severe or troublesome. \n \nEffects seen in blood tests \nIt is not known how frequently these effects occur (frequency cannot be estimated from the available \ndata) \n- Increases in the levels of some liver enzymes \n- Effects on blood clotting in people taking warfarin or other blood-thinning (anti-coagulant) \n\nmedicines \n Tell your doctor that you are taking alli when you have a blood test. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not \nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \nmedicine. \n \nLearn to deal with alli effects related to your diet or fat intake \n \nThe most common side effects are caused by the way the capsules work and result from some of the \nfat being passed out of your body. Such effects typically occur within the first few weeks of using the \ncapsules, before you may have learnt to limit the amount of fat in your diet. Such diet-related \ntreatment effects may be a signal that you have eaten more fat than you should have done. \n \nYou can learn to minimise the impact of diet-related treatment effects by following these guidelines: \n- Start your lower-fat diet a few days, or even a week, before you begin taking the capsules. \n- Find out more about how much fat your favourite foods typically contain, and the size of your \n\nportions. By familiarising yourself with portions you will be less likely to accidentally exceed \nyour fat target. \n\n- Distribute your fat allowance evenly across your meals for the day. Do not “save up” fat and \ncalorie allowances and then splurge on a high-fat meal or dessert, as you may have done on \nother weight loss programmes. \n\n- Most users who experience these effects find that they can manage and control them by \nadjusting their diet. \n\nDo not be concerned if you do not experience any of these problems. This does not mean that the \ncapsules are not working. \n \n \n5. How to store alli \n \n- Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n- Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle after \n\n“EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n- Do not store above 25°C. \n- Keep the container tightly closed to protect from moisture. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n33 \n\n- The bottle contains two sealed canisters containing silica gel to keep the capsules dry. Keep the \ncanisters in the bottle. Do not swallow them. \n\n- You can also keep your daily dose of alli in the blue carry case (shuttle) included in this pack. \nDiscard any capsules stored in the carry case for more than one month. \n\n- Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist \nhow to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the \nenvironment. \n\n \n \n6.

The capsules work by preventing some \nof the fat you eat from being absorbed but you can still eat foods from all the main food groups. \nAlthough you should focus on the calories and fat that you eat, it is important to eat a balanced diet. \nYou should choose meals which contain a range of different nutrients and learn to eat healthily for the \nlong term. \n \nUnderstanding the importance of calorie and fat targets \n \nCalories are a measurement of the energy your body needs. They are sometimes called kilocalories or \nkcal. Energy may also be measured in kilojoules, which you may also see on food labels. \n- The calorie target is the maximum number of calories you will eat each day. See the chart \n\nfurther on in this section. \n- Your fat gram target is the maximum number of grams of fat you will eat in each meal. The fat \n\ngram target chart follows the information below on setting your calorie target. \n- Controlling your fat target is essential because of the way the capsules work. Taking alli means \n\nyour body will pass more fat through, and therefore may struggle to cope with eating as much \nfat as before. So by meeting your fat target, you will maximise weight loss results while \nminimising the risk of diet-related treatment effects. \n\n- You should aim to lose weight gradually and steadily. Losing around 0.5 kg (1 lb) per week is \nideal. \n\n \nHow to set your calorie target \n \nThe following table has been worked out so that it gives you a calorie target that is about 500 calories \nfewer per day than your body needs to maintain your current weight. That adds up to 3500 fewer \ncalories per week, about the number of calories in 0.5 kg (1 lb) of fat. \n \nYour calorie target alone should allow you to lose weight at a gradual, steady pace of about 0.5 kg \n(1 lb) per week, without feeling frustrated or deprived. \n \nEating fewer than 1200 calories per day is not recommended. \n \nYou will need to know your activity level to set your calorie targets. The more active you are, the \nhigher your calorie target. \n- Low activity means you do little or no walking, climbing stairs, gardening, or other physical \n\nactivity on a daily basis. \n- Moderate activity means you burn around 150 calories per day in physical activity, for example, \n\nwalking three kilometres (2 miles), gardening for 30 to 45 minutes, or running two kilometres \n(1.25 miles) in 15 minutes. Choose the level that most closely fits your daily routine. If you are \nunsure which level you are, choose Low activity. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \nWomen \nLow activity Below 68.1 kg Below 10 st 10 lb 1200 calories \n\n68.1 kg to 74.7 kg 10 st 10 lb to 11 st 11 lb 1400 calories \n74.8 kg to 83.9 kg 11 st 12 lb to 13 st 2 lb 1600 calories \n84.0 kg and over 13 st 3 lb and over 1800 calories \n\nModerate \nactivity \n\nBelow 61.2 kg Below 9 st 9 lb 1400 calories \n61.3 kg to 65.7 kg 9 st 9 lb to 10 st 4 lb 1600 calories \n65.8 kg and over 10 st 5 lb and over 1800 calories \n\n \nMen \nLow activity Below 65.7 kg Below 10 st 4 lb 1400 calories \n\n65.8 kg to 70.2 kg 10 st 5 lb to 11 st 1600 calories \n70.3 kg and over 11 st 1 lb and over 1800 calories \n\nModerate \nactivity \n\n59.0 kg and over 9 st 4 lb and over 1800 calories \n\n \nHow to set your fat target \n \nThe following chart shows how to set your fat target based on the amount of calories you are allowed \nper day. You should plan to have three meals per day. If you have set a target of 1400 calories per day, \nfor example, the maximum amount of fat allowed per meal would be 15 g. To stay within your daily \nallowance for fat, snacks should contain no more than 3 g of fat. \n \nAmount of calories you can eat \nper day \n\nMaximum amount of fat allowed \nper meal \n\nMaximum amount of fat \nallowed from snacks per \nday \n\n1200 12 g 3 g \n1400 15 g 3 g \n1600 17 g 3 g \n1800 19 g 3 g \n \nRemember \n \n- Stick to realistic calorie and fat targets as this is a good way of maintaining your weight loss \n\nachievements in the long-term. \n- Write down what you eat in a food diary, including the calorie and fat content. \n- Try to be more physically active before you start taking the capsules. Physical activity is an \n\nimportant part of a weight loss programme. Remember to check with your doctor first if you \nhave not exercised before. \n\n- Continue to be active while taking alli and after you stop taking it. \n \nThe alli weight loss programme combines the capsules with an eating plan and a wide range of \nresources to help you understand how to eat a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet and guidelines for \nbecoming more active. \n \nThe alli website (please refer to your country specific website included in the list of local \nrepresentatives above) provides you with a range of interactive tools, lower-fat recipes, physical \nactivity tips and other useful information to help you lead a healthy life and to support you in meeting \nyour weight loss goals. \n \nVisit <www.xxx.xxx> \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
