This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOnpattro 2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL contains patisiran sodium equivalent to 2 mg patisiran. \n \nEach vial contains patisiran sodium equivalent to 10 mg patisiran formulated as lipid nanoparticles. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach mL of concentrate contains 3.99 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nWhite to off-white, opalescent, homogeneous solution (pH: 6.3 – 7.5). \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOnpattro is indicated for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR \namyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated under the supervision of a physician knowledgeable in the management of \namyloidosis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Onpattro is 300 micrograms per kg body weight administered via \nintravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 weeks. \n \nDosing is based on actual body weight. For patients weighing ≥ 100 kg, the maximum recommended \ndose is 30 mg. \n \nVitamin A supplementation at approximately 2500 IU vitamin A per day is advised for patients treated \nwith Onpattro (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRequired premedication \nAll patients should receive premedication prior to Onpattro administration to reduce the risk of \ninfusion-related reactions (IRRs) (see section 4.4). Each of the following medicinal products should be \ngiven on the day of Onpattro infusion at least 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion: \n• Intravenous corticosteroid (dexamethasone 10 mg, or equivalent) \n• Oral paracetamol (500 mg) \n• Intravenous H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg, or equivalent) \n• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, or equivalent) \n \nFor premedications not available or not tolerated intravenously, equivalents may be administered \norally. \n \nIf clinically indicated, the corticosteroid may be tapered in decrements no greater than 2.5 mg to a \nminimum dose of 5 mg of dexamethasone (IV), or equivalent. The patient should receive at least 3 \nconsecutive IV infusions of Onpattro without experiencing IRRs before each reduction in \ncorticosteroid premedication. \n \nAdditional or higher doses of one or more of the premedications may be administered to reduce the \nrisk of IRRs, if needed (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed, Onpattro should be administered as soon as possible. \n• If Onpattro is administered within 3 days of the missed dose, dosing should be continued \n\naccording to the patient’s original schedule. \n• If Onpattro is administered more than 3 days after the missed dose, dosing should be continued \n\nevery 3 weeks thereafter. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and \nAST > 1 x ULN, or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST). Onpattro has not been studied in \npatients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and should not be used in these patients unless \nthe anticipated clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). \n \nLiver transplant \nOnpattro has not been studied in patients with prior liver transplant; however, no dose adjustments are \nconsidered necessary. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated \nglomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73m2). Onpattro has not been studied in \npatients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease and should not be used in these \npatients unless the anticipated clinical benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Onpattro in children or adolescents < 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOnpattro is for intravenous use. \n• Onpattro must be diluted prior to intravenous infusion (see instructions in section 6.6). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n• A dedicated line with an infusion set containing a 1.2 micron polyethersulfone (PES) in-line \ninfusion filter must be used. The infusion sets and lines must be free of di(2-\nethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). \n\n• The diluted solution of Onpattro should be infused intravenously over approximately 80 minutes \nat an initial infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/min for the first 15 minutes, followed by an \nincrease to approximately 3 mL/min for the remainder of the infusion. The duration of infusion \nmay be extended in the event of an IRR (see section 4.4). \n\n• Onpattro must be administered through a free-flowing venous access line. The infusion site \nshould be monitored for possible infiltration during administration. Suspected extravasation \nshould be managed according to local standard practice for non-vesicants. \n\n• The patient should be observed during the infusion and, if clinically indicated, following the \ninfusion (see section 4.4). \n\n• After completion of the infusion, the intravenous administration set should be flushed with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution to ensure that all medicinal product has been \nadministered. \n\n \nInfusion of Onpattro at home may be considered for patients who have tolerated at least 3 infusions \nwell in the clinic. The decision for a patient to receive home infusions should be made after evaluation \nand recommendation by the treating physician. Home infusions should be performed by a healthcare \nprofessional. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nIRRs have been observed in patients treated with Onpattro. In patients experiencing an IRR, the \nmajority experienced the first IRR within the first 2 infusions (see section 4.8). Across clinical studies, \nthe most common symptoms (reported in ≥ 2% of patients) of IRRs were flushing, back pain, nausea, \nabdominal pain, dyspnoea, and headache. IRRs may also include hypotension and syncope. \n \n \nTo reduce the risk of IRRs, patients should receive premedications on the day of Onpattro infusion, at \nleast 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion (see section 4.2). If an IRR occurs, slowing or \ninterrupting the infusion and institution of medical management (e.g., corticosteroids or other \nsymptomatic treatment) should be considered, as clinically indicated. If the infusion is interrupted, \nresumption of the infusion at a slower infusion rate may be considered after symptoms have resolved. \nThe Onpattro infusion should be discontinued in the case of a serious or life-threatening IRR. \n \nSome patients who experience IRRs may benefit from a slower infusion rate or additional or higher \ndoses of one or more of the premedications with subsequent infusions to reduce the risk of IRRs. \n \nVitamin A deficiency \n \nBy reducing serum TTR protein, Onpattro treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A (retinol) \nlevels (see section 5.1). Serum vitamin A levels below the lower limit of normal should be corrected \nand any ocular symptoms or signs due to vitamin A deficiency should be evaluated prior to initiation \nof treatment with Onpattro. \n \nPatients receiving Onpattro should take oral supplementation of approximately 2500 IU vitamin A per \nday to reduce the potential risk of ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency. Referral for \nophthalmological assessment is recommended if patients develop ocular symptoms suggestive of \n\n\n\n5 \n\nvitamin A deficiency, including reduced night vision or night blindness, persistent dry eyes, eye \ninflammation, corneal inflammation or ulceration, corneal thickening or corneal perforation. \n \nSerum vitamin A levels should not be used to guide vitamin A supplementation during treatment with \nOnpattro (see section 4.5). \n \nDuring the first 60 days of pregnancy, both too high or too low vitamin A levels may be associated \nwith an increased risk of foetal malformation. Therefore, pregnancy should be excluded before \ninitiating Onpattro and women of childbearing potential should practise effective contraception. If a \nwoman intends to become pregnant, Onpattro and vitamin A supplementation should be discontinued \nand serum vitamin A levels should be monitored and have returned to normal before conception is \nattempted. \n \nIn the event of an unplanned pregnancy, Onpattro should be discontinued (see section 4.6). Vitamin A \nsupplementation should be discontinued during the first trimester, unless the pregnant woman has \nclinical signs of vitamin A deficiency. If such signs are present, vitamin A supplementation should not \nexceed 2500 IU per day. Thereafter, vitamin A supplementation of 2500 IU per day should be resumed \nin the second and third trimesters if serum vitamin A levels have not returned to normal, because of \nthe increased risk of vitamin A deficiency in the third trimester. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 3.99 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.2% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed. Onpattro is not expected to be \naffected by inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes or to cause drug-drug interactions, \nexcept for induction and time-dependent inhibition of CYP2B6 in vitro. The net effect on CYP2B6 \nsubstrates (e.g., bupropion and efavirenz) in vivo is unknown. \n \nVitamin A testing \n \nSerum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein, which facilitates transport of vitamin A in the blood. \nTreatment with Onpattro reduces serum TTR levels, which results in reduced levels of retinol binding \nprotein and vitamin A in the serum. However, transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur \nthrough alternative mechanisms in the absence of retinol binding protein. As a result, during treatment \nwith Onpattro, laboratory tests for serum vitamin A do not reflect the total amount of vitamin A in the \nbody and should not be used to guide vitamin A supplementation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nTreatment with Onpattro reduces serum levels of vitamin A. Both too high or too low vitamin A levels \nmay be associated with an increased risk of foetal malformation. Therefore, pregnancy should be \nexcluded before initiation of treatment and women of childbearing potential should use effective \ncontraception. If a woman intends to become pregnant, Onpattro and vitamin A supplementation \nshould be discontinued and serum vitamin A levels should be monitored and have returned to normal \nbefore conception is attempted. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data on the use of Onpattro in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with \nrespect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential teratogenic risk arising from \nunbalanced vitamin A levels, Onpattro should not be used during pregnancy, unless the clinical \n\n\n\n6 \n\ncondition of the woman requires treatment. As a precautionary measure, vitamin A and thyroid \nstimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be obtained early in pregnancy (see section 5.3). Close \nmonitoring of the foetus should be carried out in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, especially \nduring the first trimester (see section 4.4). Women of childbearing potential have to use effective \ncontraception during treatment with Onpattro. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Onpattro is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals \nhave shown excretion of small amounts of the lipid components DLin-MC3-DMA and \nPEG2000-C-DMG in milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nOnpattro, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for \nthe woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of Onpattro on human fertility. No impact on male or female fertility \nwas detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, Onpattro is considered to have no \nor negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently occurring adverse reactions reported in Onpattro-treated patients were peripheral \noedema (29.7%) and infusion-related reactions (18.9%). The only adverse reaction resulting in the \ndiscontinuation of Onpattro was an infusion-related reaction (0.7%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA System Organ \nClass (SOC) by frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order \nof decreasing seriousness. The frequency of the adverse reactions is expressed according to the \nfollowing categories: \n• Very common (≥ 1/10) \n• Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) \n• Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions reported for Onpattro 300 micrograms per kg \nSystem Organ Class Adverse Reaction Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations Bronchitis Common \nSinusitis Common \nRhinitis Common \n\nImmune system disorders Infusion-related reaction Very common \nEar and labyrinth disorders Vertigo Common \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders Dyspnoea Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Dyspepsia Common \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Erythema Common \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nArthralgia Common \nMuscle spasms Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nPeripheral oedema Very common \nExtravasation Uncommon \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nSymptoms of IRRs include, but are not limited to: arthralgia or pain (including back, neck, or \nmusculoskeletal pain), flushing (including erythema of face or skin warm), nausea, abdominal pain, \ndyspnoea or cough, chest discomfort or chest pain, headache, rash, chills, dizziness, fatigue, increased \nheart rate or palpitations, hypotension which may include syncope, hypertension, facial oedema. \n\n \nIn clinical studies, all patients received premedication with a corticosteroid, paracetamol, and H1 and \nH2 blockers to reduce the risk of IRRs. In the double-blind placebo-controlled study, 18.9% of \nOnpattro-treated patients experienced IRRs, compared to 9.1% of placebo-treated patients. In \nOnpattro-treated patients, all IRRs were either mild (95.2%) or moderate (4.8%) in severity. Among \nOnpattro-treated patients who experienced an IRR, 78.6% experienced the first IRR within the first \n2 infusions. The frequency of IRRs decreased over time. Few IRRs led to infusion interruption. IRRs \nresulted in permanent discontinuation of Onpattro in < 1% of patients in clinical studies. For clinical \nmanagement of IRRs, see section 4.4. \n \nPeripheral oedema \nIn the placebo-controlled study, peripheral oedema was reported in 29.7% of Onpattro-treated patients \nand 22.1% of placebo-treated patients. All events were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to \ntreatment discontinuation. In Onpattro-treated patients, the events decreased in frequency over time. \n \nExtravasation \nExtravasation was observed in < 0.5% of infusions in clinical studies. Signs and symptoms included \nphlebitis or thrombophlebitis, infusion or injection site swelling, dermatitis (subcutaneous \ninflammation), cellulitis, erythema or injection site redness, burning sensation, or injection site pain. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAnti-drug antibodies to Onpattro were evaluated by measuring antibodies specific to PEG2000-C-DMG, \na lipid component exposed on the surface of Onpattro. In the placebo-controlled and open-label \nclinical studies, 7 of 194 (3.6%) patients with hATTR amyloidosis developed anti-drug antibodies \nduring treatment with Onpattro. One additional patient had pre-existing anti-drug antibodies. Anti-\ndrug antibody titres were low and transient with no evidence of an effect on clinical efficacy, the \nsafety profile, or the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles of Onpattro. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of \nadverse reactions and given symptomatic treatment, as appropriate. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous System Drugs; ATC code: N07XX12. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nOnpattro contains patisiran, a double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that \nspecifically targets a genetically conserved sequence in the 3’ untranslated region of all mutant and \nwild-type TTR mRNA. Patisiran is formulated as lipid nanoparticles to deliver the siRNA to \nhepatocytes, the primary source of TTR protein in the circulation. Through a natural process called \nRNA interference (RNAi), patisiran causes the catalytic degradation of TTR mRNA in the liver, \nresulting in a reduction of serum TTR protein. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nMean serum TTR was reduced by approximately 80% within 10 to 14 days after a single dose with \n300 micrograms per kg Onpattro. With repeat dosing every 3 weeks, mean reductions of serum TTR \nafter 9 and 18 months of treatment were 83% and 84%, respectively. Serum TTR reduction was \nmaintained with continued dosing. \n \nSerum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein, which facilitates transport of vitamin A in the blood. \nMean reductions in serum retinol binding protein of 45% and serum vitamin A of 62% were observed \nover 18 months (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy of Onpattro was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 225 \nhATTR amyloidosis patients with a TTR mutation and symptomatic polyneuropathy. Patients were \nrandomised 2:1 to receive 300 micrograms per kg Onpattro or placebo via intravenous infusion once \nevery 3 weeks for 18 months. All patients received premedication with a corticosteroid, paracetamol, \nand H1 and H2 blockers. \n \nIn the study, 148 patients received Onpattro and 77 patients received placebo. The median patient age \nat baseline was 62 (range, 24 to 83) years and 74% of patients were male, 26% were female. Thirty-\nnine (39) different TTR mutations were represented; the most common (≥ 5%) were V30M (43%), \nA97S (9%), T60A (7%), E89Q (6%), and S50R (5%). Approximately 10% of patients had the V30M \nmutation and early onset of symptoms (< 50 years of age). At baseline, 46% of patients had stage 1 \ndisease (unimpaired ambulation; mostly mild sensory, motor and autonomic neuropathy in the lower \nlimbs), and 53% had stage 2 disease (assistance with ambulation required; mostly moderate \nimpairment progression to the lower limbs, upper limbs, and trunk). Approximately half (53%) of \npatients had prior treatment with tafamidis meglumine or diflunisal. Forty-nine percent (49%) and \n50% of patients had a New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class of I or II, respectively. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nApproximately half of patients (56%) met pre-defined criteria for cardiac involvement (defined as \nbaseline LV wall thickness ≥ 13 mm with no history of hypertension or aortic valve disease). Patient \ndemographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups, except that a \nhigher proportion of patients in the Onpattro group had a non-V30M mutation (62% vs. 48%). Ninety-\nthree percent (93%) of Onpattro-treated and 62% of placebo-treated patients completed 18 months of \nthe assigned treatment. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to 18 months in modified Neuropathy \nImpairment Score +7 (mNIS+7). This endpoint is a composite measure of motor, sensory, and \nautonomic polyneuropathy including assessments of motor strength and reflexes, quantitative sensory \ntesting, nerve conduction studies, and postural blood pressure, with the score ranging from 0 to \n304 points, where an increasing score indicates worsening impairment. \n \nA statistically significant benefit in mNIS+7 with Onpattro relative to placebo was observed at 18 \nmonths (Table 2). Benefits relative to placebo were also observed across all mNIS+7 components. \nChanges were also seen at 9 months, the first post-baseline assessment in the study, where treatment \nwith Onpattro led to a 16.0-point treatment difference, with a mean change from baseline \nof -2.0 points, compared to an increase of 14.0 points with placebo. In a threshold analysis of mNIS+7 \n(change from baseline of < 0 points), 56.1% of Onpattro-treated patients versus 3.9% of placebo-\ntreated patients experienced improvement in mNIS+7 (p <0.001). \n \nPatients treated with Onpattro experienced statistically significant benefits in all secondary endpoints \ncompared to patients who received placebo (all p <0.001) (Table 2). \n \nThe key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to 18 months in Norfolk Quality of Life-\nDiabetic Neuropathy (QoL-DN) total score. The Norfolk QoL-DN questionnaire (patient-reported) \nincludes domains relating to small fibre, large fibre, and autonomic nerve function, symptoms, and \nactivities of daily living, with the total score ranging from -4 to 136, where an increasing score \nindicates worsening quality of life. At 18 months, a benefit with Onpattro to placebo was observed \nacross all domains of Norfolk QoL-DN, and 51.4% of Onpattro-treated patients experienced an \nimprovement in quality of life (Norfolk QoL-DN change from baseline of < 0 points) compared to \n10.4% of placebo-treated patients. Improvement was observed at 9 months, the first post-baseline \nassessment in the study. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 2: Clinical Efficacy Results from the Placebo-Controlled Study  \n\nEndpointa \n\nBaseline, Mean (SD) \nChange from Baseline at \n\n18 months, LS Mean \n(SEM) \n\n(Onpattro – \nPlacebo) \n\nTreatment \nDifference, \nLS Mean \n(95% CI)  \n\np-value \nOnpattro \n\nN=148 \nPlacebo \n\nN=77 \nOnpattro Placebo \n\nPrimary \n\nmNIS+7b 80.9 (41.5) 74.6 (37.0) −6.0 (1.7) 28.0 (2.6) \n−34.0 \n\n(−39.9, −28.1) \np < 0.001 \n\nSecondary \nNorfolk  \nQoL-DNb 59.6 (28.2) 55.5 (24.3) −6.7 (1.8) 14.4 (2.7) \n\n−21.1 \n(−27.2, −15.0) \n\np < 0.001 \n\nNIS-Wb 32.7 (25.2) 29.0 (23.0) 0.05 (1.3) 17.9 (2.0) \n−17.9 \n\n(−22.3, −13.4) \np < 0.001 \n\nR-ODSc 29.7 (11.5) 29.8 (10.8) 0.0 (0.6) −8.9 (0.9) \n9.0 \n\n(7.0, 10.9) \np < 0.001 \n\n10-metre walk \ntest (m/sec)c 0.80 (0.40) 0.79 (0.32) 0.08 (0.02) −0.24 (0.04) \n\n0.31 \n(0.23, 0.39) \n\np < 0.001 \n\nmBMId 970 (210) 990 (214) −3.7 (9.6) −119 (14.5) \n116 \n\n(82, 149) \np < 0.001 \n\nCOMPASS \n31b 30.6 (17.6) 30.3 (16.4) −5.3 (1.3) 2.2 (1.9) \n\n−7.5 \n(−11.9, −3.2) \n\np < 0.001 \n\nSD, standard deviation; LS mean, least squares mean; SEM, standard error of the mean; CI, confidence interval, \nNIS-W, NIS-weakness (motor strength); R-ODS, Rasch-Built Overall Disability (patient reported ability to \nperform activities of daily living); 10-metre walk test (gait speed); mBMI, modified body mass index (nutritional \nstatus); COMPASS 31, Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (patient reported symptom score) \n \naAll endpoints analysed using the mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) method. \nbA lower number indicates less impairment/fewer symptoms. \ncA higher number indicates less disability/less impairment.  \ndmBMI: body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) multiplied by serum albumin (g/L); a higher number indicates better \nnutritional status; nutritional status favoured Onpattro as early as 3 months. \n\n \nPatients receiving Onpattro experienced similar benefits relative to placebo in mNIS+7 and Norfolk \nQoL-DN score across all subgroups including age, sex, race, region, NIS score, V30M mutation status, \nprior tafamidis meglumine or diflunisal use, disease stage, and patients with pre-defined cardiac \ninvolvement. Patients experienced benefit across all TTR mutations and the full range of disease \nseverity studied. \n \nIn patients with pre-defined cardiac involvement, centrally-assessed echocardiograms showed \ndecreases in LV wall thickness (LS mean difference: −0.9 mm [95% CI −1.7, −0.2]) and longitudinal \nstrain (LS mean difference: −1.37% [95% CI -2.48, -0.27]) with Onpattro treatment relative to \nplacebo. N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 727 ng/L and 711 ng/L at \nbaseline (geometric mean) in Onpattro-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. At 18 \nmonths, the adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline was 0.89 with Onpattro and 1.97 with placebo \n(ratio, 0.45; p < 0.001), representing a 55% difference in favour of Onpattro. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOnpattro in all subsets of the paediatric population in hATTR amyloidosis (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Onpattro were characterised by measuring the plasma \nconcentrations of patisiran and the lipid components DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG. \n \nAbsorption \n \nGreater than 95% of patisiran in the circulation is associated with lipid nanoparticles. At the dose \nregimen of 300 micrograms per kg every 3 weeks, steady state was reached by 24 weeks of treatment. \nThe estimated patisiran mean ± SD steady-state peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration \n(Ctrough), and area under the curve (AUCτ) were 7.15 ± 2.14 µg/mL, 0.021 ± 0.044 µg/mL, and \n184 ± 159 µg·h/mL, respectively. The accumulation of AUCτ was 3.2-fold at steady-state compared to \nthe first dose. \n \nThe estimated DLin-MC3-DMA mean ± SD steady-state Cmax, Ctrough and AUCτ were \n40.2 ± 11.5 µg/mL, 1.75 ± 0.698 µg/mL, and 1403 ± 105 µg·h/mL, respectively. The accumulation of \nAUCτ was 1.76-fold at steady-state compared to the first dose. \n \nThe estimated PEG2000-C-DMG mean ± SD steady-state Cmax, Ctrough and AUCτ were \n4.22 ± 1.22 µg/mL, 0.0236 ± 0.0093 µg/mL, and 145 ± 64.7 µg·h/mL, respectively. There was no \naccumulation of AUCτ at steady-state compared to the first dose. \n \nDistribution \n \nPlasma protein binding of Onpattro is low, with ≤ 2.1% binding observed in vitro with human serum \nalbumin and human α1-acid glycoprotein. At the dose regimen of 300 micrograms per kg every \n3 weeks, the mean ± SD steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of patisiran, DLin-MC3-DMA and \nPEG2000-C-DMG was 0.26 ± 0.20 L/kg, 0.47 ± 0.24 L/kg and 0.13 ± 0.05 L/kg, respectively. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nPatisiran is metabolized by nucleases to nucleotides of various lengths. DLin-MC3-DMA is primarily \nmetabolised to 4-dimethylaminobutyric acid (DMBA) by hydrolysis. There is little to no metabolism \nof PEG2000-C-DMG. \n \nElimination \n \nAt the dose regimen of 300 micrograms per kg every 3 weeks, mean ± SD steady state plasma \nclearance (CLss) of patisiran was 3.0 ± 2.5 mL/h/kg. The mean ± SD terminal elimination half-life \n(t1/2β) of patisiran was 3.2 ± 1.8 days. Less than 1% of patisiran in the administered dose was recovered \nintact in urine. \n \nThe estimated DLin-MC3-DMA mean ± SD steady-state CLss was 2.1 ± 0.8 mL/h/kg. Approximately \n5.5% of DLin-MC3-DMA was recovered after 96 hours as its metabolite (DMBA) in urine. \n \nThe estimated PEG2000-C-DMG mean ± SD steady-state CLss was 2.1 ± 0.6 mL/h/kg. In rats and \nmonkeys, PEG2000-C-DMG is eliminated unchanged in the bile. PEG2000-C-DMG excretion in humans \nwas not measured. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nExposure to patisiran and the lipid components (DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG) increased \nproportionally with increase in dose over the range evaluated in clinical studies (10 to 500 micrograms \nper kg). Patisiran and the lipid components exhibit linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with \nchronic dosing at the dose regimen of 300 micrograms per kg every 3 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) \n \nIncreasing the dose of patisiran resulted in greater TTR reduction, with maximal reductions plateauing \nat patisiran exposures obtained with 300 micrograms per kg every 3 weeks dosing. \n \nInteractions \n \nThe components of Onpattro are not inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes or \ntransporters, except for CYP2B6 (see Section 4.5). Patisiran is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 \nenzymes. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nGender and race \nClinical studies did not identify significant differences in steady state pharmacokinetic parameters or \nTTR reduction according to gender or race (non-Caucasian vs. Caucasian). \n \nWeight \nNo data are available for patients weighing ≥ 110 kg. \n \nElderly patients \nIn the placebo-controlled study, 62 (41.9%) patients treated with Onpattro were ≥ 65 years of age and \n9 (6.1%) patients were ≥ 75 years of age. There were no significant differences in steady state \npharmacokinetic parameters or TTR reduction between patients < 65 years of age and ≥ 65 years of \nage. \n \nHepatic impairment \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses indicated no impact of mild hepatic \nimpairment (bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and AST > 1 x ULN, or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST) \non patisiran exposure or TTR reduction compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Onpattro \nhas not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses indicated no impact of mild or moderate \nrenal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73m2) on patisiran exposure or TTR reduction \ncompared to subjects with normal renal function. Onpattro has not been studied in patients with severe \nrenal impairment or end-stage renal disease. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nGeneral toxicology \n \nLiver and spleen were the primary target organs of toxicity in both rats and monkeys. Intravenous \nadministration of Onpattro led to increases in serum liver markers (ALT, AST, ALP, and/or total \nbilirubin) and histopathology findings in the liver (hepatocellular/single cell necrosis, inflammation, \npigment deposition, and/or monocytic infiltration) at doses > 100 micrograms per kg every 4 weeks \nand > 1.0 mg/kg every 3 weeks in rats and monkeys, respectively. In spleen, lymphoid \natrophy/necrosis and histiocytosis in the white pulp was observed in rats and hypocellularity of the red \npulp was observed in monkeys. \n \nIn general, all findings observed at the end of dosing in the rat and monkey toxicity studies had either \na full recovery or were observed with reduced severity at the end of the 60-90 day recovery period, \nindicating at least partial reversibility. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nGenotoxicity/Carcinogenicity \n \nOnpattro did not exhibit a genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo and was not carcinogenic in \ntransgenic rasH2 mice. \n \nReproductive toxicity \n \nIn rats, while there were parental decreases in serum TTR (≥ 90%), thyroxine (≥ 66%) and vitamin A \n(≥ 75%) levels using a rat specific surrogate to patisiran, no effects were found on male or female \nfertility, embryo-foetal development, or pre-/post-natal development. \n \nIn rabbits, Onpattro generated spontaneous abortions, reduced embryo-foetal survival, and reduced \nfoetal body weights at maternally toxic doses ≥ 1 mg/kg (HED 3.2 times the RHD). As patisiran is not \npharmacologically active in rabbits, these effects are not due to reductions in TTR, thyroxine or \nvitamin A. \n \nIntravenous administration of Onpattro had no effect on male reproductive assessments in sexually \nmature cynomolgus monkeys. \n \nIn lactating rats, patisiran was not present in milk, although small amounts of the lipid components \nDLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG were present in milk (up to 7% of concomitant maternal \nplasma concentrations). There were no adverse effects on the pups. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nOnpattro 2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \npatisiran \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Onpattro is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Onpattro \n3. How Onpattro is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Onpattro \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Onpattro is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in Onpattro is patisiran. \n \nOnpattro is a medicine that treats an illness which runs in families called hereditary ATTR (hATTR) \namyloidosis. \n \nhATTR amyloidosis is caused by problems with a protein in the body called ‘transthyretin’ (TTR). \n• This protein is made mostly in the liver and carries vitamin A and other substances around the \n\nbody. \n• In people with this illness, abnormally shaped TTR proteins clump together to make deposits \n\ncalled ‘amyloid’. \n• Amyloid can build up around the nerves, heart, and other places in the body, preventing them \n\nfrom working normally. This causes the symptoms of the illness. \n \nOnpattro works by lowering the amount of TTR protein that the liver makes. \n• This means there is less TTR protein in the blood that can form amyloid. \n• This can help to reduce the effects of this illness. \n \nOnpattro is used in adults only. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Onpattro \n \nYou must not be given Onpattro \n• if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to patisiran, or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given \nOnpattro. \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \n \nOnpattro is given as a drip into a vein (called an ‘intravenous infusion’). Reactions to this infusion \nmay happen during treatment with Onpattro. Before each infusion you will be given medicines that \nhelp to lower the chance of infusion-related reactions (see “Medicines given during treatment with \nOnpattro” in section 3). \n \nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any signs of an infusion-related reaction. These signs \nare listed at the beginning of section 4. \n \nIf you have an infusion-related reaction, your doctor or nurse may slow down or stop your infusion, \nand you may need to take other medicines to control the symptoms. When these reactions stop, or get \nbetter, your doctor or nurse may decide to start the infusion again. \n\n \nVitamin A deficiency \n \nTreatment with Onpattro lowers the amount of vitamin A in your blood. Your doctor will measure \nyour vitamin A levels, and if they are too low they should have returned to normal and any symptoms \ndue to vitamin A deficiency should have resolved before you start treatment with Onpattro. Symptoms \nof vitamin A deficiency may include: \n• Decrease in night vision, dry eyes, poor vision, hazy or cloudy vision \n\n \nIf you have problems with your vision or any other eye problems whilst using Onpattro, you should \ntalk to your doctor. Your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist for a check-up if it is necessary. \n \nYour doctor will ask you to take a daily vitamin A supplement during treatment with Onpattro. \n \nBoth too high and too low levels of vitamin A can harm the development of your unborn child. \nTherefore, women of child-bearing age should not be pregnant when starting treatment with Onpattro \nand should practice effective contraception (see section “Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception” \nbelow). \n \nTell your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking \nOnpattro. Your doctor will ensure that your vitamin A levels have returned to normal before you try to \nbecome pregnant. \n \nTell your doctor if you have an unplanned pregnancy. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking \nOnpattro. During the first 3 months of your pregnancy, your doctor may tell you to stop your vitamin \nA supplement. During the last 6 months of your pregnancy you should resume vitamin A \nsupplementation if the vitamin A levels in your blood have not yet returned to normal, because of an \nincreased risk of vitamin A deficiency during the last 3 months of your pregnancy. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nOnpattro is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Onpattro \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is \nimportant to tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines as your doctor \nmay need to change the dose: \n• Bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression or to help you to stop smoking \n• Efavirenz, a medicine used to treat HIV infection and AIDS \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before starting this medicine. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nWomen of child-bearing age \n \nOnpattro will reduce the level of vitamin A in your blood, which is important for normal development \nof your unborn child. If you are a woman of child-bearing age, you should practice effective \ncontraception during treatment with Onpattro. Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of \ncontraception. Pregnancy should be excluded before starting treatment with Onpattro. \n \nPregnancy \n \nYou should not use Onpattro if you are pregnant, unless advised by your doctor. If you are of child-\nbearing age and intend to use Onpattro, you should practise effective contraception. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIngredients of Onpattro may pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about stopping breast-feeding \nor treatment with Onpattro. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOnpattro is believed to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Your \ndoctor will tell you whether your condition allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. \n \nOnpattro contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 3.99 milligrams (mg) of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per \nmillilitre (mL). This is 0.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an \nadult. \n \n \n3. How Onpattro is given \n \nHow much Onpattro is given \n• Your doctor will work out how much Onpattro to give you – this will depend on your body weight. \n• The usual dose of Onpattro is 300 micrograms per kilogram (kg) of body weight given once every \n\n3 weeks. \n \nHow Onpattro is given \n• Onpattro will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. \n• It is given as a drip into a vein (‘intravenous infusion’) usually over about 80 minutes. \n \nIf you do not have problems with your infusions in the clinic, your doctor may talk with you about a \nhealthcare professional giving you your infusions at home. \n \nMedicines given during treatment with Onpattro \nBefore each infusion of Onpattro, you will be given medicines that help to lower the risk of infusion-\nrelated reactions. These include anti-histamines, a corticosteroid (a medicine that suppresses \ninflammation), and a pain reliever. \n \nHow long to use Onpattro \nYour doctor will tell you how long you need to receive Onpattro. Do not stop treatment with Onpattro \nunless your doctor tells you to. \n \nIf you are given more Onpattro than you should receive \nThis medicine will be given to you by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given \ntoo much (an overdose) your doctor or nurse will check you for side effects. \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nIf you miss your dose of Onpattro \nIf you miss an appointment to have Onpattro, ask your doctor or nurse when to book your next \ntreatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions are very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). \n \nTell your doctor or nurse straight away if you get any of the following signs of an infusion-related \nreaction during treatment. The infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped, and you may need to \ntake other medicines to manage the reaction. \n• Stomach pain \n• Feeling sick (nausea) \n• Body aches or pain, including pain in the back, neck, or joints \n• Headache \n• Feeling tired (fatigue) \n• Chills \n• Dizziness \n• Cough, feeling short of breath, or other breathing problems \n• Reddening of the face or body (flushing), warm skin, or rash \n• Chest discomfort or chest pain \n• Rapid heart rate \n• Low or high blood pressure; some patients have fainted during the infusion due to low blood \n\npressure \n• Pain, redness, burning sensation, or swelling at or near the infusion site \n• Swelling of the face \n \n \nOther side effects \nTell your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n• Swelling of the arms or legs (peripheral oedema) \n \nCommon: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n• Pain in the joints (arthralgia) \n• Muscle spasms \n• Indigestion (dyspepsia) \n• Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) \n• Redness of the skin (erythema) \n• Feeling dizzy or faint (vertigo) \n• Stuffy or runny nose (rhinitis) \n• Irritation or infection of the airways (sinusitis, bronchitis) \n \nUncommon: may occur in up to 1 in 100 infusions \n• Leakage of the drug into the surrounding tissue at the site of infusion, which may cause swelling \n\nor redness \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the side effects listed above. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

Each of the following medicinal products should be given on the \nday of Onpattro infusion at least 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion: \n• Intravenous corticosteroid (dexamethasone 10 mg, or equivalent) \n• Oral paracetamol (500 mg) \n• Intravenous H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg, or equivalent) \n• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, or equivalent) \n \nFor premedications not available or not tolerated intravenously, equivalents may be administered \norally. \n \nIf clinically indicated, the corticosteroid may be tapered in decrements no greater than 2.5 mg to a \nminimum dose of 5 mg of dexamethasone (intravenous, IV), or equivalent. The patient should receive \nat least 3 consecutive infusions of Onpattro without experiencing IRRs before each reduction in \ncorticosteroid premedication. \n \nAdditional or higher doses of one or more of the premedications may be administered to reduce the \nrisk of IRRs, if needed. \n \nPreparation of the solution for infusion \n \nThis medicinal product is for single-use only. \n \nOnpattro must be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution prior to intravenous infusion. \nThe diluted solution for infusion should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic \ntechnique as follows: \n• Remove Onpattro from the refrigerator. Do not shake or vortex. \n• Discard vial if it has been frozen. \n• Inspect visually for particulate matter and discolouration. Do not use if discolouration or foreign \n\nparticles are present. Onpattro is a white to off-white, opalescent, homogeneous solution. A \nwhite to off-white coating may be observed on the inner surface of the vial, typically at the \nliquid-headspace interface. Product quality is not impacted by presence of the white to off-white \ncoating. \n\n• Calculate the required volume of Onpattro based on the recommended weight-based dosage. \n• Withdraw the entire contents of one or more vials into a single sterile syringe. \n• Filter Onpattro through a sterile 0.45 micron polyethersulfone (PES) syringe filter into a sterile \n\ncontainer. \n• Withdraw the required volume of filtered Onpattro from the sterile container using a sterile \n\nsyringe. \n• Dilute the required volume of filtered Onpattro into an infusion bag containing sodium chloride \n\n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for a total volume of 200 mL. Use infusion bags that are free of di(2-\nethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). \n\n\n\n32 \n\n• Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake. Do not mix or dilute with other \nmedicinal products. \n\n• Discard any unused portion of Onpattro. Any unused medicinal product or waste material \nshould be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n• Onpattro does not contain preservatives. The diluted solution should be administered \nimmediately after preparation. If not used immediately, store the diluted solution in the infusion \nbag at room temperature (up to 30°C) or at 2°C to 8°C for up to 16 hours (including infusion \ntime). Do not freeze. \n\n \nAdministration \n \nOnpattro is for intravenous use. \n• Onpattro must be diluted prior to intravenous infusion. \n• A dedicated line with an infusion set containing a 1.2 micron PES in-line infusion filter must be \n\nused. The infusion sets must be free of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). \n• The diluted solution of Onpattro should be infused intravenously over approximately \n\n80 minutes at an initial infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/min for the first 15 minutes, \nfollowed by an increase to approximately 3 mL/min for the remainder of the infusion. The \nduration of infusion may be extended in the event of an IRR. \n\n• Onpattro must be administered through a secure and free-flowing venous access line. The \ninfusion site should be monitored for possible infiltration during administration. Suspected \nextravasation should be managed according to local standard practice for non-vesicants. \n\n• The patient should be observed during the infusion and, if clinically indicated, following the \ninfusion. \n\n• After completion of the infusion, the intravenous administration set should be flushed with \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution to ensure that all medicinal product has been \nadministered. \n\n  \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
