This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nHulio 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach 0.8 ml single dose vial contains 40 mg of adalimumab. \n \nAdalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nEach vial contains 38.2 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection). \n \nClear or slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brownish-yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHulio in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Hulio can be given as monotherapy in case \nof intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for \nthe efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less \nthan 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \ntherapy and phototherapies. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne \ninversa) in adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS \ntherapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from \n2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in \nwhom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHulio treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Hulio is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to \nconsult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Hulio (see section 4.4). \nPatients treated with Hulio should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Hulio if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nDuring treatment with Hulio, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from \n2 years, of age is based on body weight (Table 1). Hulio is administered every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection. \n \nTable 1: Hulio Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time \nperiod. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 2). Hulio is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 2: Hulio Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis \n\n \n  Patient Weight  Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n\n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Hulio dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Hulio is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 3: Hulio Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis \n\n \n  Patient Weight  Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg \ngiven every other week starting one week \n\nafter the initial dose \n\n\u2265 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg \ngiven every other week starting one week \n\nafter the initial dose \n \n\nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nIf retreatment with Hulio is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.  \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS.  \n \nThe posology of adalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling \nand simulation (see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Hulio dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at \nweek 1 via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Hulio 40 mg every other week, an increase in \ndosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Hulio if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHulio. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Hulio may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data \nin section 5.1). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Hulio is administered via subcutaneous injection.   \n \nTable 4: Hulio Dose for Paediatric Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease \n\n \nPatient \nWeight \n\nInduction Dose Maintenance \nDose \n\nStarting at \nweek 4 \n\n< 40 kg \u2022 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use \nof the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n\u2265 40 kg \u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use \nof the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 \n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n\u2022 < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n\u2022 \u2265 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n\n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this indication. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based on body \nweight (Table 5). Hulio is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with Hulio without concomitant treatment \nwith methotrexate. \n \nTable 5: Hulio Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n\n \n  Patient Weight  Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n \nWhen Hulio therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients \u2265 30 kg may \nbe administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are available on the use of \na Hulio loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication.  \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.  \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHulio is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nA 40 mg pen and a 40 mg prefilled syringe are also available for patients to administer a full 40 mg \ndose.   \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Hulio. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period. \n \nTreatment with Hulio should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis \nand patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Hulio \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Hulio, should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Hulio should be discontinued \nif a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal \ntherapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when \nconsidering the use of Hulio in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying \nconditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \ntuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Hulio, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Hulio therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Hulio, and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Hulio \nin patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed.  \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \nafter therapy with Hulio.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-\nantagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \noutcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Hulio should be \npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \nfungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Hulio. For \npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Hulio should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Hulio should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \nof Hulio in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Hulio should be considered if any of these disorders \ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \nuveitis prior to the initiation of Hulio therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre-existing \nor developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nHulio should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or \n6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Hulio cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Hulio. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Hulio. Discontinuation of Hulio therapy \nshould be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \nfor 5 months following the mother's last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Hulio should be used with caution in \npatients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Hulio is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart \nfailure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Hulio must be discontinued in patients who develop new or \nworsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Hulio may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient \ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Hulio and is \npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Hulio should not be given \n(see section 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-\nantagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \n\n\n\n11 \n\ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See \nsection 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \npatient who requires surgery while on Hulio should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) \nshould not take/be given this medicinal product. \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Hulio and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d).  \n \nThe combination of Hulio and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Hulio treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 \n(8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA \n(unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with \nCD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The \nadjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for \nthe secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and \nserious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation \nof data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size \nand non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not \navailable (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\uf061, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded.  \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast feeding \n \n Limited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \nConsequently, adalimumab can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHulio may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Hulio (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long \nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-\nrelated arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \nperiod. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \ntreated patients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defence against infection and cancer. \n \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events \nand reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on \npostmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest \nfrequency seen among the various indications has been included.

adalimumab. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared \nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.  \n \nInfections \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.  \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and \n0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control - treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in \n192 paediatric patients with an exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric \npatients with Crohn's disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 80.0 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque \n\n\n\n19 \n\npsoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient \nyears during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per \n1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients \nand 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell \ncarcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The rate \n(95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I \u2212 V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \nactive control \u2212 treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported \npositive titres at week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid \narthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like \nsyndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus \nnephritis or central nervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x \nULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT \nelevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the \nPhase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were \n2 to <4 years. \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with a \ncontrol period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients. \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations \u22653 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed \nby 40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control \nperiod duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 \ndays and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \n\u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, \nsuch as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn's disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone. \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended \ndose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21 \n\n \nHulio is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab \ntreated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended \noligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel-group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-\ntreated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from \nMTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of \nNSAIDs and or prednisone (\u2264 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients \nreceived 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The \ndistribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI \nphase is presented in Table 7. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n22 \n\nTable 7: Distribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI \nphase \n\n \nAge Group  Number of patients at \n\nBaseline n (%)  \nMinimum, median and \nmaximum dose  \n\n4 to 7 years  31 (18.1)  10, 20 and 25 mg  \n8 to 12 years  71 (41.5)  20, 25 and 40 mg  \n13 to 17 years  69 (40.4)  25, 40 and 40 mg  \n \nPatients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into \nthe double blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, \nor placebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria \nwere defined as a worsening of \u2265 30% from baseline in \u2265 3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u2265 2 active \njoints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease \nflare, patients were eligible to enrol into the open label extension phase. \n \nTable 8: Ped ACR 30 Responses in the JIA study \n \nStratum  MTX Without MTX \nPhase    \nOL-LI 16 weeks    \n\nPed ACR 30 response \n(n/N)  \n\n94.1% (80/85) 74.4% (64/86) \n\nEfficacy Outcomes \nDouble Blind 32 weeks  Adalimumab /MTX  \n\n(N = 38)  \nPlacebo / MTX  \n(N = 37)  \n\nAdalimumab  \n(N = 30)  \n\nPlacebo  \n(N = 28)  \n\nDisease flares at the \nend of 32 weeksa \n(n/N)  \n\n36.8% (14/38)  64.9% (24/37)b 43.3% (13/30)  71.4% (20/28)c \n\nMedian time to \ndisease flare  \n\n>32 weeks  20 weeks  >32 weeks  14 weeks  \n\na Ped ACR 30/50/70 responses week 48 significantly greater than those of placebo treated patients  \nb p = 0.015 \nc p = 0.031 \n \nAmongst those who responded at week 16 (n=144), the Pediatric ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were \nmaintained for up to six years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the \nstudy. Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with \nthe combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \nNSAIDs. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nAt week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Pediatric \nACR 30) at week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Pediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period. \nOverall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study \nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-\nlabel (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was \nthe percent change from Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not \ndue to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with \nmean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the adalimumab \ngroup compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. \nImprovement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through \nweek 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. \nAlthough not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in \nsecondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count \n(SJC), Pediatric ACR 50 response, and Pediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo \non alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same \nduration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \nweek up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\nrheumatic drug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \n\n\n\n24 \n\nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first \n104 weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \nadministered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and \nV had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by \nX-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \nTable 9. \n \nTable 9: ACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Percent of Patients) \n \nResponse  RA Study Ia** \n\n \nRA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n\n Placebo\n/ MTXc \n\nn=60 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nn=63 \n\nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nAdalimumabb \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo\n/ MTXc \nn=200 \n\nAdalimumabb\n/ MTXc \nn=207 \n\nACR 20        \n6 months  13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3% \n12 months  NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9% \nACR  50        \n6 months  6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1% \n12 months  NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5% \nACR  70        \n6 months  3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8% \n12 months  NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2% \na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks , and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, adalimumab versus placebo \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and \nswollen joints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) \nscores and CRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, \nthese improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; \nand 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab \n40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; \n56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).  \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and \n50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate na\u00efve, combination \ntherapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see Table 10). \n \nTable 10: ACR Responses in RA Study V (percent of patients) \n \nResponse MTX \n\nn=257 \nAdalimumab \n\nn=274 \nAdalimumab /MTX \n\nn=268 \np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20        \nWeek 52  62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \nWeek 104  56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \n\nACR  50        \nWeek 52  45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \nWeek 104  42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \n\nACR  70        \nWeek 52  27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \nWeek 104  28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \n\na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test.  \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for \nup to 10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, \n170 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, \n154 patients (90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and \n102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nAt week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and \nadalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently \ndiagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was \nsimilar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, \n171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were \nreported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space \nnarrowing score. Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 11).  \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage \nis maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients \nshowed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or \nless. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were \nevaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage \ndefined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \nTable 11:  Radiographic Mean Changes Over 12 Months in RA Study III \n \n Placebo/ MTXa Adalimumab /MTX \n\n40 mg every other \nweek \n\nPlacebo/MTX- \nAdalimumab \n/MTX (95% \nConfidence \nIntervalb) \n\np-value \n\nTotal Sharp Score  2.7 0.1 2.6 (1.4, 3.8) < 0.001c \nErosion score  1.6 0.0 1.6 (0.9, 2.2) < 0.001 \nJSNd score  1.0 0.1 0.9 (0.3, 1.4) 0.002 \na methotrexate \nb 95% confidence intervals for the differences in change scores between methotrexate and \nadalimumab.  \nc Based on rank analysis  \nd Joint Space Narrowing \n \nIn RA study V, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in \nmodified Total Sharp Score (see Table 12). \n \nTable 12: Radiographic Mean Changes at week 52 in RA Study V \n \n MTX \n\nn=257 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nAdalimumab \nn=274 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\nAdalimumab \n/MTX \nn=268 \n(95% \n\nconfidence \ninterval) \n\np-\nvaluea \n\np-\nvalueb \n\np-\nvaluec \n\nTotal Sharp Score  5.7 (4.2-7.3) 3.0 (1.7-4.3) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) < 0.001 0.0020 < 0.001 \nErosion score  3.7 (2.7-4.7) 1.7 (1.0-2.4) 0.8 (0.4-1.2) < 0.001 0.0082 < 0.001 \nJSN score  2.0 (1.2-2.8) 1.3 (0.5-2.1) 0.5 (0-1.0) < 0.001 0.0037 0.151 \na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test.  \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \n\ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \n\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nFollowing 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression \n(change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score \u2264 0.5) was significantly higher with adalimumab \n/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to methotrexate \nmonotherapy (37.4% and 33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy (50.7%, \np < 0.002 and 44.5%, p < 0.001 respectively). \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at Year 10 in the modified \nTotal Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomised to methotrexate \nmonotherapy, adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy, \nrespectively. The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were \n31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability \nindex of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was \nseen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component \nsummary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the \n40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional \nassessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was \nassessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab /methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 \npaediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a \nPhysician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) \u2265 4 or > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement \nwith very thick lesions or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u2265 20 or \u2265 10 with clinically \nrelevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled with topical \ntherapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \nmethotrexate 0.1 \u2013 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At week 16, more patients randomised to \nadalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to \n0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX. \n \nTable 13:  Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 weeks \n  \n\nMTXa \nN=37 \n\nAdalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow \nN=38 \n\n PASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \n PGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \na MTX = methotrexate  \nb P=0.027, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX  \nc P=0.083, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \n \nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). \nPatients were then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response \nrates observed during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response \nof 78.9% (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained \nfor up to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nAdult plaque psoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis \n(\u2265 10% BSA involvement and PASI \u2265 12 or \u2265 10) who were candidates for systemic therapy or \nphototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients enrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and \nII had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were \nalso studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with concomitant hand \nand/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a randomised double-blind study \n(Psoriasis Study III).  \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \u2265PASI 75 \nresponse at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in period A, were re-randomised \nin period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. \nAcross all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline PGA score \nranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53% of subjects included) to \u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus \nmethotrexate and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg \nand thereafter dose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of \n80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for \n16 weeks. There are no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. \nPatients receiving MTX who achieved a \u2265PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive \nfurther dose increases. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the \nbaseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmild\u201d (<1%) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48%) to \u201csevere\u201d (46%) to \u201cvery \nsevere\u201d (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-\nlabel extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a \nPASI 75 response from baseline at week 16 (see Tables 14 and 15). \n \nTable 14: Ps Study I (REVEAL) - Efficacy Results at 16 weeks \n\n \n  Placebo \n\nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \nPGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-adjusted rate  \nb p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nTable 15: Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 weeks \n \n  Placebo \n\nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \nPGA: Clear/minimal 6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \na p<0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo  \nb p<0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate  \nc p<0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo  \nd p<0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate  \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to \nplacebo at week 33 compared to 5% continuing on adalimumab, p<0.001, experienced \u201closs of \nadequate response\u201d (PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 \nresponse relative to baseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33). \nOf the patients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into \nthe open-label extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and \n24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI \n75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, \nafter an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all \npatients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, \nwere considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these \npatients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy \n(total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-\nlabel extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a \nmedian time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of \nthese patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after \n16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] \nand 88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, \nimprovements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also \nsignificant compared to placebo. \n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \nachieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in \n72 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands \nand/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \n\n\n\n30 \n\nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 16). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA\u226510% (60% of patients) and BSA<10% and \u22655% (40% of patients)). \n \nTable 16:  Ps Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 weeks \n \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled \n\nWeek 26 \nPlacebo-Controlled \n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nAdalimumab  \n40 mg eow \nN=80 \n\n\u2265 mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear/minimal and \n\u22652-grade improvement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in Total \nFingernail NAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n\n \nAdalimumab treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at week 26 compared with \nplacebo in the DLQI. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab \nfor the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure \nlevels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on \ncross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more \nfrequent doses (see section 5.2). \n \nAdult hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies and an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis \nsuppurativa (HS) who were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-\nmonth trial of systemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg \nevery week starting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in period A were re-\nrandomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to \nplacebo in period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and \n40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral \nantibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab \nin period A were re-randomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every \n\n\n\n31 \n\nweek, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had \nbeen randomised to placebo in period A were assigned to receive placebo in period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension \nstudy in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab \npopulation was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 \npoint scale.  \n \nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo \nachieved HiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced \na clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 17). Patients treated with adalimumab \nhad significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nTable 17:  Efficacy Results at 12 weeks, HS Studies I and II \n\n  \nHS Study I HS Study II \n\nPlacebo Adalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nPlacebo Adalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa \nClinical Response (HiSCR)a \n\nN = 154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN = 153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n\u226530% Reduction in Skin \nPainb \n\nN = 109 \n27 (24.8%) \n\nN = 122 \n34 (27.9%) \n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) *** \n\n* P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, adalimumab versus placebo  \na Among all randomised patients.  \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment \u2265 3, based on Numeric Rating Scale 0 \u2013 \n\n10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine.  \n \nTreatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of \nabscesses and draining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in \nthe first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group \nexperienced worsening of abscesses (23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs \n13.9%, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-\nspecific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; \nStudies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the \nTreatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical \nhealth as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR rate at \nweek 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing \nfrequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 18). \n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTable 18:  Proportion of Patientsa Achieving HiSCRb at weeks 24 and 36 After Treatment \nReassignment from weekly Adalimumab at week 12 \n\n  \nPlacebo \n\n(treatment withdrawal) \nN = 73 \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week \n\nN = 70 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nN = 70 \nWeek 24  24 (32.9%) 36 (51.4%) 40 (57.1%) \nWeek 36  22 (30.1%) 28 (40.0%) 39 (55.7%) \na Patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly after 12 weeks of treatment.  \nb Patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no improvement were required to \n\ndiscontinue from the studies and were counted as nonresponders.  \n \nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at week 12, and who received continuous weekly \nadalimumab therapy, the HiSCR rate at week 48 was 68.3% and at week 96 was 65.1%. Longer term \ntreatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, \nthe HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar \nto that observed before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body \nweight (< 40 kg or \u2265 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, \nwith moderate to severe Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index \n(PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid \nand/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been \nintolerant to infliximab.  \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: \n160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects \u2265 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for \nsubjects < 40 kg. \n \nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low \nDose or Standard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 19. \n \nTable 19: Maintenance regimen \n \n\nPatient Weight Low dose Standard dose \n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow \n\u2265 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow \n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 26, defined as PCDAI score \u2264 10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points \nfrom Baseline) rates are presented in Table 20.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in \nthe study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI. \n \nAdult Crohn's disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these medications.  \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at \nweek 2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were \nrandomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at \nweeks 0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these \npatients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD Study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, \n854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u2265 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed \nseparately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted \nafter week 8. \n \nCD Study I and CD Study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 22. \n \nTable 22: Induction of Clinical Remission and Response (Percent of Patients) \n \n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive Patients CD Study II: Infliximab \n\nExperienced Patients \n Placebo \n\nN=74 \nAdalimumab \n\n80/40 mg \nN = 75 \n\nAdalimumab \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nAdalimumab \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \nWeek 4       \nClinical remission  12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \nClinical response \n(CR-100)  \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for adalimumab versus placebo  \n* p < 0.001  \n** p < 0.01  \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \nIn CD Study III, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in \nthe primary analysis. Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to \nother TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 23. \nClinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist \nexposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at week 56. \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nTable 23: Maintenance of Clinical Remission and Response (Percent of Patients) \n  \n\nPlacebo 40 mg \nAdalimumab \n\nevery other week \n\n40 mg \nAdalimumab \nevery week \n\nWeek 26 N=170 N=172 N=157 \nClinical remission  17% 40%* 47%* \nClinical response (CR-100)  27% 52%* 52%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n3% (2/66) 19% (11/58)** 15% (11/74)** \n\nWeek 56 N=170 N=172 N=157 \nClinical remission  12% 36%* 41%* \nClinical response (CR-100)  17% 41%* 48%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n5% (3/66) 29% (17/58)* 20% (15/74)** \n\n*      p < 0.001 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions  \n**    p < 0.02 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions  \na          Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline  \n \nAmong patients who were not in response at week 4, 43% of adalimumab maintenance patients \nresponded by week 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through \nweek 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed \nthrough at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, \ncontinued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and \n233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 \nand 56 in CD Study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo \ngroup. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled \nstudy of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious \nanterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received \neither placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week \nin combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time.  \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nClinical Response  \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 1, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]).  \n \nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric \n\nUveitis Study \n \n\n \nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \nAdult Uveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15.  \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical Response  \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 24). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see Figure 2).  \n \nTable 24: Time to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n \nAnalysis \n Treatment \n\nN Failure N \n(%) \n\nMedian Time to \nFailure (months) \n\nHRa CI 95% \nfor HRa \n\nP Value b \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After week 6 in Study UV I \nPrimary analysis (ITT)       \n Placebo 107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70 < 0.001 \nTime to Treatment Failure At or After week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT)       \n Placebo 111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \n Adalimumab 115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \nNote: Treatment failure at or after week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after week 2 (Study UV II), was \ncounted as event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab.  \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60  \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364  remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no \nactive inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose \n\u2264 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or \nmaintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were \ngenerally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. \nOverall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and \n8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nQuality of Life  \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in Study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in Study UV II. \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand the occurrence of adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 \n\u00b1 5.6 \u03bcg/ml (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/ml \n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 \u00b1 \n5.6 \u03bcg/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/ml for adalimumab \nwithout concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcg/ml (79% CV). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since \nexposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and \ninadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \nAt week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \n\n\n\n40 \n\nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/ml for patients \u2265 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcg/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5 \u00b1 5.6 \u03bcg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcg/ml for \nthe Low Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (\u00b1SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3 \u00b1 11.4 \u03bcg/ml \n(40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 \u00b1 3.5 \u03bcg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was 3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nAdults  \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately \n5 \u03bcg/ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u03bcg/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), \nrespectively. The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally \nwith dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u03bcg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 \u03bcg/ml at \nweek 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. \n \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 \u03bcg/ml \n\n\n\n41 \n\nduring the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u03bcg/ml were observed \nin Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/ml.  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be \nlower in patients with measurable AAA.  \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising \nantibodies in rodents. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nHulio in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n \n\u2022 the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate. \n\n\u2022 the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate. \n\n \nHulio can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment \nwith methotrexate is inappropriate. \n \nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \nand to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nHulio in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile \nidiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or \nmore disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Hulio can be given as monotherapy in case \nof intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for \nthe efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less \nthan 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and \nolder, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had \nan inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, who have had \nan inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Adalimumab \nhas been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in \npatients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see Section 5.1) and to improve \nphysical function. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients \nwho are candidates for systemic therapy. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \ntherapy and phototherapies. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne \ninversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional \nsystemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nHulio is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients \nwho have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nHulio is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and \n6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid \nsparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nHulio is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHulio treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Hulio is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised to \nconsult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Hulio (see section 4.4). \nPatients treated with Hulio should be given the Patient Reminder Card. \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Hulio if their physician \ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n \nDuring treatment with Hulio, other concomitant therapies (e.g., corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \ncontinued during treatment with Hulio. \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with Hulio. Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Hulio 40 mg every other \nweek may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other \nweek. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nDose interruption \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n \nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer \nresulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose \ninterruption. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic \narthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with ankylosing spondylitis axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Hulio 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of \ncontinued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a \npatient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response \nis achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be \nreduced to 40 mg every other week. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe recommended Hulio dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 160 mg \ninitially at Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two \nconsecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at Day 15 (given as two 40 mg injections in one \nday). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n(given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with Hulio \nif necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS \nlesions on a daily basis during treatment with Hulio. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Hulio 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be re-\nintroduced (see section 5.1). \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease \n \nThe recommended Hulio induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely active \nCrohn\u2019s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a more \nrapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or \nas two injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in \none day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during induction. \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Hulio and signs and symptoms of disease recur, Hulio \nmay be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 weeks since \nthe previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Hulio 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Hulio every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nThe recommended Hulio induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative \ncolitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per \nday for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). After \ninduction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Hulio 40 mg every other week may benefit \nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg Hulio every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. Hulio \ntherapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by \n40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited experience in \nthe initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with Hulio can be initiated in \ncombination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory agents. \nConcomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two weeks \nafter initiating treatment with Hulio. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required.  \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, aged from \n2 years of age is based on body weight (Table 1). Hulio is administered every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 1: Hulio Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \n\nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time \nperiod. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of age is \nbased on body weight (Table 2). Hulio is administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nTable 2: Hulio Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis \n \n\n  Patient Weight  Dosing Regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n \n\n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe recommended Hulio dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 3). Hulio is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 3: Hulio Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis \n\n \n  Patient Weight  Dosing Regimen \n\n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg \ngiven every other week starting one week \n\nafter the initial dose \n\n\u2265 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg \ngiven every other week starting one week \n\nafter the initial dose \n \n\n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nIf retreatment with Hulio is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration should be \nfollowed. \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months. \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.  \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of \nadalimumab in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nThe recommended Hulio dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at week \n1 via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to Hulio 40 mg every other week, an increase in dosage \nto 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \n\n\n\n50 \n\nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with Hulio if necessary. It is recommended that the \npatient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with \nHulio. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no improvement \nwithin this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, Hulio may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data \nin section 5.1) \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is based on \nbody weight (Table 4). Hulio is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 4: Hulio Dose for Paediatric Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease \n\n \nPatient \nWeight \n\nInduction Dose Maintenance \nDose \n\nStarting at \nweek 4 \n\n< 40 kg \u2022 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use \nof the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n\u2265 40 kg \u2022 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use \nof the higher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\u2022 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 \n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n\u2022 < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n\u2022 \u2265 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. \n\n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this indication. \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of Hulio for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is based on body \nweight (Table 5). Hulio is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with Hulio without concomitant treatment \nwith methotrexate. \n \nTable 5: Hulio Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n\n \n  Patient Weight  Dosing Regimen \n\n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week in \ncombination with methotrexate \n\n \nWhen Hulio therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for patients \u2265 30 kg may \nbe administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical data are available on the use of \na Hulio loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see section 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 2 years in this indication.  \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nHulio may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children aged 4-17 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. There is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this \nindication. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nHulio is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the package \nleaflet. \n \nA 40 mg paediatric vial is available for patients who need to administer less than the full 40 mg dose.   \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \nInfections \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Hulio. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period. \n \nTreatment with Hulio should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis \nand patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with Hulio \nshould be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Hulio, should be monitored \nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Hulio should be discontinued \nif a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or antifungal \ntherapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise caution when \nconsidering the use of Hulio in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying \nconditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \nimmunosuppressive medications. \n \nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \ntuberculosis.  \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with Hulio, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Hulio therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered. \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Hulio, and in accordance with local recommendations.  \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Hulio \nin patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed.  \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \nafter therapy with Hulio.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-\nantagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \noutcomes.  \n \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Hulio should be \npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \nfungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Hulio. For \npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Hulio should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, Hulio should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \nof Hulio in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Hulio should be considered if any of these disorders \ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \nuveitis prior to the initiation of Hulio therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre-existing \nor developing central demyelinating disorders.  \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\nAllergic reactions \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nHulio should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nImmunosuppression \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or \n6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Hulio cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering adalimumab treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Hulio. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \n \n\n\n\n55 \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. \n \nHaematologic reactions \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Hulio. Discontinuation of Hulio therapy \nshould be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n \nVaccinations \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n \nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \nfor 5 months following the mother's last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Hulio should be used with caution in \npatients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Hulio is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart \nfailure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Hulio must be discontinued in patients who develop new or \nworsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n \nAutoimmune processes \n \nTreatment with Hulio may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient \ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Hulio and is \npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Hulio should not be given \n(see section 4.8). \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-\nantagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n \nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \n\n\n\n56 \n\ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See \nsection 4.5). \n \nSurgery \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \npatient who requires surgery while on Hulio should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.  \n \nSmall bowel obstruction \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn's disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures. \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nSorbitol \nThis medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) \nshould not take/be given this medicinal product. \n \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of Hulio and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d).  \n \nThe combination of Hulio and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child bearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Hulio treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large number (approximately 2,100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1,500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 \n(8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA \n(unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with \nCD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The \nadjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for \nthe secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and \nserious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation \nof data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size \nand non-randomized design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not \navailable (see section 5.3). \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\uf061, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n \nBreast feeding \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \nConsequently, adalimumab can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHulio may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of Hulio (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long \nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-\nrelated arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \nperiod. \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \ntreated patients. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body's defence against infection and cancer. \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab. \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events \nand reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on \npostmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: \nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest \nfrequency seen among the various indications has been included.

profile of adalimumab. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab.  \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared \nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product.  \n \nInfections \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.  \n \nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and \n0.03 per patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in \n192 paediatric patients with an exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric \npatients with Crohn's disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an \nexposure of 80.0 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque \n\n\n\n64 \n\npsoriasis. No malignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient \nyears during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per \n1,000 patient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients \nand 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell \ncarcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The rate \n(95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over \n26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years. \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4). \n \nAutoantibodies \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I \u2212 V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \nactive control \u2212 treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported \npositive titres at week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid \narthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like \nsyndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus \nnephritis or central nervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x \nULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT \nelevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the \nPhase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to \n<4 years. \n \n\n\n\n65 \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with a \ncontrol period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients. \n \nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n \nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque Psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations \u22653 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed \nby 40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control \nperiod duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of \n166.5 days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT \nelevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated \npatients.  \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, \nsuch as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n \nIn adult Crohn's disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone. \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended \ndose. \n \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n66 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04 \n \nHulio is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab \ntreated patients. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo \non alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same \nduration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n67 \n\nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \nweek up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\nrheumatic drug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first \n104 w e e k s , 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of \nadalimumab was administered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and \nV had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by \nX-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \nTable 7. \n \nTable 7: ACR Responses in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Percent of Patients) \n \nResponse  RA Study Ia** \n\n \nRA Study IIa** RA Study IIIa** \n\n Placebo\n/ MTXc \n\nn=60 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nn=63 \n\nPlacebo \nn=110 \n\nAdalimumabb \nn=113 \n\nPlacebo\n/ MTXc \nn=200 \n\nAdalimumabb/ \nMTXc \nn=207 \n\nACR 20        \n  6 months  13.3% 65.1% 19.1% 46.0% 29.5% 63.3% \n12 months  NA NA NA NA 24.0% 58.9% \nACR  50        \n  6 months  6.7% 52.4% 8.2% 22.1% 9.5% 39.1% \n12 months  NA NA NA NA 9.5% 41.5% \nACR  70        \n  6 months  3.3% 23.8% 1.8% 12.4% 2.5% 20.8% \n12 months  NA NA NA NA 4.5% 23.2% \na RA study I at 24 weeks, RA study II at 26 weeks , and RA study III at 24 and 52 weeks \nb 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week \nc MTX = methotrexate \n**p < 0.01, adalimumab versus placebo \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\nIn RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and \nswollen joints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) \nscores and CRP (mg/dl) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, \nthese improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; \nand 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab \n40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; \n56 patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).  \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and \n50 responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate na\u00efve, combination \ntherapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see Table 8). \n \nTable 8: ACR Responses in RA Study V (percent of patients) \n \nResponse MTX \n\nn=257 \nAdalimumab \n\nn=274 \nAdalimumab \n\n/MTX \nn=268 \n\np-valuea p-valueb p-valuec \n\nACR 20        \nWeek 52  62.6% 54.4% 72.8% 0.013 < 0.001 0.043 \nWeek 104  56.0% 49.3% 69.4% 0.002 < 0.001 0.140 \nACR  50        \nWeek 52  45.9% 41.2% 61.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.317 \nWeek 104  42.8% 36.9% 59.0% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.162 \nACR  70        \nWeek 52  27.2% 25.9% 45.5% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.656 \nWeek 104  28.4% 28.1% 46.6% < 0.001 < 0.001 0.864 \na p-value is from the pairwise comparison of methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test.  \nb p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy using the Mann-Whitney U test  \nc p-value is from the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy \nusing the Mann-Whitney U test \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for \nup to 10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, \n170 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, \n154 patients (90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and \n102 patients (60.0%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nAt week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and \nadalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently \ndiagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was \n\n\n\n69 \n\nsimilar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomized to adalimumab monotherapy or \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, \n171 subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were \nreported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space \nnarrowing score. adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 9).  \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA Study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage \nis maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically.

The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were \n31.3%, 23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability \nindex of the HAQ from baseline to Month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was \nseen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component \nsummary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the \n40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional \nassessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was \nassessed (RA studies I, III, IV). \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab /methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended \noligoarthritis). \n \npJIA I \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel-group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-\ntreated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from \nMTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of \nNSAIDs and or prednisone (\u2264 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients \nreceived 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The \n\n\n\n71 \n\ndistribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI \nphase is presented in Table 11. \n \nTable 11: Distribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI \n\nphase \n \n\nAge Group Number of patients at \nBaseline n (%) \n\nMinimum, median and \nmaximum dose \n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n\n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n \nPatients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into \nthe double blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, \nor placebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria \nwere defined as a worsening of \u2265 30% from baseline in \u2265 3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u2265 2 active \njoints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with \nthe combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \n\n\n\n72 \n\nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \nNSAIDs. \n \nAt week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Pediatric \nACR 30) at week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Pediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period. \nOverall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study \nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-\nlabel (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was \nthe percent change from Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not \ndue to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with \nmean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the adalimumab \ngroup compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. \nImprovement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through \nweek 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. \nAlthough not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in \nsecondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count \n(SJC), Pediatric ACR 50 response, and Pediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS)  \n \nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline \nscore of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in \nall groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) \npatients were treated concomitantly with disease modifying anti \u2212 rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) \npatients with glucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open \u2212 label period during \nwhich patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional \n28 weeks. Subjects (n=215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received \nearly escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently \ntreated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to \nplacebo.

A modified \nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS \nused for rheumatoid arthritis), was used. \n \nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with \nplacebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean \u00b1 SD) 0.8 \u00b1 2.5 in the placebo \ngroup (at week 24) compared with 0.0 \u00b1 1.9; (p< 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48). \n \nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 \n(n=102), 84% continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \nAdalimumab treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function \nas assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. \nImproved physical function continued during the open label extension up to week 136. \n \nPsoriasis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis \n(\u2265 10% BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u2265 12 or \u2265 10) who were \ncandidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients \nenrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety \nand efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque \npsoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a \nrandomised double-blind study (Psoriasis Study III).  \n \nPsoriasis Study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \u2265PASI 75 \nresponse at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in Period A, were re-\nrandomised in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional \n19 weeks. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline \nPhysician's Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53% of subjects included) to \n\u201csevere\u201d (41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n \nPsoriasis Study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus \nmethotrexate and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg \nand thereafter dose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of \n80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for \n16 weeks. There are no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. \nPatients receiving MTX who achieved a \u2265PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive \nfurther dose increases. Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the \nbaseline PGA score ranged from \u201cmild\u201d (<1%) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48%) to \u201csevere\u201d (46%) to \u201cvery \nsevere\u201d (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-\nlabel extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n \nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a \nPASI 75 response from baseline at week 16 (see Tables 17 and 18). \n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nTable 17: Ps Study I (REVEAL) - Efficacy Results at 16 weeks \n \n\n  Placebo \nN=398 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=814 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75a 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)b \nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)b \nPGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)b \na Percent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as centre-adjusted rate  \nb p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo  \n \nTable 18: Ps Study II (CHAMPION) Efficacy Results at 16 weeks \n \n  Placebo \n\nN=53 \nn (%) \n\nMTX \nN=110 \nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=108 \nn (%) \n\n\u2265 PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) a, b \nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) c, d \nPGA: Clear/minimal 6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) a, b \na p<0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo  \nb p<0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate  \nc p<0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo  \nd p<0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \n \nIn Psoriasis Study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to \nplacebo at week 33 compared to 5% continuing on adalimumab, p<0.001, experienced \u201closs of \nadequate response\u201d (PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 \nresponse relative to baseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33). \nOf the patients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into \nthe open-label extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and \n24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis Study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI \n75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, \nafter an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all \npatients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, \nwere considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these \npatients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy \n(total of 160 weeks). \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-\nlabel extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a \nmedian time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of \nthese patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after \n16 weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] \nand 88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n \nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n(Study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In Study I, \nimprovements in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also \nsignificant compared to placebo. \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \nachieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis Study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 72 \npatients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands \nand/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis Study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 19). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA\u226510% (60% of patients) and BSA<10% and \u22655% (40% of patients)). \n \nTable 19:  Ps Study IV Efficacy Results at 16, 26 and 52 weeks \n \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \nPlacebo-Controlled \n\n 26 Placebo-\nControlled \n\nWeek 52 \nOpen-label \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nPlacebo \nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg eow \n\nN=80 \n\u2265 mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \nPGA-F clear/minimal and \n\u22652-grade improvement (%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent Change in \nTotal Fingernail \nNAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n\nAdalimumab treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at week 26 compared with \nplacebo in the DLQI. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 \npaediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA \u2265 4 \nor > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI \u2265 20 or \u2265 10 \nwith clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled \nwith topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy.  \n \nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \nmethotrexate 0.1 \u2013 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At week 16, more patients randomised to \nadalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g., PASI 75) than those randomised to \n0.4 mg/kg eow or MTX. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nTable 20:  Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis Efficacy Results at 16 weeks \n  \n\nMTXa \nN=37 \n\nAdalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow \nN=38 \n\n PASI 75b 12 (32.4%) 22 (57.9%) \n PGA: Clear/minimalc 15 (40.5%) 23 (60.5%) \na MTX = methotrexate  \nb P=0.027, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX  \nc P=0.083, adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg versus MTX \n\n \nPatients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to \n36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). \nPatients were then re-treated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for an additional 16 weeks and response \nrates observed during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 75 response \nof 78.9% (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects). \n \nIn the open label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained \nfor up to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudies and an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis \nsuppurativa (HS) who were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-\nmonth trial of systemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III \ndisease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. \n \nStudy HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg \nevery week starting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the \nstudy. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in period A were re-\nrandomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to \nplacebo in Period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and \n40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral \nantibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab \nin period A were re-randomised in period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every \nweek, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had \nbeen randomised to placebo in period A were assigned to receive placebo in period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension \nstudy in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab \npopulation was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical Response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 \npoint scale.  \n \n\n\n\n81 \n\nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo \nachieved HiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Study HS-II experienced \na clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see Table 21). Patients treated with adalimumab \nhad significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment. \n \nTable 21:  Efficacy Results at 12 weeks, HS Studies I and II \n\n  \nHS Study I HS Study II \n\nPlacebo Adalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nPlacebo Adalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa \nClinical Response (HiSCR)a \n\nN = 154 \n40 (26.0%) \n\nN = 153 \n64 (41.8%) * \n\nN=163 \n45 (27.6%) \n\nN=163 \n96 (58.9%) *** \n\n\u226530% Reduction in Skin \nPainb \n\nN = 109 \n27 (24.8%) \n\nN = 122 \n34 (27.9%) \n\nN=111 \n23 (20.7%) \n\nN=105 \n48 (45.7%) *** \n\n* P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, adalimumab versus placebo  \na Among all randomised patients.  \nb Among patients with baseline HS-related skin pain assessment \u2265 3, based on Numeric Rating Scale  \n\n0 \u2013 10; 0 = no skin pain, 10 = skin pain as bad as you can imagine.  \n \nTreatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of \nabscesses and draining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in \nthe first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group \nexperienced worsening of abscesses (23.0% vs 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% vs \n13.9%, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-\nspecific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; \nStudies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the \nTreatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical \nhealth as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (Study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR rate at \nweek 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing \nfrequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see Table 22). \n \nTable 22:  Proportion of Patientsa Achieving HiSCRb at weeks 24 and 36 After Treatment \n\nReassignment from weekly Adalimumab at week 12 \n  \n\nPlacebo \n(treatment withdrawal) \n\nN = 73 \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg \nevery other week \n\nN = 70 \n\nAdalimumab \n40 mg weekly \n\nN = 70 \nWeek 24  24 (32.9%) 36 (51.4%) 40 (57.1%) \nWeek 36  22 (30.1%) 28 (40.0%) 39 (55.7%) \na Patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly after 12 weeks of treatment.  \nb Patients meeting protocol-specified criteria for loss of response or no improvement were required to \n\ndiscontinue from the studies and were counted as nonresponders.  \n \nAmong patients who were at least partial responders at week 12, and who received continuous weekly \nadalimumab therapy, the HiSCR rate at week 48 was 68.3% and at week 96 was 65.1%. Longer term \ntreatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings.. \n \nAmong patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, \nthe HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar \nto that observed before withdrawal (56.0 %). \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab \nfor the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure \nlevels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on \ncross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more \nfrequent doses (see section 5.2). \n \nCrohn's disease \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD Study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD Study II (GAIN). In CD Study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at \nweek 2. In CD Study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were \nrandomised to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at \nweeks 0 and 2. The primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these \npatients were not further evaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD Study III, \n854 patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other , 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u2265 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed \nseparately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted \nafter week 8. \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 23. \n \nTable 23: Induction of Clinical Remission and Response (Percent of Patients) \n \n CD Study I: Infliximab Naive Patients CD Study II: Infliximab \n\nExperienced Patients \n Placebo \n\nN=74 \nAdalimumab \n\n80/40 mg \nN = 75 \n\nAdalimumab \n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \nN=166 \n\nAdalimumab \n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \nWeek 4       \nClinical remission  12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \nClinical response \n(CR-100)  \n\n24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for adalimumab versus placebo  \n* p < 0.001  \n** p < 0.01  \n \nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n\nIn CD Study III, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in \nthe primary analysis.

Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in Table 24.  \nClinical remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist \nexposure. \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at week 56. \n \nTable 24: Maintenance of Clinical Remission and Response (Percent of Patients) \n  \n\nPlacebo 40 mg \nAdalimumab \n\nevery other week \n\n40 mg \nAdalimumab \nevery week \n\nWeek 26 N=170 N=172 N=157 \nClinical remission  17% 40%* 47%* \nClinical response (CR-100)  27% 52%* 52%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n3% (2/66) 19% (11/58)** 15% (11/74)** \n\nWeek 56 N=170 N=172 N=157 \nClinical remission  12% 36%* 41%* \nClinical response (CR-100)  17% 41%* 48%* \n\nPatients in steroid-free remission  \nfor >=90 daysa \n\n5% (3/66) 29% (17/58)* 20% (15/74)** \n\n*      p < 0.001 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions  \n**    p < 0.02 for adalimumab versus placebo pairwise comparisons of proportions  \na          Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline  \n \nAmong patients who were not in response at week 4, 43% of adalimumab maintenance patients \nresponded by week 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through \nweek 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed \nthrough at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, \ncontinued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and \n233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn CD Study I and CD Study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 \nand 56 in CD Study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo \ngroup. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body \nweight (< 40 kg or \u2265 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, \nwith moderate to severe Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index \n(PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid \n\n\n\n84 \n\nand/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been \nintolerant to infliximab.  \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their Baseline body weight: \n160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects \u2265 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for \nsubjects < 40 kg. \n \nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the Low \nDose or Standard Dose maintenance regimens as shown in Table 25. \n \nTable 25: Maintenance regimen \n \n\nPatient Weight Low dose Standard dose \n< 40 kg 10 mg eow 20 mg eow \n\u2265 40 kg 20 mg eow 40 mg eow \n\n \nEfficacy results \n \nThe primary endpoint of the study was clinical remission at week 26, defined as PCDAI score \u2264 10. \n \nClinical remission and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI score of at least 15 points \nfrom Baseline) rates are presented in Table 26.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in \nthe study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI. \n \nUlcerative Colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with \nmoderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) \nin randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist na\u00efve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at \nweeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at \nweek 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. After week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg \neow. Clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at week 8.  \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg \neow thereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for induction of \nremission at week 8 and for maintenance of remission at week 52.  \n \nPatients induced with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.031) and \nstudy UC-II (17% vs. 9% respectively, p=0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with \nadalimumab who were in remission at week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at week 52. \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in Table 28. \n \n\n\n\n86 \n\nTable 28: Response, Remission and Mucosal Healing in Study UC-II (Percent of Patients) \n  \n\nPlacebo Adalimumab 40 mg eow \n\nWeek 52  N=246 N=248 \nClinical Response  18% 30%* \nClinical Remission  9% 17%* \nMucosal Healing  15% 25%* \nSteroid-free remission for \u2265 90 days a 6% \n\n(N=140) \n13% * \n\n(N=150) \nWeek 8 and 52    \n\nSustained Response  12% 24%** \nSustained Remission  4% 8%* \nSustained Mucosal Healing  11% 19%* \n\nClinical remission is Mayo score \u2264 2 with no subscore > 1;  \nClinical response is decrease from baseline in Mayo score \u22653 points and \u226530% plus a decrease in the \nrectal bleeding subscore [RBS] \u22651 or an absolute RBS of 0 or 1;  \n* p<0.05 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions  \n**p<0.001 for adalimumab vs. placebo pairwise comparison of proportions  \na Of those receiving corticosteroids at baseline \n \nOf those patients who had a response at week 8, 47% were in response, 29% were in remission, 41% \nhad mucosal healing, and 20% were in steroid-free remission for \u2265 90 days at week 52. \n \nApproximately 40% of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. \nThe efficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF na\u00efve \npatients. Among patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, week 52 remission was achieved \nby 3% on placebo and 10% on adalimumab. \n \nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term \nextension study (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in \nclinical remission per partial Mayo score.  \n \nHospitalisation rates \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The \nnumber of all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year vs. \n0.26  per patient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related \nhospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year vs. 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score.  \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted.  \n \n\n\n\n87 \n\nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2- standardised dose of prednisone \n60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid \ndiscontinuation by week 15.  \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA).  \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical Response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 29). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see Figure 2). \n \nTable 29: Time to Treatment Failure in Studies UV I and UV II \n \nAnalysis \nTreatment \n\nN Failure \nN (%) \n\nMedian Time \nto Failure \n(months) \n\nHRa CI 95% \nfor HRa \n\nP Value b \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After week 6 in Study UV I \nPrimary analysis (ITT)  \n\n      \n\nPlacebo  107 84 (78.5) 3.0 -- -- -- \nAdalimumab  110 60 (54.5) 5.6 0.50 0.36, 0.70 < 0.001 \n\nTime to Treatment Failure At or After week 2 in Study UV II \nPrimary analysis (ITT)  \n\n      \n\nPlacebo  111 61 (55.0) 8.3 -- -- -- \nAdalimumab  115 45 (39.1) NEc 0.57 0.39, 0.84 0.004 \n\nNote: Treatment failure at or after week 6 (Study UV I), or at or after week 2 (Study UV II), was \ncounted as event.

In Study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no \nactive inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose \n\u2264 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or \nmaintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond Week 78 were \ngenerally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. \nOverall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and \n8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \n\n\n\n89 \n\nQuality of Life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in Study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in Study UV II. Vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in Study UVI and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in Study UV II. \n \nPaediatric Uveitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled \nstudy of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious \nanterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received \neither placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week \nin combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate.  \n \nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time.  \n \nClinical Response  \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n \n\n\n\n90 \n\nFigure 3:  Kaplan-Meier Curves Summarizing Time to Treatment Failure in the Paediatric \nUveitis Study \n\n \n\n \nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. \nFormation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy \nof adalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies \nand the occurrence of adverse events. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of the studies with \nthe reference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption and distribution \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \nto 15 ml/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \n\n\n\n91 \n\nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 \u03bcg/ml \n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u03bc g/ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6\u00b1 \n5.6 \u03bcg/ml (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/ml \n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 \u00b1 \n5.6 \u03bcg/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/ml for adalimumab \nwithout concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg/ml with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (\u00b1SD) trough steady-state concentration at \nweek 68 was 8.0 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b5g/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u03bcg/ml during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcg/ml (79% CV). \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 \u03bcg/ml at \nweek 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/ml during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since \nexposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and \ninadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 5.5 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u03bcg/ml were observed \nin Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \n\n\n\n92 \n\nAt week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7\u00b16.6 \u03bcg/ml for patients \u2265 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6\u00b16.1 \u03bcg/ml for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5\u00b15.6 \u03bcg/ml for the Standard Dose group and 3.5\u00b12.2 \u03bcg/ml for the \nLow Dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment eow for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from eow to weekly \nregimen, the mean (\u00b1SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 were 15.3\u00b111.4 \u03bcg/ml \n(40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7\u00b13.5 \u03bcg/ml (20/10 mg, weekly). \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/ml \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 \u03bcg/ml were observed \nin ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/ml. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was 3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n \nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nElimination \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower \nin patients with measurable AAA.  \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising \nantibodies in rodents. \n \n \n6.

Do not pass it on to others. It may harm \n\nthem, even if their signs of illness are the same as your child's.  \n- If your child gets any side effects, talk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist.

Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Hulio is and what it is used for \n \nHulio contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nHulio is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n \n- polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children aged 2-17 years;  \n- enthesitis-related arthritis in children aged 6-17 years;  \n- Crohn\u2019s disease in children aged 6-17 years  \n- plaque psoriasis in children aged 4-17 years;  \n- hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents aged 12-17 years; \n- chronic non-infectious uveitis in children aged 2-17 years affecting the front of the eye.  \n \nThe active ingredient in Hulio, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to specific target in the body.  \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Hulio decreases the \nprocess of inflammation in these diseases. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \nHulio is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to \n17 years, and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Your child may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, your child will be given Hulio to treat his/her polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or \nenthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nHulio is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in children aged 6 to 17 years. Your child may first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough your child will be given Hulio to reduce \nthe signs and symptoms of his/her Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \nHulio is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years whom \nmedicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not \nsuitable. \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called \u2018acne inversa\u2019) is a long-term and often painful \ninflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that \nmay leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the \narmpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas.  \n \nHulio is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adolescents from 12 years of age. Hulio can reduce \nthe number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with the disease. \nPatients may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, patients will \nbe given Hulio. \n \nChronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the front of the eye \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nleads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \nmove across the field of vision). Hulio works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nHulio is used to treat children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years with chronic non-infectious uveitis \nwho have inflammation affecting the front of the eye.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before giving your child Hulio  \n \nDo not give Hulio \n \n- If your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_disease\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_disease\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inframammary_fold\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inframammary_fold\n\n\n124 \n\n- If your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). It \nis important that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, \nwounds, feeling tired, dental problems.  \nIf your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child \nhas had or have a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d).  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Hulio. \n \nAllergic Reaction \n \nIf your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \nswelling or a rash do not inject them more Hulio and contact their doctor immediately since, in rare \ncases, these reactions can be life-threatening. \n \nInfections \n\u2022 If your child have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg \n\nulcer) consult your child\u2019s doctor before starting Hulio. If you are unsure, contact your child\u2019s \ndoctor. \n\n\u2022 Your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving Hulio treatment. This risk \nmay increase if your child lung function is reduced. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual \ninfectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-\nthreatening. It is important to tell your child\u2019s doctor if your child gets symptoms such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your child\u2019s doctor may recommend temporarily \nstopping Hulio. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your child\u2019s \n\ndoctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Hulio. This \nwill include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests \n(for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \nrecorded on child\u2019s Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your child\u2019s doctor \nif he/she have ever had tuberculosis, or if he/she have been in close contact with someone who \nhas had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child have had \npreventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight \nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \nchild\u2019s doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel/recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your child\u2019s doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\u2022 Tell your child\u2019s doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that \n\nincrease the risk of infections. \n \n\nHepatitis B virus  \n \n\n\u2022 Tell your child\u2019s doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has \nactive HBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your child\u2019s \ndoctor will test your child for HBV. Hulio can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry \nthis virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \nimmune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \n\n\n\n125 \n\nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\u2022 If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your child\u2019s doctor that your \n\nchild is taking Hulio. Their doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Hulio. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If your child has or develops demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \n\naround the nerves), such as multiple sclerosis, your child\u2019s doctor will decide if he/she should \nreceive or continue to receive Hulio. Tell your child\u2019s doctor immediately if your child gets \nsymptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part \nof the body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of bacteria or viruses that cause diseases \n\nand should not be given during treatment with Hulio in case they cause infections. Check with \nchild\u2019s doctor before receiving any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Hulio. If \nyour child received Hulio while pregnant, your child\u2019s baby may be at higher risk for getting \nan infection for up to about five months after the last dose she received during her pregnancy. \nIt is important that you tell the baby's doctors and other health care professionals about Hulio \nuse during your child\u2019s pregnancy so they can decide when your child\u2019s baby should receive \nany vaccine. \n\n \nHeart Failure \n \n\u2022 It is important to tell your child\u2019s doctor if your child had or have a serious heart condition. If \n\nyour child has mild heart failure and are being treated with Hulio, your child\u2019s heart failure \nstatus must be closely monitored by the doctor. If your child develops new or worsening \nsymptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of feet), you must contact your \nchild\u2019s doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight infections or \n\nhelp you to stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that does not go away, or bruises or \nbleeds very easily or look very pale, call your child\u2019s doctor right away. Your child\u2019s doctor \nmay decide to stop treatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Hulio the risk \nof getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific \nand severe type of lymphoma has been observed in some patients taking adalimumab. Some of \nthose patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your \nchild\u2019s doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Hulio.  \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your child\u2019s doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a \nspecific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with \nanother TNF\u03b1 blocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with \nyour child\u2019s doctor whether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for your child. \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \nOther medicines and Hulio \n \nTell your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \nother medicines. \n \nHulio can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n \nYour child should not take Hulio with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or \nabatacept. The combination of Hulio and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the \npossible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological \ninteractions. If you have questions, please ask your child\u2019s doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \n\n\u2022 Your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and \ncontinue its use for at least 5 months after their last Hulio injection.  \n\n\u2022 If your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her \ndoctor for advice about taking this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Hulio should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Hulio during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Hulio. \n\n\u2022 Hulio can be used during breast-feeding. \n\u2022 If your child receives Hulio during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting \n\nan infection.  \n\u2022 It is important that you tell her baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about her \n\nHulio\u2019s use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information \non vaccines, see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHulio may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Hulio. \n \nHulio contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nEach Hulio vial contains 38.2 mg of sorbitol. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your child\u2019s doctor has \ntold you that your child has an intolerance to some sugars or if your child has been diagnosed with \nhereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot break down \nfructose, talk to your child\u2019s doctor before you give your child this medicine. \n \nAlso this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Hulio \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist has instructed. Check with your \nchild\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about any of the instructions or if you have any \nquestions. Your doctor may prescribe another strength of Hulio if your child needs a different dose. \n \n\n\n\n127 \n\nChildren and adolescents with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 to 17 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 40 mg every other weeks. \n \nChildren and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 to 17 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 20 mg every other week.  \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 40 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents with Crohn's disease \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 to 17 years of age weighing less than 40 kg: \nThe usual dose regimen is 40 mg initially, followed by 20 mg two weeks later.

If you don\u2019t know this, STOP HERE and ask your \nchild\u2019s doctor. \n \nFind a quiet area with a well-lit, clean and flat work surface and gather all the supplies you will need \nto give the injection. \n \nSupplies you will need: \n\u2022 1 box of Hulio vial for paediatric use \n\u2022 1 sharps disposal container (not included in Hulio pack) \n\u2022 1 gauze pad or cotton ball (not included in Hulio pack) \n \n\n\n\n134 \n\nIf you do not have all the supplies you need, ask your nurse or pharmacist. \n \nPreparing the Hulio injection \n \nEach Hulio single vial box will contain: \n\n\u2022 1 syringe (1) \n\u2022 1 vial adapter (2) \n\u2022 1 vial of Hulio solution (3) \n\u2022 2 alcohol pads (4)  \n\u2022 1 needle (5) \n\n  \n \nHulio packs should be stored in the fridge (between 2 to 8\u00b0C) until needed for use.  \n\u2022 Take a single vial box out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before you intend to use it to allow the \n\ncontents to reach room temperature. If there is a second box in the Hulio pack for a future \ninjection, place it back in the refrigerator immediately. \no DO NOT use other heat sources such as a microwave oven or hot water to warm the vial. \no DO NOT put the vial back in the fridge after it has reached room temperature. \n\n\u2022 Check the expiry date printed on the vial.  \no DO NOT use the vial if past the expiry date. \n\n\u2022 Check the solution in the vial is clear, colourless and has no particles.  \no DO NOT use the vial if the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or has particles in it.  \n\n \nInjection steps  \n \nFollow the steps below carefully each time you inject Hulio: \n \nStep 1 - Choose and prepare injection site \n\n \n \n\nAbdomen or Thighs \n\nHulio is for subcutaneous injection. It should be injected into the \nthigh or abdomen. \n \nYou should rotate and change the injection site each time, \nstaying at least 3 cm from the previous site used. \n \nIf you are injecting into the abdomen, choose a site that is at \nleast 5 cm away from the belly button. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT inject into skin that is red, hard, bruised, or tender.  \n\u2022 DO NOT inject into scars or stretch marks. \n\u2022 If your child has psoriasis, DO NOT inject into any raised, \n\nthick, red, or scaly skin patches, or lesions. \n\u2022 DO NOT inject through clothes. Roll back any clothing that \n\nmay interfere with the injection site. \nStep 2 - Wash hands \nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n \nPreparing the Hulio dose for injection \n \n\n\n\n135 \n\nStep 3 \u2013 Partially open syringe and needle packaging \n\n  \n\nPartially peel open the syringe package from the end closest to \nthe white plunger rod. Peel the clear plastic just far enough to \nexpose the white plunger rod, but DO NOT take the syringe out \nof the package. \n \nPartially peel open the needle package from the end closest to \nthe yellow syringe connector. Peel the clear plastic just far \nenough to expose the yellow connector, but DO NOT take the \nneedle out of the package. \n\nStep 4 - Uncap vial and wipe vial stopper \n\n   \n\nPop off the white plastic cap from the vial to expose the vial \nstopper. \n \nUse one of the alcohol pads to wipe the stopper and then place \nthe vial on a flat surface. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT touch the vial stopper after wiping with the alcohol \n\npad. \nStep 5 - Attach vial adapter to vial \n\n \n\nPeel the cover off the vial adapter package but DO NOT take \nthe adapter out of the package. \n \n\n  \n\n \nWith the vial adapter still in the clear package, attach it to the \nvial stopper by pushing the adapter over the vial until it snaps in \nplace. \n \nWhen you are sure the adapter is attached to the vial, lift off the \npackaging. \nGently set the connected vial and adapter down on a flat work \nsurface. Be careful that it does not fall over. \n\nStep 6 - Pull plunger to dose + 0.1 ml \n\n \n\nHold the syringe package and SLOWLY pull the white plunger to 0.1 ml \nbeyond the prescribed dose (for example, if the prescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull \nthe white plunger rod to 0.6 ml).   \nDO NOT pull the white plunger rod completely out of the syringe.  \n \n\u2022 If the white plunger rod is pulled out of the syringe, discard the syringe and \n\ncontact your Hulio provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the \nwhite plunger rod. \n\nStep 7 - Attach syringe to vial adapter and push plunger rod \n\n \n\nHold the syringe on the graduated area and remove it from the packaging. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT hold the syringe by the white plunger rod. \n \nInsert the syringe tip into the vial adapter and twist it clockwise until firmly \nattached.  \n \n\u2022 DO NOT over-tighten. \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\nPush the plunger rod all the way down. This step is important to get the proper \ndose. \n\nStep 8 - Pull plunger to draw dose + 0.1 ml \n\n \n \n\nKeep the plunger rod pressed down and turn the connected syringe and vial \nupside down. \n \nSLOWLY pull the plunger rod to draw the Hulio solution into the syringe. Pull \nthe plunger to 0.1 ml beyond the prescribed dose (for example, if the \nprescribed dose is 0.5 ml, pull the white plunger rod to 0.6 ml). \n \nYou will set the volume to the prescribed dose in a later step. \n \n\n \n\nIf there are air bubbles in the syringe, push the plunger rod all the way back in \nto push the solution back into the vial.  \n \nRepeat this step to draw the solution back into the syringe again, pulling the \nplunger rod SLOWLY.  \n \nIf you see air bubbles in the solution again, you may repeat this step up to \n3 times. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT hold the syringe by the plunger rod. \n\u2022 DO NOT shake the syringe.  \n\u2022 If the white plunger rod is pulled out of the syringe, discard the syringe and \n\ncontact your Hulio provider for a replacement. DO NOT try to reinsert the \nwhite plunger rod. \n\nStep 9 - Detach syringe from vial adapter and attach needle \n\n \n \n\nRemove the vial adapter by twisting it off the syringe. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT touch the top of the syringe. \n\u2022 DO NOT hold the syringe by the white plunger rod.  \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nAttach the needle to the syringe by inserting the syringe tip into the yellow \nsyringe connector on the needle. Twist the syringe until the needle is firmly \nattached.  \n \n\u2022 Once syringe is firmly attached to the needle, remove the clear needle \n\npackaging. \n\n \nDose Preparation \n \nStep 10 - Flip down pink needle cover and remove needle cap \n\n  \n\nHold the syringe with the needle pointing up. \nFlip down the pink needle cover and remove the needle cap by pulling it \nstraight up. DO NOT twist the needle cap.  \n \n\u2022 DO NOT touch the needle. \n\u2022 DO NOT put the needle cap back on the needle after it has been removed. \n\nStep 11 - Check and set prescribed dose \nHold the syringe at eye-level with the needle pointing up to see the amount of solution clearly.  \nRecheck the doctor\u2019s prescription for the correct prescribed amount. \nPush the plunger rod gently in until the syringe contains the prescribed amount. Excess solution may \ncome out of the needle while pushing the plunger rod in. Be careful not to squirt the solution into your \neye. \nGently place the syringe on a clean, flat surface. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT wipe the needle or syringe. \n \nInjecting Hulio \n \nStep 12 - Prepare injection site \nWipe the skin at the chosen injection site with a new alcohol swab.  \n\u2022 Wait for the skin to dry on its own, do not blow it dry. \n\u2022 DO NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. \nStep 13 - Squeeze injection site  \n\n \n\nGently squeeze the cleaned area of skin and hold firmly. \n\n \n\n \nAt a 45\u00b0 angle to the injection site, use a quick, short motion and \npush the needle all the way into skin. \n\n\n\n138 \n\nStep 14 - Push plunger to inject solution \n\n  \n\nLet go of the squeezed skin. \nPush the white plunger rod to inject the Hulio solution until the \nsyringe is empty.  \n \n\nStep 15 - End of injection, remove syringe, engage needle cover \n\n  \n \n\nWhen the syringe is empty, remove syringe and needle from the \nskin.  \nAfter injection, if slight bleeding occurs from the injection site, \nlightly press a gauze or cotton ball against the site for a few \nseconds. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT rub the injection site. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nGently flip the pink needle cover over the needle and snap into \nplace. Set the syringe with covered needle on the work surface.  \n\n \n\u2022 DO NOT put the clear needle cap back on the needle. \n\n \n \nThrowing away supplies \n \nStep 16 - Dispose syringe & needle \nEach vial, syringe, vial adapter and needle are for single-use only. These must NEVER be re-used.  \n \nPut the used syringe, needle, vial and vial adapter in a sharps disposal container after use. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT throw the sharps container in your household bin.  \n\u2022 DO NOT recycle your used sharps disposal container. \n\u2022 Always keep your sharps container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\u2022 Throw away all other used items and empty packaging into your regular \n\nhousehold waste. \n \n \n\n\n\n139 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nHulio 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \nadalimumab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Hulio is and what it is used for \n \nHulio contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system. \n \nHulio is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n- rheumatoid arthritis; \n- polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis; \n- enthesitis-related arthritis; \n- ankylosing spondylitis; \n- axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis; \n- psoriatic arthritis; \n- psoriasis; \n- hidradenitis suppurativa; \n- Crohn\u2019s disease; \n- ulcerative colitis; \n- non-infectious uveitis in adults and children. \n \nThe active ingredient in Hulio, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to specific target in the body.  \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Hulio decreases the \nprocess of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n140 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHulio is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, you will be given Hulio to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. \n \nHulio can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHulio can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function. \n \nUsually, Hulio is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nHulio can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n \nHulio is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to \n17 years, and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. You may first \nbe given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not work \nwell enough, you will be given Hulio to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or \nenthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHulio is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence \nof ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Hulio to reduce the signs and symptoms \nof your disease. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nHulio is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Hulio can slow down the damage to the cartilage and \nbone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \n\n\n\n141 \n\nHulio is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Hulio is also used to treat severe \nplaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years whom medicines applied to the skin \nand treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called \u2018acne inversa\u2019) is a long-term and often painful \ninflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that \nmay leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the \narmpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHulio is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults, and adolescents from 12 years of age. Hulio \ncan reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you \nwill be given Hulio. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nHulio is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults, and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn\u2019s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Hulio to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nHulio is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Hulio to reduce the \nsigns and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nleads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \nmove across the field of vision). Hulio works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nHulio is used to treat: \n- adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye.  \n- children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years with chronic non-infectious uveitis who have \n\ninflammation affecting the front of the eye.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Hulio  \n \nDo not use Hulio \n \n- If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems. \n\n- If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \nor have a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d).  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Hulio. \n \nAllergic Reaction \n \nIf you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \na rash, do not inject more Hulio and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life-threatening. \n \nInfections \n \n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Hulio. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Hulio treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual \ninfectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-\nthreatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Hulio. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Hulio. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on \nyour Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for \ntuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel/recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the \n\nrisk of infections. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor will test you for \nHBV. Hulio can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \nHBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \nAge over 65 years \n \n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Hulio. You and \n\nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHulio. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\n\n\n143 \n\nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your doctor that you are taking Hulio. \n\nYour doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Hulio. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves), such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Hulio. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, \nweakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of bacteria or viruses that cause diseases \n\nand should not be given during treatment with Hulio in case they cause infections. Check with \nyour doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Hulio. If you \nreceived Hulio while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection \nfor up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important \nthat you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Hulio use during \nyour pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n  \nHeart Failure \n \n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \n\nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Hulio your heart failure status must be closely \nmonitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight infections or \n\nhelp you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Hulio the risk of \ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and \nsevere type of lymphoma has been observed in some patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Hulio.  \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a \nspecific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with \nanother TNF\u03b1 blocker. If you have COPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with \nyour doctor whether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and chronic non-\n\ninfectious uveitis below the age of 2 years.  \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with enthesitis-related arthritis and Crohn's disease below the age \n\nof 6 years. \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with plaque psoriasis below the age of 4 years. \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with hidradenitis suppurativa below the age of 12 years. \n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Hulio \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nHulio can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Hulio with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept. The \ncombination of Hulio and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible \nincreased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological \ninteractions. If you have questions, please ask your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \n\n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \nuse for at least 5 months after the last Hulio injection.  \n\n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Hulio should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Hulio during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Hulio. \n\n\u2022 Hulio can be used during breast-feeding. \n\u2022 If you received Hulio during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection.  \n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHulio use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information \non vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHulio may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Hulio. \n \nHulio contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nEach Hulio pre-filled syringe contains 38.2 mg of sorbitol. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your \ndoctor has told you that you (or your child) have an intolerance to some sugars or if you have been \ndiagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot \nbreak down fructose, talk to your doctor before you (or your child) take or receive this medicine. \n \nAlso this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled syringe, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n3.

Instructions for use \n \nRead the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor, nurse or other healthcare \nprofessional will first show you how to inject Hulio pre-filled syringe. Ask your doctor or nurse if \nthere is anything you do not understand. \n \nDo not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and administer the \ninjection. After proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for \nexample a family member or carer. \n \nEach pre-filled syringe is for single-use only and contains one 40 mg dose of adalimumab. \n \nDo not mix the Hulio solution with any other medicine. \n \n\n\n\n153 \n\nTo help you remember which day(s) of the week Hulio should be injected, it may be helpful to make a \nnote on a calendar or in a diary. \n \nBefore you start \n \nFind a quiet area with a well-lit, clean and flat work surface and gather all the supplies you will need \nto give yourself or receive the injection. \n \nSupplies you will need: \n\u2022 1 pre-filled syringe  \n\u2022 1 alcohol swab \n\u2022 1 sharps disposal container (not included in Hulio pack) \n\u2022 1 gauze pad or cotton ball (not included in Hulio pack) \n \nIf you do not have all the supplies you need, ask your nurse or pharmacist. \n \nPreparing the pre-filled syringe \n \nThe pre-filled syringes should be stored in the fridge (between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).  \n\u2022 Take a single pre-filled syringe out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before you intend to use it to \n\nallow the contents to reach room temperature.  \no DO NOT use other heat sources such as a microwave oven or hot water to warm the syringe. \no DO NOT put the syringe back in the fridge after it has reached room temperature. \n\n\u2022 Check the expiry date printed on the syringe.  \no DO NOT use the syringe if past the expiry date. \n\n\u2022 Check syringe to make sure the medication is at or near the Fill Marker (you may need to shake \ngently to see the liquid), and the liquid is clear, colourless and has no particles.  \n\no DO NOT use the syringe if the medication is not near the Fill Marker.  \no DO NOT use the syringe if the liquid is cloudy, discoloured, or has particles in it.  \n\n \n \n\n        Needle Cap             Fill Marker    Plunger Rod \n\n \n    Medication        Needle Safety Feature \n\n \nInjection steps  \n \nFollow the below steps carefully each time you inject Hulio pre-filled syringe: \n \n\nStep 1 - Choose and prepare injection site \n Hulio pre-filled syringe is for subcutaneous injection. It \n\nshould be injected into the thigh or abdomen. \n \nYou should rotate and change your injection site each \ntime, staying at least 3 cm from the previous site used. \n \n\n\n\n154 \n\n \n \n\nAbdomen or Thighs \n \n\nIf you are injecting into the abdomen, choose a site that is \nat least 5 cm away from the belly button. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT inject into skin that is red, hard, bruised, or \n\ntender.  \n\u2022 DO NOT inject into scars or stretch marks. \n\u2022 If you have psoriasis, DO NOT inject into any raised, \n\nthick, red, or scaly skin patches, or lesions. \n\u2022 DO NOT inject through clothes. Roll back any clothing \n\nthat may interfere with the injection site. \n\nStep 2 - Wash hands \n Wash your hands with soap and water. \nStep 3 - Prepare injection site \n Wipe the skin at the chosen injection site with an alcohol swab.  \n\n\u2022 Wait for it to dry on its own, do not blow dry it. \n\u2022 DO NOT touch this area again before giving the injection. \n\nStep 4 - Uncap needle \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nPull the needle cover straight off the syringe. A few \ndrops of liquid may come out of the needle, this is \nnormal. It is also normal to see air bubble(s). \n \n\u2022 DO NOT remove the needle cover until you are ready \n\nto inject. \n\u2022 DO NOT twist or bend the needle cover while \n\nremoving it, this may damage the needle. \n\u2022 DO NOT touch or pull back on the plunger at any \n\ntime. \n\u2022 DO NOT re-cap or touch the needle with your \n\nfingers, or let the needle touch anything. \n\u2022 DO NOT expel any air bubble(s). \n\u2022 DO NOT use the pre-filled syringe if dropped after \n\nuncapping. \nStep 5 - Squeeze & hold injection site \n\n \n \n\nGently squeeze the injection site to create a raised area, \nand hold that area firmly. \n\nStep 6 - Insert needle into site \n\n \n\nAt a 45\u00b0 angle to the injection site, use a quick dart-like \nmotion to insert the needle into the site. \n \nBe careful to insert the needle so that it will not inject \ninto your fingers holding the injection site. \n\n\n\n155 \n\nStep 7 - Inject Hulio \n\n \n\nAfter the needle is completely inserted, let go of the site \nyou are squeezing. \n \nSlowly push the plunger completely down until all the \nmedicine is injected and the syringe is empty. \n \n\u2022 If the plunger is not pressed all the way the safety \n\nfeature will not activate afterwards to cover the \nneedle. \n\n\u2022 DO NOT move, twist, or rotate the syringe during \ninjection. \n\nStep 8 - End of injection, remove syringe \n \n \n \n\n \n\nPull the syringe away from the injection site at the same \nangle as inserted and release your thumb from the \nplunger. \n \nEach pre-filled syringe has a safety feature, this will \nretract and cover the needle after the plunger is released. \nIf the needle did not retract, carefully place the used \nsyringe into a sharps container to avoid injury. \n \nAfter injection, if slight bleeding occurs from the \ninjection site, press a gauze pad or cotton ball lightly \nagainst the skin for a few seconds - DO NOT rub the \ninjection site.

Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Hulio is and what it is used for \n \nHulio contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n(defence) system.  \n \nHulio is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases:  \n- rheumatoid arthritis; \n- polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis; \n- enthesitis-related arthritis; \n- ankylosing spondylitis; \n- axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis; \n- psoriatic arthritis; \n- psoriasis; \n- hidradenitis suppurativa; \n- Crohn\u2019s disease; \n- ulcerative colitis; \n- non-infectious uveitis in adults and children. \n \nThe active ingredient in Hulio, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \nproteins that attach to specific target in the body.  \nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Hulio decreases the \nprocess of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n157 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n \nHulio is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active rheumatoid \narthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these \nmedicines do not work well enough, you will be given Hulio to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. \n \nHulio can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \nmethotrexate treatment. \n \nHulio can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nimprove physical function. \n \nUsually, Hulio is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is inappropriate, \nHulio can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n \nHulio is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged \n2 to 17 years, and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. You may \nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \nwork well enough, you will be given Hulio to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or \nenthesitis-related arthritis. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n \nHulio is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence \nof ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other medicines. If \nthese medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Hulio to reduce the signs and symptoms \nof your disease. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n \nHulio is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Hulio can slow down the damage to the cartilage and \nbone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \ncells. \n \n\n\n\n158 \n\nHulio is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Hulio is also used to treat severe \nplaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years whom medicines applied to the skin \nand treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called \u2018acne inversa\u2019) is a long-term and often painful \ninflammatory skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that \nmay leak pus. It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the \narmpits, inner thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nHulio is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults, and adolescents from 12 years of age. Hulio \ncan reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often associated with \nthe disease. You may first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you \nwill be given Hulio. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n \nHulio is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults, and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have Crohn\u2019s \ndisease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, \nyou will be given Hulio to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n \nUlcerative colitis \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nHulio is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be given \nother medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Hulio to reduce the \nsigns and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. This inflammation \nleads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \nmove across the field of vision). Hulio works by reducing this inflammation. \n \nHulio is used to treat: \n- adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye.  \n- children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years with chronic non-infectious uveitis who have \n\ninflammation affecting the front of the eye.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Hulio  \n \nDo not use Hulio \n \n- If you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- If you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems. \n\n- If you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had \nor have a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\n\n\n159 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Hulio. \n \nAllergic Reaction \n \nIf you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or \na rash, do not inject more Hulio and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these \nreactions can be life-threatening. \n \nInfections \n \n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting Hulio. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Hulio treatment. This risk may \n\nincrease if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual \ninfectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-\nthreatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Hulio. \n\n \nTuberculosis (TB) \n \n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Hulio. This will include a \nthorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on \nyour Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had \ntuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. \nTuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for \ntuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild \nfever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \nTravel/recurrent infection \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the \n\nrisk of infections. \n \nHepatitis B virus \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor will test you for \nHBV. Hulio can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \nHBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \nAge over 65 years \n \n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Hulio. You and \n\nyour doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with \nHulio. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\n\n\n160 \n\nSurgery or dental procedure \n \n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your doctor that you are taking Hulio. \n\nYour doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Hulio. \n \nDemyelinating disease \n \n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \n\nthe nerves), such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \nto receive Hulio. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, \nweakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. \n\n \nVaccine \n \n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of bacteria or viruses that cause diseases \n\nand should not be given during treatment with Hulio in case they cause infections. Check with \nyour doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Hulio. If you \nreceived Hulio while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection \nfor up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important \nthat you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your Hulio use during \nyour pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n  \nHeart Failure \n \n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \n\nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Hulio your heart failure status must be closely \nmonitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. \nshortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n \n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight infections or \n\nhelp you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \ntreatment. \n\n \nCancer \n \n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Hulio the risk of \ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and \nsevere type of lymphoma has been observed in some patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Hulio.  \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a \nspecific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with \nanother TNF\u03b1 blocker. If you have COPD, or you are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with \nyour doctor whether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \n\n\n\n161 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and chronic non-\n\ninfectious uveitis below the age of 2 years.  \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with enthesitis-related arthritis and Crohn's disease below the age \n\nof 6 years. \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with plaque psoriasis below the age of 4 years. \n\u2022 Do not give Hulio to children with hidradenitis suppurativa below the age of 12 years. \n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Hulio \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nHulio can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n \nYou should not take Hulio with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept. The \ncombination of Hulio and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible \nincreased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological \ninteractions. If you have questions, please ask your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n \n\n\u2022 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \nuse for at least 5 months after the last Hulio injection.  \n\n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\n\u2022 Hulio should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\u2022 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived Hulio during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \nreceive Hulio. \n\n\u2022 Hulio can be used during breast-feeding. \n\u2022 If you received Hulio during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection.  \n\u2022 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nHulio use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more information \non vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nHulio may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Hulio. \n \nHulio contains sodium and sorbitol \n \nEach Hulio pre-filled pen contains 38.2 mg of sorbitol. Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If your doctor \nhas told you that you (or your child) have an intolerance to some sugars or if you have been diagnosed \nwith hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot break \ndown fructose, talk to your doctor before you (or your child) take or receive this medicine. \n \nAlso this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per pre-filled pen, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.  \n \n\n\n\n162 \n\n \n3. How to use Hulio \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor may prescribe another strength of Hulio if you need a \ndifferent dose. \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with these conditions is 40 mg adalimumab given every two weeks as a \nsingle dose. \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using Hulio. If your doctor determines that \nmethotrexate is inappropriate, Hulio can be given alone. \n \nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis and you do not receive methotrexate with your Hulio therapy, your \ndoctor may decide to give you 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 2 to 17 years of age weighing 10 kg to less than 30 kg: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 20 mg every other week. \n  \nChildren and adolescents from 2 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 40 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 to 17 years of age weighing 15 kg to less than 30 kg: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 20 mg every other week. \n \nChildren and adolescents from 6 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kg or more: \nThe recommended dose of Hulio is 40 mg every other week. \n \nAdults with psoriasis \n \nThe usual dose for adults with psoriasis is an initial dose of 80 mg (as two 40 mg injections in one \nday), followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose.

Instructions for use \n \nRead the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor, nurse or other healthcare \nprofessional will first show you how to inject Hulio pre-filled pen. Ask your doctor or nurse if there is \nanything you do not understand. \n \nDo not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and administer the \ninjection. After proper training, the injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for \nexample a family member or carer. \n \nEach pre-filled pen is for single-use only and contains one 40 mg dose of adalimumab. \n \nDo not mix the Hulio solution with any other medicine. \n\n\n\n170 \n\n \nTo help you remember which day(s) of the week Hulio should be injected, it may be helpful to make a \nnote on a calendar or in a diary. \n \nBefore you start \n \nFind a quiet area with a well-lit, clean and flat work surface and gather all the supplies you will need \nto give yourself or receive the injection. \n \nSupplies you will need: \n\u2022 1 pre-filled pen  \n\u2022 1 alcohol swab \n\u2022 1 sharps disposal container (not included in Hulio pack) \n\u2022 1 gauze pad or cotton ball (not included in Hulio pack) \n \nIf you do not have all the supplies you need, ask your nurse or pharmacist. \n \nPreparing the pre-filled pen \n \nThe pre-filled pens should be stored in the fridge (between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).  \n\u2022 Take a single pen out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before you intend to use it to allow the \n\ncontents to reach room temperature.  \no DO NOT use other heat sources such as a microwave oven or hot water to warm the pen. \no DO NOT put the pen back in the fridge after it has reached room temperature. \n\n\u2022 Check the expiry date printed on the pen.  \no DO NOT use the pen if past the expiry date. \n\n\u2022 Check the viewing window to make sure the medication is at or near the Fill Marker (you may \nneed to shake gently to see this), and the liquid is clear, colourless and has no particles.  \n\no DO NOT use the pen if the medication is not near the Fill Marker.  \no DO NOT use the pen if the liquid is cloudy, discoloured, or has particles in it.  \n\n \n \n     Orange Activator \n       (Needle Inside) Medication    Orange Indicator \n\n \n \n\n    Needle Cap   Viewing Window       Fill Marker \n \nInjection steps  \n \nFollow the steps below carefully each time you inject Hulio pre-filled pen: \n \nStep 1 - Choose and prepare injection site \n\n Hulio pre-filled pen is for subcutaneous injection. It should be \ninjected into the thigh or abdomen. \n \nYou should rotate and change your injection site each time, \nstaying at least 3 cm from the previous site used. \n \nIf you are injecting into the abdomen, choose a site that is at \nleast 5 cm away from the belly button. \n\n\n\n171 \n\n \n \n\nAbdomen or Thighs \n \n\n \n\u2022 DO NOT inject into skin that is red, hard, bruised, or \n\ntender.  \n\u2022 DO NOT inject into scars or stretch marks. \n\u2022 If you have psoriasis, DO NOT inject into any raised, thick, \n\nred, or scaly skin patches, or lesions. \n\u2022 DO NOT inject through clothes.

Components inside the pen may be broken.  \n\u2022 DO NOT use the pen if the needle cap is missing or not \n\nsecurely attached. \nStep 5 - Squeeze & hold injection site \n\n \n \n\nGently squeeze the injection site to create a raised \narea, and hold that area firmly. \n\nStep 6 - Place pen \n\n \n\nPlace the Orange Activator end of the pen onto the \ninjection site. \n \nKeep the pen held at a 90\u00b0 angle to the injection site, \nand with the Viewing Window visible to you. \n \nBe careful to place the pen so that it will not inject \ninto your fingers holding the injection site. \n\nStep 7 - Begin injection \nStep 8 - Hold down for 2nd \u201cCLICK\u201d & 10 seconds \n\n\n\n172 \n\n \n \n\nStep 7  \n \nFirmly push the body of the pen down against \nthe injection site to engage the Orange \nActivator and begin the injection. \n \nContinue holding down after hearing the 1st \n\u201cCLICK\u201d. This 1st \u201cCLICK\u201d signals the start \nof the injection. \n \nIn the Viewing Window, the Orange \nIndicator will advance to show the progress \nof the injection. \n \n\u2022 DO NOT move, twist, or rotate the pen \n\nduring injection. \n\nStep 8  \n \nContinue holding the body of the pen down against \nthe injection site until one, or all, of the following \noccur: \n \n\u2022 A 2nd \u201cCLICK\u201d is heard, \n\u2022 10 seconds has passed, \n\u2022 Orange Indicator has stopped and completely \n\nblocked the Viewing Window. \n\nStep 9 - End of injection, remove pen \n\n \n\nPull the pen straight away from injection site. \n \nAfter injection, if slight bleeding occurs from the injection site, \npress a gauze pad or cotton ball lightly against the skin for a \nfew seconds - DO NOT rub the injection site.

of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis (see \"warnings and precautions\"). it is important that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems. if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. it is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or have a serious heart condition (see \"warnings and precautions\"). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using hulio. allergic reaction if your child has allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or a rash do not inject them more hulio and contact their doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these reactions can be life-threatening. infections if your child have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your child's doctor before starting hulio. if you are unsure, contact your child's doctor. your child might get infections more easily while he/she is receiving hulio treatment. this risk may increase if your child lung function is reduced. these infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). in rare cases, these infections may be life- threatening. it is important to tell your child's doctor if your child gets symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. your child's doctor may recommend temporarily stopping hulio. tuberculosis (tb) as cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your child's doctor will check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting hulio. this will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). the conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on child's patient reminder card. it is very important that you tell your child's doctor if he/she have ever had tuberculosis, or if he/she have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child have had preventative treatment for tuberculosis. if symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your child's doctor immediately. travel/recurrent infection tell your child's doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. tell your child's doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections. hepatitis b virus tell your child's doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis b virus (hbv), if he/she has active hbv infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of contracting hbv. your child's doctor will test your child for hbv. hulio can reactivate hbv infection in people who carry this virus. in some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of hbv infection can be life-threatening. surgery or dental procedure if your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures, tell your child's doctor that your child is taking hulio. their doctor may recommend temporarily stopping hulio. demyelinating disease if your child has or develops demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves), such as multiple sclerosis, your child's doctor will decide if he/she should receive or continue to receive hulio. tell your child's doctor immediately if your child gets symptoms like changes in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. vaccine certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of bacteria or viruses that cause diseases and should not be given during treatment with hulio in case they cause infections. check with child's doctor before receiving any vaccines. it is recommended that, if possible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with hulio. if your child received hulio while pregnant, your child's baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose she received during her pregnancy. it is important that you tell the baby's doctors and other health care professionals about hulio use during your child's pregnancy so they can decide when your child's baby should receive any vaccine. heart failure it is important to tell your child's doctor if your child had or have a serious heart condition. if your child has mild heart failure and are being treated with hulio, your child's heart failure status must be closely monitored by the doctor. if your child develops new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of feet), you must contact your child's doctor immediately. fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale in some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight infections or help you to stop bleeding. if your child develops a fever that does not go away, or bruises or bleeds very easily or look very pale, call your child's doctor right away. your child's doctor may decide to stop treatment. cancer there have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or other tnf\u03b1 blockers. people with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). if your child takes hulio the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. on rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in some patients taking adalimumab. some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. tell your child's doctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with hulio. in addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. if new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your child's doctor. there have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, have been reported in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) treated with another tnf\u03b1 blocker. if your child has copd, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your child's doctor whether treatment with a tnf\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for your child. other medicines and hulio tell your child's doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. hulio can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). your child should not take hulio with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept. the combination of hulio and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. if you have questions, please ask your child's doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding your child should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after their last hulio injection. if your child is pregnant, thinks she may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask her doctor for advice about taking this medicine. hulio should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. according to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received hulio during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive hulio. hulio can be used during breast-feeding. if your child receives hulio during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. it is important that you tell her baby's doctors and other health care professionals about her hulio's use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. for more information on vaccines, see \"warnings and precautions\" section. driving and using machines hulio may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. room spinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking hulio. hulio contains sodium and sorbitol each hulio vial contains 38.2 mg of sorbitol. sorbitol is a source of fructose. if your child's doctor has told you that your child has an intolerance to some sugars or if your child has been diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi), a rare genetic disorder in which a person cannot break down fructose, talk to your child's doctor before you give your child this medicine. also this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "hulio", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "allergic", "Type": "PROBLEM", "BeginOffset": 37, "EndOffset": 45}, {"Id":
