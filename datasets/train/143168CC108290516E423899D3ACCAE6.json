NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nINVANZ 1 g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach vial contains 1.0 g ertapenem.\n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach 1.0 g dose contains approximately 6.0 mEq of sodium (approximately 137 mg).\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nWhite to off-white powder.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nTreatment\n\nINVANZ is indicated in paediatric patients (3 months to 17 years of age) and in adults for the\ntreatment of the following infections when caused by bacteria known or very likely to be susceptible \nto ertapenem and when parenteral therapy is required (see sections 4.4 and 5.1):\n\n\uf0b7 Intra-abdominal infections\n\uf0b7 Community acquired pneumonia\n\uf0b7 Acute gynaecological infections\n\uf0b7 Diabetic foot infections of the skin and soft tissue (see section 4.4)\n\nPrevention\n\nINVANZ is indicated in adults for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection following elective \ncolorectal surgery (see section 4.4).\n\nConsideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\n\nTreatment\nAdults and adolescents (13 to 17 years of age): The dose of INVANZ is 1 gram (g) given once a day \nby the intravenous route (see section 6.6).\n\nInfants and children (3 months to 12 years of age): The dose of INVANZ is 15 mg/kg given twice \ndaily (not to exceed 1 g/day) by the intravenous route (see section 6.6).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nPrevention\nAdults: To prevent surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery, the recommended \ndosage is 1 g administered as a single intravenous dose to be completed within 1 hour prior to the \nsurgical incision.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of INVANZ in children below 3 months of age have not yet been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nRenal impairment\nINVANZ may be used for the treatment of infections in adult patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment. In patients whose creatinine clearance is \uf03e 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, no dosage adjustment is \nnecessary. There are inadequate data on the safety and efficacy of ertapenem in patients with severe \nrenal impairment to support a dose recommendation. Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these \npatients (see section 5.2.). There are no data in children and adolescents with renal impairment.\n\nHaemodialysis\nThere are inadequate data on the safety and efficacy of ertapenem in patients on haemodialysis to \nsupport a dose recommendation. Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these patients.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 5.2).\n\nElderly\nThe recommended dose of INVANZ should be administered, except in cases of severe renal \nimpairment (see Renal impairment).\n\nMethod of administration\n\nIntravenous administration: INVANZ should be infused over a period of 30 minutes.\n\nThe usual duration of therapy with INVANZ is 3 to 14 days but may vary depending on the type and \nseverity of infection and causative pathogen(s). When clinically indicated, a switch to an appropriate \noral antibacterial agent may be implemented if clinical improvement has been observed.\n\nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to any other carbapenem antibacterial agent\n\uf0b7 Severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction, severe skin reaction) to any other type of \n\nbeta-lactam antibacterial agent (e.g., penicillins or cephalosporins).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHypersensitivity\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients \nreceiving therapy with beta-lactams. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a \nhistory of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with ertapenem, careful inquiry \nshould be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other \nbeta-lactams and other allergens (see section 4.3). If an allergic reaction to ertapenem occurs (see \nsection 4.8), discontinue the therapy immediately. Serious anaphylactic reactions require \nimmediate emergency treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nSuperinfection\nProlonged use of ertapenem may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated \nevaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate \nmeasures should be taken.\n\nAntibiotic-associated colitis\nAntibiotic-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with ertapenem and \nmay range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this \ndiagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial \nagents. Discontinuation of therapy with INVANZ and the administration of specific treatment for \nClostridium difficile should be considered. Medicinal products that inhibit peristalsis should not be \ngiven.\n\nSeizures\nSeizures have been reported during clinical investigation in adult patients treated with ertapenem (1 g \nonce a day) during therapy or in the 14-day follow-up period. Seizures occurred most commonly in \nelderly patients and those with pre-existing central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g. brain lesions \nor history of seizures) and/or compromised renal function. Similar observations have been made in the \npost-marketing environment.\n\nConcomitant use with valproic acid \nThe concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/sodium valproate is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5).\n\nSub-optimal exposure\nBased on the data available it cannot be excluded that in the few cases of surgical interventions \nexceeding 4 hours, patients could be exposed to sub-optimal ertapenem concentrations and \nconsequently to a risk of potential treatment failure. Therefore, caution should be exercised in such \nunusual cases.\n\nExcipient\nThis medicinal product contains approximately 6.0 mEq (approximately 137 mg) of sodium per 1.0 g \ndose which should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\nConsiderations for use in particular populations\nExperience in the use of ertapenem in the treatment of severe infections is limited. In clinical studies \nfor the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, in adults, 25 % of evaluable patients treated with \nertapenem had severe disease (defined as pneumonia severity index > III). In a clinical study for the \ntreatment of acute gynaecologic infections, in adults, 26 % of evaluable patients treated with \nertapenem had severe disease (defined as temperature \u2265 39\uf0b0C and/or bacteraemia); ten patients had \nbacteraemia. Of evaluable patients treated with ertapenem in a clinical study for the treatment of \nintra-abdominal infections, in adults, 30 % had generalised peritonitis and 39 % had infections \ninvolving sites other than the appendix including the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon, and \ngallbladder; there were limited numbers of evaluable patients who were enrolled with APACHE II \nscores \u2265 15 and efficacy in these patients has not been established.\n\nThe efficacy of INVANZ in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-\nresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has not been established. \n\nEfficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of diabetic foot infections with concurrent osteomyelitis has not \nbeen established.\n\nThere is relatively little experience with ertapenem in children less than two years of age. In this age \ngroup, particular care should be taken to establish the susceptibility of the infecting organism(s) to \nertapenem. No data are available in children under 3 months of age.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteractions caused by inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated clearance or CYP-mediated clearance of \nmedicinal products are unlikely (see section 5.2).\n\nDecreases in valproic acid levels that may fall below the therapeutic range have been reported when \nvalproic acid was co-administered with carbapenem agents. The lowered valproic acid levels can lead \nto inadequate seizure control; therefore, concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/sodium \nvalproate is not recommended and alternative antibacterial or anti-convulsant therapies should be \nconsidered.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\nAdequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in pregnant women. Animal studies do \nnot indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-foetal development, \nparturition or post-natal development. However, ertapenem should not be used during pregnancy \nunless the potential benefit outweighs the possible risk to the foetus.\n\nBreast-feeding\nErtapenem is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions on the infant, \nmothers should not breast-feed their infants while receiving ertapenem.\n\nFertility\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies regarding the effect of ertapenem use on fertility in \nmen and women. Preclinical studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nfertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\n\nINVANZ may influence patients' ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that \ndizziness and somnolence have been reported with INVANZ (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nAdults\nThe total number of patients treated with ertapenem in clinical studies was over 2,200 of which over \n2,150 received a 1 g dose of ertapenem. Adverse reactions (i.e., considered by the investigator to be \npossibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported in approximately \n20 % of patients treated with ertapenem. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 1.3 % \nof patients. An additional 476 patients received ertapenem as a single 1 g dose prior to surgery in a \nclinical study for the prophylaxis of surgical site infections following colorectal surgery.\n\nFor patients who received only INVANZ, the most common adverse reactions reported during therapy \nplus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped were: diarrhoea (4.8 %), infused vein \ncomplication (4.5 %) and nausea (2.8 %).\n\nFor patients who received only INVANZ, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities and \ntheir respective incidence rates during therapy plus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped \nwere: elevations in ALT (4.6 %), AST (4.6 %), alkaline phosphatase (3.8 %) and platelet count \n(3.0 %). \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nPaediatric population (3 months to 17 years of age):\nThe total number of patients treated with ertapenem in clinical studies was 384. The overall safety \nprofile is comparable to that in adult patients. Adverse reactions (i.e., considered by the investigator to \nbe possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported in approximately \n20.8 % of patients treated with ertapenem. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in \n0.5 % of patients.\n\nFor patients who received only INVANZ, the most common adverse reactions reported during therapy \nplus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped were: diarrhoea (5.2 %) and infusion site pain \n(6.1 %).\n\nFor patients who received only INVANZ, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities and \ntheir respective incidence rates during therapy plus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped \nwere: decreases in neutrophil count (3.0 %), and elevations in ALT (2.9 %) and AST (2.8 %).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nFor patients who received only INVANZ, the following adverse reactions were reported during \ntherapy plus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped:\n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10);

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with ertapenem. Overdosing of \nertapenem is unlikely. Intravenous administration of ertapenem at a 3 g daily dose for 8 days to \nhealthy adult volunteers did not result in significant toxicity. In clinical studies in adults inadvertent \nadministration of up to 3 g in a day did not result in clinically important adverse reactions. In \npaediatric clinical studies, a single intravenous (IV) dose of 40 mg/kg up to a maximum of 2 g did not \nresult in toxicity.\n\nHowever, in the event of an overdose, treatment with INVANZ should be discontinued and general \nsupportive treatment given until renal elimination takes place.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nErtapenem can be removed to some extent by haemodialysis (see section 5.2); however, no \ninformation is available on the use of haemodialysis to treat overdose.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nGeneral properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, carbapenems, ATC code: J01DH03\n\nMechanism of action\nErtapenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis following attachment to penicillin binding proteins \n(PBPs). In Escherichia coli, affinity is strongest to PBPs 2 and 3.\n\nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship\nSimilar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that the plasma concentration of ertapenem \nexceeds the MIC of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in \npre-clinical PK/PD studies.\n\nMechanism of resistance\nFor species considered susceptible to ertapenem, resistance was uncommon in surveillance studies in \nEurope. In resistant isolates, resistance to other antibacterial agents of the carbapenem class was seen \nin some but not all isolates. Ertapenem is effectively stable to hydrolysis by most classes of beta-\nlactamases, including penicillinases, cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases, but \nnot metallo-beta-lactamases.\n\nMethicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci are resistant to ertapenem, owing to PBP target \ninsensitivity; P. aeruginosa and other non-fermentative bacteria are generally resistant, probably \nowing to limited penetration and to active efflux.\n\nResistance is uncommon in Enterobacteriaceae and ertapenem is generally active against those with \nextended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance can however be observed when ESBLs or \nother potent beta-lactamases (e.g. AmpC types) are present in conjunction with reduced permeability, \narising by the loss of one or more outer membrane porins, or with up-regulated efflux. Resistance can \nalso arise via the acquisition of beta-lactamases with significant carbapenem-hydrolysing activity (e.g. \nIMP and VIM metallo-beta-lactamases or KPC types), though these are rare.\n\nThe mechanism of action of ertapenem differs from that of other classes of antibiotics, such as \nquinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracyclines. There is no target-based cross-resistance \nbetween ertapenem and these substances. However, micro-organisms may exhibit resistance to more \nthan one class of antibacterial agents when the mechanism is, or includes, impermeability to some \ncompounds and/or an efflux pump.\n\nBreakpoints\n\nThe EUCAST MIC breakpoints are as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 Enterobacterales: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Streptococcus pneumoniae: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Haemophilus influenzae: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 M. catarrhalis: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Gram negative anaerobes: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Gram positive anaerobes: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Viridans group streptococci: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\uf0b7 Non species related breakpoints: S \u2264 0.5 mg/L and R > 0.5 mg/L\n\n \n\n\n\n10\n\n(NB: Susceptibility of staphylococci to ertapenem is inferred from methicillin susceptibility and \nsusceptibility of group A, B, C,& G streptococci is inferred from benzylpenicillin susceptibility) \n\nThe prescribers are informed that local MIC breakpoints, if available, should be consulted.\n\nMicrobiological susceptibility\nThe prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species and \nlocal information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. Localised \nclusters of infections due to carbapenem-resistant organisms have been reported in the European \nUnion. The information below gives only approximate guidance on the probability as to whether the \nmicro-organism will be susceptible to ertapenem or not. \n\nCommonly susceptible species:\nGram-positive aerobes:\nMethicillin-susceptible-staphylococci (including Staphylococcus aureus)*\nStreptococcus agalactiae*\nStreptococcus pneumoniae*\u2020\n\nStreptococcus pyogenes\nGram-negative aerobes:\nCitrobacter freundii\nEnterobacter aerogenes\nEnterobacter cloacae\nEscherichia coli*\nHaemophilus influenzae*\nHaemophilus parainfluenzae\nKlebsiella oxytoca\nKlebsiella pneumoniae*\nMoraxella catarrhalis*\nMorganella morganii\nProteus mirabilis*\nProteus vulgaris\nSerratia marcescens\nAnaerobes:\nClostridium species (excluding C. difficile)*\nEubacterium species*\nFusobacterium species*\nPeptostreptococcus species*\nPorphyromonas asaccharolytica*\nPrevotella species*\nSpecies for which acquired resistance may be a problem:\nGram-positive aerobes:\nMethicillin-resistant staphylococci +#\n\nAnaerobes:\nBacteroides fragilis and species in the B. fragilis Group*\nInherently resistant organisms:\nGram-positive aerobes:\nCorynebacterium

aeruginosa\nStenotrophomonas maltophilia\nAnaerobes:\nLactobacillus species\n\n \n\n\n\n11\n\nOthers:\nChlamydia species\nMycoplasma species\nRickettsia species\nLegionella species\n* Activity has been satisfactorily demonstrated in clinical studies.\n\u2020 The efficacy of INVANZ in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant \n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae has not been established.\n+ frequency of acquired resistance > 50 % in some Member States.\n# Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (including MRSA) are always resistant to beta-lactams.\n\nInformation from clinical studies\n\nEfficacy in Paediatric Studies\nErtapenem was evaluated primarily for paediatric safety and secondarily for efficacy in randomised \ncomparative, multicentre studies in patients 3 months to 17 years of age. \n\nThe proportion of patients with a favourable clinical response assessment at posttreatment visit in the \nclinical MITT population is shown below:\n\nDisease

1 patient with IAI in the ticarcillin/clavulanate group with secondary bacteraemia at entry into \nthe study.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nPlasma concentrations\nAverage plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a \n1 g dose in healthy young adults (25 to 45 years of age) were 155 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hour \npostdose (end of infusion), 9 micrograms/mL at 12 hour postdose, and 1 microgram/mL at 24 hour \npostdose. \n\nArea under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of ertapenem in adults increases nearly dose-\nproportionally over the 0.5 to 2 g dose range.\n\nThere is no accumulation of ertapenem in adults following multiple intravenous doses ranging from \n0.5 to 2 g daily.\n\nAverage plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a \n15 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 3 to 23 months of age were \n103.8 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 13.5 micrograms/mL at 6 hour \npostdose, and 2.5 micrograms/mL at 12 hour postdose. \n\nAverage plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a \n15 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 2 to 12 years of age were \n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\n113.2 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 12.8 micrograms/mL at 6 hour \npostdose, and 3.0 micrograms/mL at 12 hour postdose.\n\nAverage plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a \n20 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) dose in patients 13 to 17 years of age were \n170.4 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose (end of infusion), 7.0 micrograms/mL at 12 hour \npostdose, and 1.1 microgram/mL at 24 hour postdose. \n\nAverage plasma concentrations of ertapenem following a single 30 minute intravenous infusion of a \n1 g dose in three patients 13 to 17 years of age were 155.9 micrograms/mL (Cmax) at 0.5 hour postdose \n(end of infusion), and 6.2 micrograms/mL at 12 hour postdose.\n\nDistribution\nErtapenem is highly bound to human plasma proteins. In healthy young adults (25 to 45 years of age), \nthe protein binding of ertapenem decreases, as plasma concentrations increase, from approximately \n95 % bound at an approximate plasma concentration of < 50 micrograms/mL to approximately 92 % \nbound at an approximate plasma concentration of 155 micrograms/mL (average concentration \nachieved at the end of infusion following 1 g intravenously).\n\nThe volume of distribution (Vdss) of ertapenem in adults is approximately 8 litres (0.11 litre/kg) and \napproximately 0.2 litre/kg in paediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age and approximately \n0.16 litre/kg in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age.\n\nConcentrations of ertapenem achieved in adult skin blister fluid at each sampling point on the third \nday of 1 g once daily intravenous doses showed a ratio of AUC in skin blister fluid: AUC in plasma \nof 0.61.\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that the effect of ertapenem on the plasma protein binding of highly protein \nbound medicinal products (warfarin, ethinyl estradiol, and norethindrone) was small. The change in \nbinding was < 12 % at peak plasma ertapenem concentration following a 1 g dose. In vivo, probenecid \n(500 mg every 6 hours) decreased the bound fraction of ertapenem in plasma at the end of infusion in \nsubjects administered a single 1 g intravenous dose from approximately 91 % to approximately 87 %. \nThe effects of this change are anticipated to be transient. A clinically significant interaction due to \nertapenem displacing another medicinal product or another medicinal product displacing ertapenem is \nunlikely.\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin \nor vinblastine and that ertapenem is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn healthy young adults (23 to 49 years of age), after intravenous infusion of radiolabelled 1 g \nertapenem, the plasma radioactivity consists predominantly (94 %) of ertapenem. The major \nmetabolite of ertapenem is the ring-opened derivative formed by dehydropeptidase-I-mediated \nhydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring.\n\nIn vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit metabolism \nmediated by any of the six major CYP isoforms: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4.\n\nElimination\nFollowing administration of a 1 g radiolabelled intravenous dose of ertapenem to healthy young adults \n(23 to 49 years of age), approximately 80 % is recovered in urine and 10 % in faeces. Of the 80 % \nrecovered in urine, approximately 38 % is excreted as unchanged ertapenem and approximately 37 % \nas the ring-opened metabolite.\n\nIn healthy young adults (18 to 49 years of age) and patients 13 to 17 years of age given a 1 g \nintravenous dose, the mean plasma half-life is approximately 4 hours. The mean plasma half-life in \nchildren 3 months to 12 years of age is approximately 2.5 hours. Average concentrations of ertapenem \n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\nin urine exceed 984 micrograms/mL during the period 0 to 2 hours postdose and exceed \n52 micrograms/mL during the period 12 to 24 hours post-administration.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nGender\nThe plasma concentrations of ertapenem are comparable in men and women.\n\nElderly\nPlasma concentrations following a 1 g and 2 g intravenous dose of ertapenem are slightly higher \n(approximately 39 % and 22 %, respectively) in healthy elderly adults (\u2265 65 years) relative to young \nadults (\uf03c 65 years). In the absence of severe renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary in \nelderly patients.\n\nPaediatric population\nPlasma concentrations of ertapenem are comparable in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and \nadults following a 1 g once daily intravenous dose.\n\nFollowing the 20 mg/kg dose (up to a maximum dose of 1 g), the pharmacokinetic parameter values in \npatients 13 to 17 years of age were generally comparable to those in healthy young adults. To provide \nan estimate of the pharmacokinetic data if all patients in this age group were to receive a 1 g dose, the \npharmacokinetic data were calculated adjusting for a 1 g dose, assuming linearity. A comparison of \nresults show that a 1 g once daily dose of ertapenem achieves a pharmacokinetic profile in patients \n13 to 17 years of age comparable to that of adults. The ratios (13 to 17 years/adults) for AUC, the end \nof infusion concentration and the concentration at the midpoint of the dosing interval were 0.99, 1.20, \nand 0.84, respectively.\n\nPlasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval following a single 15 mg/kg intravenous \ndose of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of age are comparable to plasma concentrations at \nthe midpoint of the dosing interval following a 1 g once daily intravenous dose in adults (see Plasma \nconcentrations). The plasma clearance (mL/min/kg) of ertapenem in patients 3 months to 12 years of \nage is approximately 2-fold higher as compared to that in adults. At the 15 mg/kg dose, the AUC value \nand plasma concentrations at the midpoint of the dosing interval in patients 3 months to 12 years of \nage were comparable to those in young healthy adults receiving a 1 g intravenous dose of ertapenem.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. \nDue to the limited extent of hepatic metabolism of ertapenem, its pharmacokinetics are not expected to \nbe affected by hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with \nhepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment\nFollowing a single 1 g intravenous dose of ertapenem in adults, AUCs of total ertapenem (bound and \nunbound) and of unbound ertapenem are similar in patients with mild renal impairment (Clcr 60 to \n90 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with healthy subjects (ages 25 to 82 years). AUCs of total ertapenem \nand of unbound ertapenem are increased in patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr 31 to \n59 mL/min/1.73 m2) approximately 1.5-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared with healthy \nsubjects. AUCs of total ertapenem and of unbound ertapenem are increased in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (Clcr 5 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m\n\n2) approximately 2.6-fold and 3.4-fold, respectively, \ncompared with healthy subjects. AUCs of total ertapenem and of unbound ertapenem are increased in \npatients who require haemodialysis approximately 2.9-fold and 6.0-fold, respectively, between dialysis \nsessions, compared with healthy subjects. Following a single 1 g intravenous dose given immediately \nprior to a haemodialysis session, approximately 30 % of the dose is recovered in the dialysate. There \nare no data in paediatric patients with renal impairment.\n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nThere are inadequate data on the safety and efficacy of ertapenem in patients with advanced renal \nimpairment and patients who require haemodialysis to support a dose recommendation. Therefore, \nertapenem should not be used in these patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, \npharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \nDecreased neutrophil counts, however, occurred in rats that received high doses of ertapenem, which \nwas not considered a significant safety issue.\n\nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ertapenem have not been \nperformed.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What INVANZ is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you are given INVANZ\n3. How to use INVANZ\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store INVANZ\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What INVANZ is and what it is used for\n\nINVANZ contains ertapenem which is an antibiotic of the beta-lactam group. It has the ability to kill a \nwide range of bacteria (germs) that cause infections in various parts of the body. \n\nINVANZ can be given to persons 3 months of age and older.\n\nTreatment:\nYour doctor has prescribed INVANZ because you or your child has one (or more) of the following \ntypes of infection: \n\uf0b7 Infection in the abdomen\n\uf0b7 Infection affecting the lungs (pneumonia)\n\uf0b7 Gynaecological infections\n\uf0b7 Skin infections of the foot in diabetic patients.\n\nPrevention:\n\uf0b7 Prevention of surgical site infections in adults following surgery of the colon or rectum.\n\n2. What you need to know before you are given INVANZ\n\nDo not use INVANZ\n- if you are allergic to the active substance (ertapenem) or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6)\n- if you are allergic to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems (which are \n\nused to treat various infections).\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking INVANZ.\n\nDuring treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat, \ndifficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), tell your doctor straight away as you may need urgent \nmedical treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n26\n\nWhile antibiotics including INVANZ kill certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may continue to \ngrow more than normal. This is called overgrowth. Your doctor will monitor you for overgrowth and \ntreat you if necessary.\n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea before, during or after your treatment\nwith INVANZ. This is because you may have a condition known as colitis (an inflammation of the \nbowel). Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (see Other \nmedicines and INVANZ below).\n\nTell your doctor about any medical condition you have or have had including:\n- Kidney disease. It is particularly important that your doctor knows if you have kidney disease \n\nand whether you undergo dialysis treatment.\n- Allergies to any medicines, including antibiotics.\n- Central nervous system disorders, such as localised tremors, or seizures.\n\nChildren and adolescents (3 months to 17 years of age)\nExperience with INVANZ is limited in children less than two years of age. In this age group your \ndoctor will decide on the potential benefit of its use. There is no experience in children under 3 months \nof age.\n\nOther medicines and INVANZ\nAlways tell your doctor about all medicines that you are taking or plan to take, including those \nobtained without a prescription.\n\nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium \nvalproate (used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraines, or schizophrenia). This is because\nINVANZ can affect the way some other medicines work. Your doctor will decide whether you should \nuse INVANZ in combination with these other medicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant before \nreceiving INVANZ.\n\nINVANZ has not been studied in pregnant women. INVANZ should not be used during pregnancy \nunless your doctor decides the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you intend to breast-feed before \nreceiving INVANZ.\n\nWomen who are receiving INVANZ should not breast-feed, because it has been found in human milk \nand the breast-fed baby may therefore be affected.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how you react to the medicine.\nCertain side effects, such as dizziness and sleepiness, have been reported with INVANZ, which may \naffect some patients\u2019 ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\nINVANZ contains sodium\nThis medicine contains approximately 6.0 mEq (approximately 137 mg) of sodium per 1.0 g dose \nwhich should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.\n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\n3. How to use INVANZ\n\nINVANZ will always be prepared and given to you intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or another \nhealthcare professional.\n\nThe recommended dose of INVANZ for adults and adolescents 13 years of age and older is 1 gram (g) \ngiven once a day. The recommended dose for children 3 months to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg given \ntwice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day). Your doctor will decide how many days\u2019 treatment you need.\n\nFor prevention of surgical site infections following surgery of the colon or rectum, the recommended \ndose of INVANZ is 1 g administered as a single intravenous dose 1 hour before surgery.\n\nIt is very important that you continue to receive INVANZ for as long as your doctor prescribes it.\n\nIf you are given more INVANZ than you should\n\nIf you are concerned that you may have been given too much INVANZ, contact your doctor or another \nhealthcare professional immediately.\n\nIf you miss a dose of INVANZ\n\nIf you are concerned that you may have missed a dose, contact your doctor or another healthcare \nprofessional immediately.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nAdults 18 years of age and older:\n\nSince the drug has been marketed, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), hypersensitivity syndromes \n(allergic reactions including rash, fever, abnormal blood tests) have been reported. The first signs of a \nsevere allergic reaction may include swelling of the face and/or throat. If these symptoms occur tell \nyour doctor straight away as you may need urgent medical treatment.\n\nThe most common (more than 1 in 100 patients and less than 1 in 10 patients) side effects are:\n\uf0b7 Headache\n\uf0b7 Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting\n\uf0b7 Rash, itching\n\uf0b7 Problems with the vein into which the medicine is given (including inflammation, formation of \n\na lump, swelling at the injection site, or leaking of fluid into the tissue and skin around the \ninjection site)\n\n\uf0b7 Increase in platelet count\n\uf0b7 Changes in liver function tests\n\nLess common (more than 1 in 1,000 patients and less than 1 in 100 patients) side effects are:\n\uf0b7 Dizziness, sleepiness, sleeplessness, confusion, seizure\n\uf0b7 Low blood pressure, slow heart rate\n\uf0b7 Shortness of breath, sore throat\n\uf0b7 Constipation, yeast infection of the mouth, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, acid regurgitation, \n\ndry mouth, indigestion, loss of appetite\n\uf0b7 Skin redness\n\uf0b7 Vaginal discharge and irritation\n\uf0b7 Abdominal pain, fatigue, fungal infection, fever, oedema/swelling, chest pain, abnormal taste\n\uf0b7 Changes in some laboratory blood and urine tests\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nSide effects reported rarely (more than 1 in 10,000 patients and less than 1 in 1,000 patients) are:\n\uf0b7 Decrease in white blood cells, decrease in blood platelet count\n\uf0b7 Low blood sugar\n\uf0b7 Agitation, anxiety, depression, tremor\n\uf0b7 Irregular heart rate, increased blood pressure, bleeding, fast heart rate\n\uf0b7 Nasal congestion, cough, bleeding from the nose, pneumonia, abnormal breathing sounds, \n\nwheezing\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of the gall bladder, difficulty in swallowing, faecal incontinence, jaundice, liver \n\ndisorder\n\uf0b7 Inflammation of the skin, fungal infection of the skin, skin peeling, infection of the wound after \n\nan operation \n\uf0b7 Muscle cramp, shoulder pain\n\uf0b7 Urinary tract infection, kidney impairment\n\uf0b7 Miscarriage, genital bleeding\n\uf0b7 Allergy, feeling unwell, pelvic peritonitis, changes to the white part of the eye, fainting.\n\nSide effects reported (frequency not known) since the drug has been marketed are: \n\uf0b7 hallucinations\n\uf0b7 decreased consciousness\n\uf0b7 altered mental status (including aggression, delirium, disorientation, mental status changes) \n\uf0b7 abnormal movements \n\uf0b7 muscle weakness\n\uf0b7 unsteady walking\n\uf0b7 teeth staining\n\nThere have also been reports of changes in some laboratory blood tests.\n\nIf you experience raised or fluid-filled skin spots over a large area of your body, tell your doctor or \nnurse straight away.\n\nChildren and adolescents (3 months to 17 years of age):\n\nThe most common (more than 1 in 100 patients and less than 1 in 10 patients) side effects are:\n\uf0b7 Diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 Diaper rash\n\uf0b7 Pain at the infusion site\n\uf0b7 Changes in white blood cell count\n\uf0b7 Changes in liver function tests\n\nLess common (more than 1 in 1,000 patients and less than 1 in 100 patients) side effects are:\n\uf0b7 Headache\n\uf0b7 Hot flush, high blood pressure, red or purple, flat, pinhead spots under the skin\n\uf0b7 Discoloured faeces, black tar-like faeces\n\uf0b7 Skin redness, skin rash\n\uf0b7 Burning, itching, redness and warmth at infusion site, redness at injection site\n\uf0b7 Increase in platelet count \n\uf0b7 Changes in some laboratory blood tests\n\nSide effects reported (frequency not known) since the drug has been marketed are:\n\uf0b7 Hallucinations\n\uf0b7 Altered mental status (including aggression) \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) - if you are allergic to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems (which are used to treat various infections). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before taking invanz. during treatment, if you experience an allergic reaction (such as swelling of the face, tongue or throat, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, skin rash), tell your doctor straight away as you may need urgent medical treatment. while antibiotics including invanz kill certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may continue to grow more than normal. this is called overgrowth. your doctor will monitor you for overgrowth and treat you if necessary. it is important that you tell your doctor if you have diarrhoea before, during or after your treatment with invanz. this is because you may have a condition known as colitis (an inflammation of the bowel). do not take any medicine to treat diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor. tell your doctor if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (see other medicines and invanz below). tell your doctor about any medical condition you have or have had including: - kidney disease. it is particularly important that your doctor knows if you have kidney disease and whether you undergo dialysis treatment. - allergies to any medicines, including antibiotics. - central nervous system disorders, such as localised tremors, or seizures. children and adolescents (3 months to 17 years of age) experience with invanz is limited in children less than two years of age. in this age group your doctor will decide on the potential benefit of its use. there is no experience in children under 3 months of age. other medicines and invanz always tell your doctor about all medicines that you are taking or plan to take, including those obtained without a prescription. tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking medicines called valproic acid or sodium valproate (used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraines, or schizophrenia). this is because invanz can affect the way some other medicines work. your doctor will decide whether you should use invanz in combination with these other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding it is important that you tell your doctor if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant before receiving invanz. invanz has not been studied in pregnant women. invanz should not be used during pregnancy unless your doctor decides the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. it is important that you tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or if you intend to breast-feed before receiving invanz. women who are receiving invanz should not breast-feed, because it has been found in human milk and the breast-fed baby may therefore be affected. driving and using machines do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how you react to the medicine. certain side effects, such as dizziness and sleepiness, have been reported with invanz, which may affect some patients' ability to drive or operate machinery. invanz contains sodium this medicine contains approximately 6.0 meq (approximately 137 mg) of sodium per 1.0 g dose which should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.",
