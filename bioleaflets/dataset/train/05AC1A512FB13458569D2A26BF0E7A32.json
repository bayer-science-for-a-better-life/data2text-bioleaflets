QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOlumiant 2 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 2 mg baricitinib. \n \nOlumiant 4 mg film-coated tablets \nEach film-coated tablet contains 4 mg baricitinib. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).  \n \nOlumiant 2 mg film-coated tablets \nLight pink, 9.0 x 7.5 mm oblong tablets, debossed with \u201cLilly\u201d on one side and \u201c2\u201d on the other.  \n \nOlumiant 4 mg film-coated tablets \nMedium pink, 8.5 mm round tablets, debossed with \u201cLilly\u201d on one side and \u201c4\u201d on the other. \n \nThe tablets contain a recessed area on each side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nOlumiant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult \npatients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying \nanti-rheumatic drugs. Olumiant may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (see \nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid \narthritis. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose of Olumiant is 4 mg once daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is appropriate for \npatients such as those aged \u2265 75 years and may be appropriate for patients with a history of chronic or \nrecurrent infections. A dose of 2 mg once daily may also be considered for patients who have achieved \nsustained control of disease activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for dose tapering (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nTreatment should not be initiated in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than \n0.5 x 109 cells/L, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1 x 109 cells/L, or who have a \nhaemoglobin value less than 8 g/dL. Treatment may be initiated once values have improved above \nthese limits (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment  \nThe recommended dose is 2 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and \n60 mL/min. Olumiant is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min \n(see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Olumiant is not \nrecommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nCo-administration with OAT3 inhibitors \nThe recommended dose is 2 mg once daily in patients taking Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) \ninhibitors with a strong inhibition potential, such as probenecid (see section 4.5).  \n \nElderly \nClinical experience in patients \u2265 75 years is very limited and in these patients a starting dose of 2 mg \nis appropriate. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Olumiant in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. \nOlumiant is to be taken once daily with or without food and may be taken at any time of the day.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nPregnancy (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nInfections \n \nBaricitinib is associated with an increased rate of infections such as upper respiratory tract infections \ncompared to placebo (see section 4.8). In treatment na\u00efve patients, combination with methotrexate \nresulted in increased frequency of infections compared to baricitinib monotherapy. The risks and \nbenefits of treatment with Olumiant should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in \npatients with active, chronic or recurrent infections (see section 4.2). If an infection develops, the \npatient should be monitored carefully and Olumiant therapy should be temporarily interrupted  if the \npatient is not responding to standard therapy. Olumiant treatment should not be resumed until the \ninfection resolves.  \n \nTuberculosis \nPatients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) before starting Olumiant therapy. Olumiant should \nnot be given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiation of \nOlumiant in patients with previously untreated latent TB. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHaematological abnormalities \n \nAbsolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) < 1 x 109 cells/L, Absolute Lymphocyte Count \n(ALC) < 0.5 x 109 cells/L and haemoglobin < 8 g/dL were reported in less than 1 % of patients in \nclinical trials. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with \nan ANC < 1 x 109 cells/L, ALC < 0.5 x 109 cells/L or haemoglobin < 8 g/dL observed during routine \npatient management (see section 4.2).  \n \nThe risk of lymphocytosis is increased in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Rare cases of \nlymphoproliferative disorders have been reported. \n \nViral reactivation \n \nViral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster, herpes simplex), \nwere reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Herpes zoster was reported more commonly in \npatients \u2265 65 years of age who had previously been treated with both biologic and conventional \nDMARDs. If a patient develops herpes zoster, Olumiant treatment should be temporarily interrupted \nuntil the episode resolves. \n \nScreening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting \ntherapy with Olumiant. Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from \nclinical trials. Patients, who were positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus \nRNA, were allowed to participate. Patients with hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core \nantibody, without hepatitis B surface antigen, were also allowed to participate; such patients should be \nmonitored for expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. If HBV DNA is detected, a liver specialist \nshould be consulted to determine if treatment interruption is warranted. \n \nVaccination \n \nNo data are available on the response to vaccination with live vaccines in patients receiving \nbaricitinib. Use with live, attenuated vaccines during, or immediately prior to, Olumiant therapy is not \nrecommended.  Prior to initiating Olumiant, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date \nwith all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines. \n \nLipids \n \nDose dependent increases in blood lipid parameters were reported in patients treated with baricitinib \ncompared to placebo (see section 4.8). Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels \nin response to statin therapy. Lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 12 weeks following \ninitiation of Olumiant therapy and thereafter patients should be managed according to international \nclinical guidelines for hyperlipidaemia. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on \ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.  \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \n \nIncreases in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) to \u2265 5 and \u2265 10 x upper \nlimit of normal (ULN) were reported in less than 1 % of patients in clinical trials. In treatment-na\u00efve \npatients, combination with methotrexate resulted in increased frequency of hepatic transaminase \nelevations compared with baricitinib monotherapy (see section 4.8). If increases in ALT or AST are \nobserved during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, Olumiant \nshould be temporarily interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded. \n \nMalignancy \n \nThe risk of malignancies including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies including lymphoma. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancies following exposure \nto baricitinib. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing. \n \nVenous Thromboembolism \n \nEvents of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in \npatients receiving baricitinib. Olumiant should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for \nDVT/PE, such as older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, or patients undergoing surgery and \nimmobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, Olumiant treatment should be discontinued and \npatients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment. \n \nLaboratory monitoring \n \nTable 1. Laboratory measures and monitoring guidance  \n \n\nLaboratory Measure Action Monitoring Guidance \n\nLipid parameters \nPatients should be managed according \nto international clinical guidelines for \nhyperlipidaemia \n\n12 weeks after initiation of treatment \nand thereafter according to \ninternational clinical guidelines for \nhyperlipidaemia \n\nAbsolute Neutrophil \nCount (ANC) \n\nTreatment should be interrupted if ANC \n< 1 x 109 cells/L and may be restarted \nonce ANC return above this value \n\nBefore treatment initiation and \nthereafter according to routine patient \nmanagement  \n\nAbsolute Lymphocyte \nCount (ALC) \n\nTreatment should be interrupted if ALC \n< 0.5 x 109 cells/L and may be restarted \nonce ALC return above this value \n\nHaemoglobin (Hb) \nTreatment should be interrupted if Hb \n< 8 g/dL and may be restarted once Hb \nreturn above this value \n\nHepatic transaminases \nTreatment should be temporarily \ninterrupted if drug-induced liver injury \nis suspected \n\n \nImmunosuppressive medicinal products \n \nCombination with biologic DMARDs or other Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors is not recommended, as a \nrisk of additive immunosuppression cannot be excluded. Data concerning use of baricitinib with potent \nimmunosuppressive medicinal products (e.g., azathioprine, tacrolimus, ciclosporin) are limited and \ncaution should be exercised when using such combinations (see section 4.5). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nIn post-marketing experience, cases of drug hypersensitivity associated with baricitinib administration \nhave been reported. If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, baricitinib should be \ndiscontinued immediately.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nImmunosuppressive medicinal products \nCombination with biologic DMARDs or other JAK inhibitors has not been studied. Use of baricitinib \nwith potent immunosuppressive medicinal products such as azathioprine, tacrolimus, or ciclosporin \n\n\n\n6 \n\nwas limited in clinical studies of baricitinib, and a risk of additive immunosuppression cannot be \nexcluded (see section 4.4). \n \nPotential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of baricitinib \n \nTransporters \nIn vitro, baricitinib is a substrate for organic anionic transporter (OAT)3, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), breast \ncancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)2-K. In a clinical \npharmacology study, dosing of probenecid (an OAT3 inhibitor with strong inhibition potential) \nresulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in AUC(0-\u221e) with no change in tmax or Cmax of baricitinib. \nConsequently, the recommended dose in patients taking OAT3 inhibitors with a strong inhibition \npotential, such as probenecid, is 2 mg once daily (see section 4.2). No clinical pharmacology study has \nbeen conducted with OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential. The prodrug leflunomide rapidly \nconverts to teriflunomide which is a weak OAT3 inhibitor and therefore may lead to an increase in \nbaricitinib exposure. Since dedicated interaction studies have not been conducted, caution should be \nused when leflunomide or teriflunomide are given concomitantly with baricitinib. Concomitant use of \nthe OAT3 inhibitors ibuprofen and diclofenac may lead to increased exposure of baricitinib, however \ntheir inhibition potential of OAT3 is less compared to probenecid and thus a clinically relevant \ninteraction is not expected. Coadministration of baricitinib with ciclosporin (Pgp/BCRP inhibitor) or \nmethotrexate (substrate of several transporters including OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, BCRP, MRP2, \nMRP3, and MRP4) resulted in no clinically meaningful effects on baricitinib exposure.  \n \nCytochrome P450 enzymes \nIn vitro, baricitinib is a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP)3A4 substrate although less than 10 % of the \ndose is metabolised via oxidation. In clinical pharmacology studies, coadministration of baricitinib \nwith ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) resulted in no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of \nbaricitinib. Coadministration of baricitinib with fluconazole (moderate CYP3A/CYP2C19/CYP2C9 \ninhibitor) or rifampicin (strong CYP3A inducer) resulted in no clinically meaningful changes to \nbaricitinib exposure. \n \nGastric pH modifying agents \nElevating gastric pH with omeprazole had no clinically significant effect on baricitinib exposure.  \n \nPotential for baricitinib to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \n \nTransporters \nIn vitro, baricitinib is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, organic cationic transporter  (OCT) 2, \nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. \nBaricitinib may be a clinically relevant inhibitor of OCT1, however there are currently no known \nselective OCT1 substrates for which clinically significant interactions might be predicted. In clinical \npharmacology studies there were no clinically meaningful effects on exposure when baricitinib was \ncoadministered with digoxin (Pgp substrate) or methotrexate (substrate of several transporters). \n \nCytochrome P450 enzymes \nIn clinical pharmacology studies, coadministration of baricitinib with the CYP3A substrates \nsimvastatin, ethinyl oestradiol, or levonorgestrel resulted in no clinically meaningful changes in the \nPK of these medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe JAK/STAT pathway has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion and cell polarity which can \naffect early embryonic development. There are no adequate data from the use of baricitinib in pregnant \nwomen. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Baricitinib was \n\n\n\n7 \n\nteratogenic in rats and rabbits. Animal studies indicate that baricitinib may have an adverse effect on \nbone development in utero at higher dosages. \n \nOlumiant is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential have \nto use effective contraception during and for at least 1 week after treatment. If a patient becomes \npregnant while taking Olumiant the parents should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether baricitinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of baricitinib in milk (see \nsection 5.3). \n \nA risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded and Olumiant should not be used during breast-feeding. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Olumiant therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nStudies in animals suggest that treatment with baricitinib has the potential to decrease female fertility \nwhile on treatment, but there was no effect on male spermatogenesis (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOlumiant has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring in \u2265 2 % of patients treated \nwith Olumiant monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs were increased \nLDL cholesterol (33.6 %), upper respiratory tract infections (14.7 %) and nausea (2.8 %). Infections \nreported with Olumiant treatment included Herpes zoster. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 3,464 patients were treated with Olumiant in clinical studies in rheumatoid arthritis \nrepresenting 4214 patient-years of exposure. Of these, 2166 rheumatoid arthritis patients were exposed \nto Olumiant for at least one year. Six placebo-controlled studies were integrated (997 patients on 4 mg \nonce daily and 1070 patients on placebo) to evaluate the safety of Olumiant in comparison to placebo \nfor up to 16 weeks after treatment initiation.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2.

Nausea was most frequent during the first 2 weeks of treatment. \n \nInfections \nIn controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, the incidence rate of all infections (rate of patients with \n\u2265 1 event per 100 patient-years of exposure) was 101 with Olumiant compared to 83 in the placebo \ngroup. Most infections were mild to moderate in severity. In studies which included both doses, \ninfections were reported in 31.9%, 28.8% and 24.1% of patients up to 16 weeks in the 4 mg, 2 mg and \nplacebo groups, respectively. Reporting rates for Olumiant compared to placebo for the \ninfection-related ADRs were: Upper respiratory tract infections (14.7 % vs. 11.7 %), urinary tract \ninfections (3.4 % vs. 2.7 %), gastroenteritis (1.6 % vs. 0.8 %), herpes simplex (1.8 % vs. 0.7 %), and \n\n\n\n9 \n\nherpes zoster (1.4 % vs. 0.4 %). In treatment-na\u00efve patients, for up to 52 weeks, the frequency of upper \nrespiratory tract infections was greater for the combination treatment of methotrexate and Olumiant \n(26.0 %) compared to methotrexate alone (22.9 %) or Olumiant alone (22.0 %). The rate of serious \ninfections with Olumiant (1.1 %) was similar to placebo (1.2 %). For Olumiant, the most common \nserious infections were herpes zoster, and cellulitis. The rate of serious infections remained stable \nduring long term exposure. The overall incidence rate of serious infections in the clinical trial \nprogramme was 3.2 per 100 patient-years. \n \nHepatic transaminase elevations \nIn controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase \n(AST) elevations \u2265 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 1.4 % and 0.8 % of patients \ntreated with Olumiant, compared to 1.0 % and 0.8 % respectively of patients treated with placebo. \nMost cases of hepatic transaminase elevations were asymptomatic and transient. \n \nIn treatment-na\u00efve patients, the combination of Olumiant with potentially hepatotoxic medicinal \nproducts, such as methotrexate, resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. For up to \n52 weeks, the frequency of ALT and AST elevations \u2265 3 x ULN were greater for the combination \ntreatment of methotrexate and Olumiant (7.5 % and 3.8 %) compared to methotrexate alone (2.9 % \nand 0.5 %) or Olumiant alone (1.9 % and 1.3 %).  \n \nThe pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST remained stable over time including in the long-\nterm extension study. \n \nLipid elevations  \nBaricitinib treatment was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters including total \ncholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. There was no change in the \nLDL/HDL ratio. Elevations were observed at 12 weeks and remained stable thereafter at a higher \nvalue than baseline including in the long-term extension study. In controlled studies, for up to \n16 weeks, the following rates were observed for Olumiant vs. placebo: \n \n\n\u2022 Increased total cholesterol \u2265 5.17 mmol/L: 49.1 % vs.15.8 %, respectively  \n\u2022 Increased LDL cholesterol \u2265 3.36 mmol/L: 33.6 % vs. 10.3 %, respectively  \n\u2022 Increased HDL cholesterol \u2265 1.55 mmol/L: 42.7 % vs. 13.8 %, respectively  \n\u2022 Increased triglycerides \u2265 5.65 mmol/L: 0.4 % vs. 0.5 %, respectively  \n\n \nIn studies which included both doses, a dose-relationship was observed with increased total cholesterol \n\u2265 5.17 mmol/L reported in 48.8 %, 34.7 % and 17.8 % of patients up to 16 weeks in the 4 mg, 2 mg \nand placebo groups, respectively. \n \nElevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy. \n \nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) \nIn controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, increases in CPK values were common. Significant increases \n(> 5 x ULN) occurred in 0.8 % of patients treated with Olumiant and 0.3 % of patients treated with \nplacebo. A dose relationship was observed with CPK elevations \u2265 5 x ULN of normal reported in \n1.5 %, 0.8 % and 0.6 % of patients at 16 weeks in the 4 mg, 2 mg and placebo groups, respectively. \nMost cases were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation. In clinical trials, there were \nno confirmed cases of rhabdomyolysis. Elevations of CPK were observed at 4 weeks and remained \nstable at a higher value than baseline thereafter including in the long-term extension study. \n \nNeutropaenia \nIn controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109 cells/L occurred \nin 0.3 % of patients treated with Olumiant compared to 0 % of patients treated with placebo. There \nwas no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophil counts and the occurrence of serious \ninfections. However, in clinical studies, treatment was interrupted in response to ANC \n\n\n\n10 \n\n< 1 x 109 cells/L. The pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained stable at a \nlower value than baseline over time including in the long-term extension study.  \n \nThrombocytosis \nIn controlled studies, for up to 16 weeks, increases in platelet counts above 600 x 109 cells/L occurred \nin 2.0 % of patients treated with Olumiant 4 mg and 1.1 % of patients treated with placebo. No \nassociation was observed between increased platelet counts and adverse events of a thrombotic nature. \nThe pattern and incidence of increases in platelet counts remained stable at a higher value than \nbaseline over time including in the long term extension study. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses up to 40 mg and multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 10 days have been administered \nin clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. Adverse events were comparable to those seen at lower \ndoses and no specific toxicities were identified. Pharmacokinetic data of a single dose of 40 mg in \nhealthy volunteers indicate that more than 90 % of the administered dose is expected to be eliminated \nwithin 24 hours. In case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of adverse reactions. Patients who develop adverse reactions should receive appropriate \ntreatment. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA37 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nBaricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. In isolated enzyme \nassays, baricitinib inhibited the activities of JAK1, JAK2, Tyrosine Kinase 2 and JAK3 with IC50 \nvalues of 5.9, 5.7, 53 and > 400 nM, respectively. \n \nJanus kinases (JAKs) are enzymes that transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a \nnumber of cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation and immune \nfunction. Within the intracellular signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal \ntransducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression within the cell. \nBaricitinib modulates these signalling pathways by partially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic \nactivity, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nInhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation \nAdministration of baricitinib resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 \nphosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects with maximal inhibition observed 2 hours after \ndosing which returned to near baseline by 24 hours.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11 \n\nImmunoglobulins \nMean serum IgG, IgM, and IgA values decreased by 12 weeks after starting treatment with Olumiant, \nand remained stable at a lower value than baseline through at least 104 weeks. For most patients, \nchanges in immunoglobulins occurred within the normal reference range. \n \nLymphocytes \nMean absolute lymphocyte count increased by 1 week after starting treatment with Olumiant, returned \nto baseline by week 24, and then remained stable through at least 104 weeks. For most patients, \nchanges in lymphocyte count occurred within the normal reference range. \n \nC-reactive protein \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed as \nearly as 1 week after starting treatment with Olumiant and were maintained throughout dosing. \n \nCreatinine \nBaricitinib induced a mean increase in serum creatinine levels of 3.8  \u00b5mol/L after two weeks of \ntreatment, as compared to placebo, which remained stable thereafter during up to 104  weeks of \ntreatment. This may be due to inhibition of creatinine secretion by baricitinib in the renal tubules. \nConsequently, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine may be slightly \nreduced, without actual loss of renal function or the occurrence of renal adverse events. \n \nVaccine study \n \nThe influence of baricitinib on the humoral response to non-live vaccines was evaluated in 106 RA \npatients under stable treatment with baricitinib 2 or 4  mg, receiving inactivated pneumococcal or tetanus \nvaccination. The majority of these patients (n  =  94) were co-treated with methotrexate. For the total \npopulation, pneumococcal vaccination resulted in a satisfactory IgG immune response in 68.0  % \n(95  % CI: 58.4  %, 76.2  %) of the patients.  In 43.1  % (95  % CI: 34.0  %, 52.8  %) of the patients, a \nsatisfactory IgG immune response to tetanus vaccination was achieved. \n \nClinical efficacy \n \nThe efficacy and safety of Olumiant once daily was assessed in 4 Phase III randomised, double-blind, \nmulticentre studies in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according \nto the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria (see Table 3). Patients over 18 years of age were eligible to \nparticipate. The presence of at least 6 tender and 6 swollen joints was required at baseline. All patients \nwho completed these studies were eligible to enrol in a long term extension study for up to 4 years \ncontinued treatment. \n \nThe RA-BEGIN Study in MTX-na\u00efve patients is supportive for the target population of patients with \nan inadequate response to, or intolerance to, other DMARDs (section 4.1). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 3.

Continued, durable response rates were observed, with ACR20/50/70 responses \nmaintained for at least 2 years including the long-term extension study. \n \nTreatment with Olumiant 4 mg, alone or in combination with cDMARDs, resulted in significant \nimprovements in all individual ACR components, including tender and swollen joint counts, patient \nand physician global assessments, HAQ-DI, pain assessment and CRP, compared to placebo or MTX \nmonotherapy. In RA-BEAM, treatment with Olumiant resulted in significant improvement in patient \nand physician global assessments, HAQ-DI, pain assessment and CRP at Weeks 12, 24 and 52 \ncompared to adalimumab.  \n \nIn placebo-controlled trials in which MTX was not required, 501 subjects randomized to baricitinib \n2 mg or 4 mg received MTX as background therapy, and 303 received conventional DMARDs other \nthan MTX (approximately half with MTX and half without). The most common concomitant \nDMARDs in these subjects were MTX (79% of patients), hydroxychloroquine (19%), leflunomide \n\n\n\n13 \n\n(11%), and sulphasalazine (9%). No relevant differences regarding efficacy and safety were observed \nin subgroups defined by types of concomitant DMARDs used in combination with baricitinib. \n \nRemission and low disease activity \nA statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with Olumiant 4 mg compared to \nplacebo or MTX achieved remission, as defined by SDAI \u2264 3.3 and CDAI \u2264 2.8, at weeks 12 and 24 \n(Table 4).  \n \nIn all 4 studies, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with Olumiant 4 mg compared to \nplacebo or MTX achieved low disease activity or remission (DAS28-ESR or DAS28-hsCRP \u2264 3.2 and \nDAS28-ESR or DAS28-hsCRP < 2.6) at Weeks 12 and 24.  \n \nGreater rates of remission compared to placebo were observed as early as week 4.

The proportion of patients achieving a clinically \nsignificant improvement (HAQ-DI \u2265 0.30) was also higher with Olumiant compared to placebo or \nMTX at week 12 (Table 4). Improvements were seen as early as Week 1 and, in studies RA-BEGIN \nand RA-BEAM, this was maintained for up to 52 weeks.  \n \nTreatment with Olumiant 4 mg, alone or in combination with cDMARDs, resulted in a significant \nimprovement in pain compared to all comparators (placebo, MTX, adalimumab), as measured on a \n0-100 visual analogue scale, at 12 weeks. Statistically significant pain reduction was seen as early as \nWeek 1 and in studies RA-BEGIN and RA-BEAM this was maintained for up to 52 weeks.  \n \nIn RA-BEAM and RA-BUILD, treatment with Olumiant 4 mg resulted in a significant improvement \nin the mean duration and severity of morning joint stiffness compared to placebo or adalimumab as \nassessed using daily electronic patient diaries for 12 weeks. \n \nIn all studies, Olumiant-treated patients reported improvements in patient-reported quality of life, as \nmeasured by the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Score and fatigue, as \nmeasured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score (FACIT-F). \n \nOlumiant 4 mg vs. 2 mg \nDifferences in efficacy between the 4 mg and the 2 mg doses were most notable in the bDMARD-IR \npopulation (RA-BEACON), in which statistically significant improvements in the ACR components of \n\n\n\n16 \n\nswollen joint count, tender joint count and ESR were shown for Olumiant 4 mg compared to placebo \nat Week 24 but not for Olumiant 2 mg compared to placebo. In addition, for both study RA-BEACON \nand RA-BUILD, onset of efficacy was faster and the effect size was generally larger for the 4 mg dose \ngroups compared to 2 mg.  \n \nIn a long-term extension study, patients from Studies RA-BEAM, RA-BUILD and RA-BEACON who \nachieved sustained low disease activity or remission (CDAI \u2264 10) after at least 15 months of treatment \nwith Olumiant 4 mg once daily were re-randomized 1:1 in a double-blind manner to continue 4 mg \nonce daily or reduce dose to 2 mg once daily. The majority of patients maintained low disease activity \nor remission based on CDAI score: \n\n\u2022 At week 12: 234/251 (93 %) continuing 4 mg vs. 207/251 (82 %) reduced to 2 mg (p \u2264 0.001) \n\u2022 At week 24: 163/191 (85 %) continuing 4 mg vs. 144/189 (76 %) reduced to 2 mg (p \u2264 0.05) \n\u2022 At week 48: 57/73 (78 %) continuing 4 mg vs. 51/86 (59 %) reduced to 2 mg (p \u2264 0.05) \n\n \nThe majority of patients who lost their low disease activity or remission status after dose reduction \ncould regain disease control after the dose was returned to 4 mg. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nOlumiant in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nFollowing oral administration of baricitinib, a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure was \nobserved in the therapeutic dose range. The PK of baricitinib is linear with respect to time. \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing oral administration, baricitinib is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of approximately \n1 hour (range 0.5 - 3.0 h) and an absolute bioavailability of approximately 79 % (CV = 3.94 %). Food \nintake led to a decreased exposure by up to 14 %, a decrease in Cmax by up to 18 % and delayed tmax by \n0.5 hours. Administration with meals was not associated with a clinically relevant effect on exposure. \n \nDistribution \n \nMean volume of distribution following intravenous infusion administration was 76 L, indicating \ndistribution of baricitinib into tissues. Baricitinib is approximately 50 % bound to plasma proteins.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBaricitinib metabolism is mediated by CYP3A4, with less than 10 % of the dose identified as \nundergoing biotransformation. No metabolites were quantifiable in plasma. In a clinical pharmacology \nstudy, baricitinib was excreted predominately as the unchanged active substance in urine (69 %) and \nfaeces (15 %) and only 4 minor oxidative metabolites were identified (3 in urine; 1 in faeces) \nconstituting approximately 5 % and 1 % of the dose, respectively. In vitro, baricitinib is a substrate for \nCYP3A4, OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K, and may be a clinically relevant inhibitor of the \ntransporter OCT1 (see section 4.5). Baricitinib is not an inhibitor of the transporters OAT1, OAT2, \nOAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant \nconcentrations.  \n \nElimination \n \nRenal elimination is the principal mechanism for baricitinib\u2019s clearance through glomerular filtration \nand active secretion via OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K. In a clinical pharmacology study, \napproximately 75 % of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine, while about 20 % of the \n\n\n\n17 \n\ndose was eliminated in the faeces. Mean apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis was 9.42 L/hr (CV = 34.3 %) and 12.5 hrs (CV = 27.4 %), respectively. Cmax and \nAUC at steady state are 1.4- and 2.0\u2013fold higher, respectively, in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis \ncompared to healthy subjects.  \n \nRenal Impairment \n \nRenal function was found to significantly affect baricitinib exposure. The mean ratios of AUC in \npatients with mild and moderate renal impairment to patients with normal renal function are 1.41 \n(90 % CI: 1.15-1.74) and 2.22 (90 % CI: 1.81-2.73), respectively. The mean ratios of Cmax in patients \nwith mild and moderate renal impairment to patients with normal renal function are 1.16 \n(90 %CI: 0.92-1.45) and 1.46 (90 %CI: 1.17-1.83), respectively. See section 4.2 for dose \nrecommendations.  \n\n \nHepatic Impairment \n \nThere was no clinically relevant effect on the PK of baricitinib in patients with mild or moderate \nhepatic impairment. The use of baricitinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nElderly \n \nAge \u2265 65 years or \u2265 75 years has no effect on baricitinib exposure (Cmax and AUC). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of baricitinib have not yet been established in a paediatric \npopulation (see section 4.2). \n \nOther intrinsic Factors \n \nBody weight, sex, race, and ethnicity did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of baricitinib. \nThe mean effects of intrinsic factors on PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) were generally within the \ninter-subject PK variability of baricitinib. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed based on these \npatient factors. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. \n \nDecreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils as well as lymphoid depletion in organs/tissues \nof the immune system were observed in mice, rats and dogs. Opportunistic infections related to \ndemodicosis (mange) were observed in dogs at exposures approximately 7 times the human exposure. \nDecreases in red blood cell parameters were observed in mice, rats and dogs at exposures \napproximately 6 to 36 times the human exposure. Degeneration of the sternal growth plate was \nobserved in some dogs, at low incidence and also in control animals, but with a dose-effect \nrelationship regarding severity. At present it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. \n \nIn rat and rabbit reproductive toxicology studies, baricitinib was shown to reduce foetal growth/weight \nand produce skeletal malformations (at exposures of approximately 10 and 39 times the human \nexposure, respectively). No adverse foetal effects were observed at exposures 2 times the human \nexposure based on AUC. \n \nIn a combined male/female rat fertility study, baricitinib decreased overall mating performance \n(decreased fertility and conception indices). In female rats there were decreased numbers of corpora \nlutea and implantation sites, increased pre-implantation loss, and/or adverse effects on intrauterine \n\n\n\n18 \n\nsurvival of the embryos. Since there were no effects on spermatogenesis (as assessed by \nhistopathology) or semen/sperm endpoints in male rats, the decreased overall mating performance was \nlikely the result of these female effects. \n \nBaricitinib was detected in the milk of lactating rats. In a pre- and postnatal development study, \ndecreased pup weights and decreased postnatal survival were observed at exposures 4 and 21 times, \nrespectively, the human exposure. \n \n \n6.

What Olumiant is and what it is used for \n \nOlumiant contains the active substance baricitinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Janus \nkinase inhibitors, which help to reduce inflammation.  \n \nOlumiant is used to treat adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease \nof the joints, if previous therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Olumiant can be used \nalone or together with some other medicines, such as methotrexate. \n \nOlumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called \u2018Janus kinase\u2019, which is \ninvolved in inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, Olumiant helps to reduce pain, \nstiffness and swelling in your joints, tiredness, and helps to slow damage to the bone and cartilage in \nthe joints.

VTE reporting rate is increasing. In July 2019 \nVTE reporting rate was 0,13% compared to 0,09% in February 2019. As of 01 July 2019, 114 VTEs \nhave been reported in 102 cases from post-marketing reports. Moreover, recurrent DVT and \nsubsequent PE observed September 2018 in patient who continued treatment with baricitinib after the \nfirst DVT also confirm possible relationship between use of baricitinib and occurrence of VTE. \nTherefore, the PRAC requests the MAH to update section 4.4 of the SmPC to modify the wording on \n\u201cVenous Thromboembolism\u201d to indicate that if clinical features of DVT/PE occur, baricitinib \ntreatment should be discontinued and to update section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction \npulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis with a frequency not known.  \n \nData from clinical studies shows that the incidence rate of urticaria and face oedema is higher in the \nbaricitinib 4 mg arm [urticarial: 0.60; face oedema: 0.89] compared to placebo arm [urticarial: 0.29; \nface oedema:0.29]. From the 316 events included for review from post-marketing reports, rash (n=95) \nwas the most frequently reported event. Swelling face (n=23) and urticaria (n=20) were also frequently \nreported. From the 316 events retrieved as of 13 May 2019, 78 were categorised as systemic/oedema \nand 38 were categorised as non-specific. Taking into account information provided by MAH, at least \npart of non-specific events were indeed systemic however due the limited information it is not possible \nto categorise them properly. Moreover positive dechallenge (e.g. one case categorised as systemic) and \npositive dechallenge and rechallenge (e.g. one case categorised as non-specific) also support the view \nthat baricitinib may cause systemic events. Therefore, the PRAC requests the MAH to update of \nsection 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning on hypersensitivity and to update of Section 4.8 to add the \nadverse reactions \u201crash\u201d with a frequency common and \u201cswelling of the face, urticaria\u201d with a \nfrequency uncommon.  \n \nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \n \nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) \n \nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for baricitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing baricitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed \nchanges to the product information \n \nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory disease of the joints, if previous therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. olumiant can be used alone or together with some other medicines, such as methotrexate. olumiant works by reducing the activity of an enzyme in the body called 'janus kinase', which is involved in inflammation. by reducing the activity of this enzyme, olumiant helps to reduce pain, stiffness and swelling in your joints, tiredness, and helps to slow damage to the bone and cartilage in the joints. these effects can help you to do normal daily activities and so improve the health-related quality of life for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "olumiant", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0,
