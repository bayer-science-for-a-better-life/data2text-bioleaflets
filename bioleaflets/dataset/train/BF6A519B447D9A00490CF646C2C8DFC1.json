PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for solution for infusion (powder for infusion). \n \nThe powder is white to off-white. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBeromun is indicated in adults. as an adjunct to surgery for subsequent removal of the tumour so as to \nprevent or delay amputation, or in the palliative situation, for irresectable soft tissue sarcoma of the \nlimbs, used in combination with melphalan via mild hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThis treatment should be undertaken in specialised centres by surgical teams experienced in the \nmanagement of limb sarcomas and ILP procedure, with an intensive care unit readily available and \nwith the facilities for continuous monitoring for medicinal product leakage into the systemic \ncirculation. \n \nPosology \n \nBeromun:  \nUpper limb: 3 mg total dose by ILP \nLower limb: 4 mg total dose by ILP \n \nMelphalan: \nMelphalan dose should be calculated according to the litre-volume method of Wieberdink \n(Wieberdink J, Benckhuysen C, Braat RP, van Slooten EA, Olthius GAA. Dosimetry in isolation \nperfusion of the limbs by assessments of perfused tissue volume and grading of toxic tissue reactions. \nEur J Cancer Clin Oncol 1982; 18: 905-910.), to a maximum dose of 150 mg. \n13 mg/l perfused upper limb volume \n10 mg/l perfused lower limb volume \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Beromun in children under 18 years have not been established. No data are \navailable. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nMethod of administration \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nWhen preparing and handling Beromun solutions, the use of gloves is recommended. If Beromun dry \npowder or reconstituted solution should come into contact with the skin or mucous membranes, they \nshould be washed thoroughly with water. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nBeromun should be administered by mild hyperthermic ILP. The perfusion circuit (roller pump, \noxygenator with integrated reservoir, heat exchanger, connecting tubing) should be prepared prior to \nsurgery and primed with 700 to 800 ml of perfusate, with haematocrit of 0.25 to 0.30. \n \nPerfusion level should be chosen to adequately encompass affected tissue (external iliac, common \nfemoral, femoro-popliteal, popliteal, axillary and brachial being accepted routes) and catheters \nintroduced. External heat loss from the limb should be prevented by application of thermal blankets \nand limb temperature continuously monitored by thermistor probes inserted into subcutaneous tissue \nand muscle. Hand and foot, if not affected, should be protected by Esmarch (expulsion) bandages. A \ntourniquet should be applied to the proximal limb. \n \nAfter connection of the limb to the isolated circuit, flow rate should be adjusted to 35 to 40 ml/litre \nlimb volume/minute and leakage from limb to systemic circulation checked using a radioactive tracer \ntechnique (see section 4.4). Adjustment of flow rate and tourniquet may be required to ensure leakage \nfrom perfusion circuit to systemic circulation is stable (systemic level of radioactivity has reached a \nplateau) and does not exceed 10 %. Beromun should only be administered if leakage is less than 10 %. \n \nOnce the temperature in the distal subcutaneous tissue of the limb has reached >38\u00b0C, (but not \nexceeding 39\u00b0C), and pH of the perfusate is between 7.2 and 7.35, Beromun should be injected as a \nbolus into the arterial line of the circuit. After 30 minutes perfusion of Beromun alone, melphalan \nshould be added as a bolus into the reservoir of the circuit, or slowly into the arterial line of the circuit. \nThe temperature should then be increased to >39\u00b0C (but not exceeding 40\u00b0C) in two different sites of \nmeasurement in the tumour area. The duration of the perfusion including melphalan should be 60 \nminutes. Thus, the duration of the total perfusion should be 90 minutes. \n \nAt the end of the perfusion, the perfusate should be collected into the reservoir while washout fluid is \nadded simultaneously to the circuit and circulated at the same flow rate of 35 to 40 ml/litre limb \nvolume/minute. Washout should be continued until the colour of the perfusate is clear pink, \ntransparent (see section 4.4). \n \nSurgical resection of the tumour remnant should be undertaken whenever possible. When necessary a \nsecond ILP can be considered 6-8 weeks after the first ILP (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications to Beromun ILP, subdivided by components of the procedure, are: \n \nContraindications to Beromun: \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSignificant cardiovascular disease, e.g. congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II, \nIII or IV), severe angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction within a 3 months period \nprior to treatment, venous thrombosis, occlusive peripheral arterial disease, recent pulmonary \nembolism. \n \nSevere pulmonary dysfunction. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nA recent history of, or active peptic ulcer. \n \nSevere ascites. \n \nSignificant haematological dysfunction, e.g. leucocytes < 2.5 x 109/l, haemoglobin < 9 g/dl, platelets < \n60 x 109/l, haemorrhagic diathesis or active bleeding disorder. \n \nSignificant renal dysfunction, e.g. nephrotic syndrome, serum creatinine > 150 \u00b5mol/l, or creatinine \nclearance of < 50 ml/min. \n \nSignificant hepatic dysfunction, e.g. > 2 x upper limits of normal levels of aspartate aminotransferase, \nalanine aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase; or bilirubin levels > 1.25 x upper limits of normal. \n \nHypercalcaemia > 12 mg/dl (2.99 mmol/l). \n \nPatients with contraindications to the use of vasopressor substances. \n \nPatients with contraindications to the use of anticoagulants. \n \nSimultaneous treatment with cardiotoxic substances (e.g. anthracyclines). \n \nPregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6). \n \nContraindications to melphalan: \n \nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for melphalan. \n \nContraindications to the ILP procedure: \n \nSevere ascites. \n \nSevere lymphoedema of the limb. \n \nPatients with contraindications to the use of vasopressor agents. \n \nPatients with contraindications to the use of anticoagulants. \n \nPatients with contraindications to radioactive tracer monitoring. \n \nPatients with contraindications to limb hyperthermia. \n \nPatients in whom the blood supply to the extremity distal to the tumour is suspected to be highly \ndependent on tumour associated blood vessels. This can be clarified by an arteriogram. \n \nPregnancy and lactation. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nILP should be undertaken in specialised centres by surgical teams experienced in the management of \nlimb sarcomas and ILP procedure, with an intensive care unit readily available and with the facilities \nfor continuous monitoring for medicinal product leakage into the systemic circulation. Beromun must \nnot be administered systemically.  \n \nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of melphalan prior to commencing an ILP \nprocedure. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nInduction of general anaesthesia and subsequent mechanical ventilation should be applied according to \nstandard methods. It is important to maintain a constant level of anaesthesia in order to prevent large \nfluctuations in systemic blood pressure, which can affect leakage between systemic circulation and \nperfusion circuit. \n \nDuring the ILP, central venous pressure and arterial pressure monitoring is strongly recommended. \nFurthermore, blood pressure, urine output and electrocardiographic monitoring should be routinely \nundertaken in the first 24 to 48 hours post-ILP, or longer if indicated. A Swan-Ganz catheter may be \nconsidered for monitoring pulmonary artery pressure and wedge pressure during the ILP and in the \npost-operative period. \n \nProphylaxis and treatment of fever, chills and other influenza-like symptoms associated with Beromun \nadministration can be achieved by pre-ILP administration of paracetamol (oral or by suppository) or \nan alternative analgesic/antipyretic. \n \nFor the prophylaxis of shock, patients should always be maximally hydrated prior to, during and after \nthe perfusion procedure. This is to ensure optimal haemodynamic conditions and ensure a high urinary \noutput, especially after the perfusion, to allow for rapid clearance of any residual tasonermin. \nAdditional resuscitation fluids (crystalloid and colloid solutions) should be available for volume \nexpansion in case of a significant fall in blood pressure. Colloids and hydroxyethyl starch fluids are \npreferred, as they are less likely to leak out of the vascular system. In addition, as the clinical situation \ndictates, a vasopressor agent, e.g. dopamine, can be considered for administration during the ILP \nprocedure, as well as in the post-operative period. In the event of severe shock before the end of the \nILP, the limb perfusion should be discontinued and appropriate therapy administered. \n \nIn order to minimise the risk of leakage of the perfusate into the systemic circulation, the perfusion \nflow rate should not exceed 40 ml/litre limb volume/minute. Potential leakage should be measured by \nradioactively labelled albumin or erythrocytes injected into the perfusion circuit, with appropriate \nmeasures for continuous monitoring of radioactivity leakage into the systemic circulation. Adjustment \nof flow rate and tourniquet may be required to ensure leakage is stable (systemic level of radioactivity \nhas reached a plateau) and does not exceed 10%. The perfusion should be terminated if the cumulative \nleakage into the systemic circulation is > 10%. In such cases, a standard wash-out procedure should \nfollow, using at least 2 litres of dextran 70 intravenous infusion or similar fluid. \n \nFollowing the ILP, a standard wash-out procedure should always be employed, using dextran 70 \nintravenous infusion or similar fluid. After lower limb perfusion, 3 to 6 litres should be used, and after \nupper limb perfusion, 1 to 2 litres. Popliteal and brachial perfusions may not need more than 1 litre. \nWash-out should continue until a clear (pink, transparent) venous outflow is obtained. \n \nMeasures should be taken to ensure that the periods of interrupted oxygen supply to the limb are as \nbrief as possible (20 minutes maximum). \n \nSurgical resection of the tumour remnant should be undertaken whenever possible. When necessary a \nsecond ILP can be considered 6-8 weeks after the first ILP. \n \nIf a second ILP is indicated, physicians should take into account the leakage rate of the previous ILP. \n \nThe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tasonermin for ILP is 4 mg, which is 10 times the systemic \nMTD. Therefore, whenever there is significant systemic leakage of tasonermin, serious undesirable \neffects are to be expected. Doses of up to 6 mg of other TNF\u03b1 preparations have been administered \nvia ILP, but this dose was found to be unacceptable in terms of loco-regional toxicity.  \n \nCombinations with cardiotoxic substances (e.g. anthracyclines) should be avoided because it is \npossible that tasonermin could enhance cardiotoxicity, as has been observed in preclinical 13-week \ntoxicological investigations. Concurrent administration of agents likely to cause significant \nhypotension is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nA number of therapeutic measures are routinely used during the ILP and in the immediate \npost-operative period. These include standard anaesthetic agents, analgesics, antipyretics, intravenous \nfluids, anticoagulants and vasopressor agents. There is no evidence that any of these agents \ncounteracts the pharmacodynamic effects of tasonermin. No significant interactions have so far been \nnoted, but caution should be exercised (see section 4.5).  \n \nIf signs of systemic toxicity appear for example fever, cardiac arrhythmias, shock/hypotension, adult \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), general supportive measures should be employed and the \npatient immediately transferred to an Intensive Care Unit for monitoring. Volume expanders and \nvasopressors are recommended. Artificial respiratory support may be required if ARDS develops. \nRenal and hepatic function should be closely monitored. Haematological disorders, in particular \nleukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia and clotting dysfunction, might be expected. \n \nCases of compartment syndrome characterised by pain, swelling and neurological symptoms, as well \nas muscle damage affecting the perfused limb have been observed in isolated patients treated with \nBeromun. Therefore patients should be monitored during the first three days after the ILP. In case the \nclinical diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made the following treatment should be considered:  \n- Fasciotomy of all muscle compartments of the limb affected, \n- Forced diuresis and alkalinisation of the urine, if a muscle damage occurs with increased \n\nmyoglobin levels in plasma and urine. \n \nThe reconstituted medicinal product contains up to 151.27 mg (6.58 mmol) sodium per recommended \ndose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nThe container of this medicinal product contains latex rubber. May cause severe allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \nBeromun has been co-administered with interferon-gamma in the ILP setting but no added value has \nbeen demonstrated. The addition of interferon-gamma to the tasonermin perfusate seems not to be \nassociated with significant increases in endogenous production of tasonermin or other inflammatory \ncytokines as shown in patients with severe trauma. Clinical data however indicate that the overall \nincidence of adverse events is increased if patients are simultaneously exposed to tasonermin and \ninterferon-gamma. \n \nCombinations with cardiotoxic substances (e.g. anthracyclines) should be avoided because it is \npossible that tasonermin could enhance cardiotoxicity, as has been observed in preclinical 13-week \ntoxicological investigations (see section 4.4). \n \nA number of therapeutic measures are routinely used during the ILP and in the immediate \npost-operative period. These include standard anaesthetic agents, analgesics, antipyretics, intravenous \nfluids, anticoagulants and vasopressor agents. There is no evidence that any of these agents \ncounteracts the pharmacodynamic effects of tasonermin. No significant interactions have so far been \nnoted, but caution should be exercised (see section 4.4). \n \nConcurrent administration of agents likely to cause significant hypotension is not recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics for melphalan should be consulted for information on the \ninteractions of melphalan. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of tasonermin in pregnant women. Animal studies are \ninsufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal development and postnatal development \n(see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Beromun is contraindicated in pregnancy \n(see section 4.3).  \n \nBreastfeeding \nIt is not known whether tasonermin is excreted in human milk. Because of the unknown risk to the \ninfant, breast-feeding is contraindicated within 7 days of ILP (see section 4.3). \n \nFertility \nNo data on the possible effect of this medicinal product on male and female fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nUndesirable effects may be related to Beromun, to melphalan, or to the ILP procedure and associated \nmeasures, or to a combination of these factors. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, \narrhythmia, chills, pain, wound infection and skin reaction. Adverse reactions are either local, \naffecting the limb treated with ILP, or systemic. Systemic adverse reactions include mild \nconstitutional reactions and toxic effects on different organ systems. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: \nVery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 \nto <1/1,000). \n \nInfections and infestations \n\nCommon:   Infection, wound infection \nUncommon:   Sepsis \n\n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nCommon:   Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia \n \nImmune system disorders \n Common:  Hypersensitivity reaction \n \nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon:   Nerve injury, peripheral neurotoxicity, altered state of consciouness, \nheadache \n\n \nCardiac disorders \n\nVery common:   Arrhythmia \nCommon:   Cardiac failure \n\n \nVascular disorders \n Common: Venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, shock, hypotension \n\n\n\n8 \n\n Uncommon: Peripheral arterial occlusive disease \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Common:  Adult respiratory distress syndrome \n Uncommon: Pulmonary oedema \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery common:  Nausea, vomiting \nCommon:  Diarrhoea, constipation \nUncommon: Abdominal pain upper, gastritis erosive \n\n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n Very common:  Hepatotoxicity \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Very common:  Skin reaction \n Common:  Skin necrosis, oedema peripheral \n Uncommon:  Onychomadesis (loss of nails) \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n Common:  Compartment syndrome, myalgia \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nCommon:  Proteinuria \nUncommon:  Renal failure acute \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common:  Fever, chills, pain, fatigue \nCommon:  Night sweats \n\n \nInvestigations \n Uncommon:  Blood creatinine increased \n \nSurgical and medical procedures \n Common:  Extremity necrosis, severe enough to warrant amputation \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nExtremity necrosis and compartment syndrome might be severe enough to warrant amputation. \n \nLate onset of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) of the lower limbs has been reported in \npatients several years after ILP, predominantly in patients presenting with established cardiovascular \nrisk factors, or who had undergone additional irradiation therapy of the concerned limb. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nShould accidental overdose occur, ILP should be terminated immediately and the limb washed out \nusing at least 2 litres of dextran 70 intravenous infusion or similar fluid (see also section 4.4).  \n \nIf signs of systemic toxicity appear, for example fever, cardiac arrhythmias, shock/hypotension, adult \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), general supportive measures should be employed and the \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\npatient immediately transferred to an Intensive Care Unit for monitoring. Volume expanders and \nvasopressors are recommended. Artificial respiratory support may be required if ARDS develops. \nRenal and hepatic function should be closely monitored. Haematological disorders, in particular \nleukopaenia, thrombocytopaenia and clotting dysfunction, might be expected. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for tasonermin currently available. Treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 antibodies \nis not recommended. \n \nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for melphalan for information on overdose of \nmelphalan. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunostimulants, ATC code: L03AX11 \n \nMechanism of action \nIn vivo antitumour activity is probably based on direct and indirect effects: \n \nDirect inhibition of tumour cell proliferation: Tasonermin is cytotoxic or cytostatic in vitro for a \nvariety of tumour cell lines of different histogenesis. \n \nDirect effects on tumour vasculature: Tasonermin affects the morphology and reduces proliferation of \nendothelial cells and modifies expression of specific cell surface and secretory proteins (including \nadhesion molecules and proteins modulating coagulation, interleukins and haematopoietic growth \nfactors). These changes in turn lead to a procoagulant state, resulting in microvascular thrombosis. \nFurther, adherence and extravasation of leukocytes is increased, leading to infiltration of the tumour \nby lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. The reason for the differential sensitivity of the tumour \nvasculature (high) versus normal vasculature (low) are currently unknown. \n \nIndirect and direct immunomodulation: Tasonermin has profound effects on cellular components of \nthe immune system. Proliferation of activated B- and T-lymphocytes, development of cytotoxic \nT-cells and immunoglobulin-secreting cells is enhanced, monocytes/macrophages are activated for \nkilling of tumour cells, granulocytes are activated to display enhanced phagocytic activity, respiratory \nburst and degranulation, and adherence to endothelium. Further, in addition to its direct effects, \ntasonermin modulates immune responses by inducing production of cytokines as well as low \nmolecular weight mediators (prostaglandins, platelet activating factor). Several lines of evidence \nsuggest that these immunomodulatory activities are of relevance for the antitumour effects; e.g. the \nantitumour activities of tasonermin are much less pronounced in immunodeficient animals. Further, \nanimals that reject experimental tumours following tasonermin treatment may develop specific \nimmunity for this tumour cell type. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nTasonermin has been shown to be active in the classic assay for tumour necrosis factor, producing \nhaemorrhagic necrosis of tumour nodules in murine syngeneic and human xenogeneic tumour systems \nafter local or systemic injection. The systemic application of tasonermin is limited by its toxic effects, \nthe effective dose predicted from preclinical studies being substantially higher than the observed \nhuman maximum tolerated dose.  \n \nClinical efficacy \nThe loco-regional application of Beromun, along with melphalan, has been shown to be highly \neffective for local control of irresectable soft tissue sarcomas of the limbs. However, the treatment is \nspecifically a loco-regional treatment and is not expected to influence survival. A matched-pair \nsurvival analysis of patients treated by Beromun and melphalan ILP as compared to a historical \ncontrol failed to demonstrate any survival difference (p=0.5). \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSystemic pharmacokinetics \nThe systemic pharmacokinetic information on tasonermin is sparse. A dose-dependency has been \nobserved as indicated by a decrease in clearance and an increase in half-life at increasing doses. The \nterminal half-life at the maximum tolerated intravenous dose (150 \u00b5g/m2) was 15-30 min. \n \nPharmacokinetics in ILP \nILP allows the administration of high and fairly stable concentrations of tasonermin to the limb. Data \nobtained from 51 ILP patients demonstrated maximum concentrations of tasonermin in the perfusion \ncircuit are reached 30 min after the onset of ILP and range between 3000 and 4000 ng/ml. Under \nconditions of less than 2% systemic leakage (observed in 38 of 51 patients), maximum systemic \ncirculation concentrations of tasonermin were reached 5 min after the start of ILP and are \napproximately 200 times less than in the perfusion circuit. Under conditions of greater than 2 % \nsystemic leakage (observed in 13 of 51 patients) maximum systemic concentrations of tasonermin \nwere still at least ten times lower than in the perfusion circuit.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe toxicological profile of tasonermin has been investigated in preclinical studies using mice, rats, \nrabbits, dogs and monkeys. Haematological and circulatory changes, decreased well-being and weight \ngain as well as alterations in the function of liver and kidneys were the main adverse effects observed \non repeated tasonermin administration. The haematological changes included anaemia, increased \nhaematocrit and increased or decreased leukocytes and platelets depending upon species and treatment \nduration. The circulatory changes included decreased blood pressure and, in some studies, increased \nheart rate and decreased contractility. The synthesis capacity of the liver was lowered as indicated by \nincreased liver enzymes. Altered renal function comprised increased water and sodium excretion as \nwell as increased urea and creatinine. No NOTEL (No Observed Toxic Effect Level) could be \nestablished in the preclinical studies with the exception of a 7-day administration of 0.1 \u00b5g/kg in \nmonkeys. The changes observed at the low dose of the 13-week studies can be classified as minimal \nand fully reversible.  \n \nTasonermin does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier to a significant extent in mice. In the Rhesus \nmonkey, whole body radiography following administration of radiolabelled tasonermin indicated no \nspecific distribution pattern. Tasonermin did not cross the placenta or pass into necrotic tumour. In the \nRhesus monkey, pharmacokinetic studies following intravenous injection of tasonermin indicated a \nnon-specific, non-saturable excretion via glomerular filtration in the kidney. A second specific and \nsaturable elimination mechanism involving tasonermin receptors seems likely. \n \nNo evidence has been found of any mutagenic effect, neither in vivo nor in vitro. No reproduction \ntoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were performed due to testing being inappropriate as the intended \nclinical use of Beromun is in ILP for soft tissue sarcoma treatment.  \n \nTo cover the intended clinical use of Beromun, ILP experiments were performed in hind legs of \nhealthy rats using different doses in the same tasonermin concentration as in the clinical situation in \nthe human. Except for slight aggravation of ischaemic effects in higher doses, standard histological \nexaminations of the skin, muscle, bone, nerves and vessels revealed no difference in findings between \ntasonermin-treated and control animals. No late detrimental effects of tasonermin were seen. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nBeromun 1 mg powder for solution for infusion \nTasonermin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects , talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Beromun is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Beromun \n3. How to use Beromun \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Beromun \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Beromun is and what it is used for \n  \nBeromun contains the active substance tasonermin (tumor necrosis factor alfa-1a), produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology. It belongs to a class of medicines known as immunostimulants, which \nhelp your body\u2019s immune system fight cancer cells. \n \nBeromun is used, together with melphalan containing medicine, for the treatment of soft tissue \nsarcoma of the arms and legs. By reducing the size of the tumour, the treatment is intended to facilitate \nthe removal of the tumor by surgery or to prevent severe damage to the surrounding healthy tissue and \nthus to delay or prevent the need for arm or leg amputation.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Beromun \n \nDo not use Beromun \n- if you are allergic to tasonermin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have significant heart problems \n- if you have severe lung disease \n- if you have or have recently had a stomach ulcer \n- if you have too low numbers of blood cells or bleeding problems \n- if you have moderate to severe liver or kidney disease \n- if you cannot use vasopressors (used to increase low blood pressure), anticoagulants (used to \n\nprevent blood clotting) or radioactive tracers \n- if you are also using medicines with heart toxicity  \n- if you have raised levels of calcium in your blood \n- if you have certain infections which do not respond to antibiotics \n- if you have severe swelling of the affected arm or leg due to local fluid build-up, or severe fluid \n\nbuild-up in the abdomen \n- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n- if you are breast-feeding, you must stop for at least seven days after receiving Beromun \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nBeromun will be administered by a doctor who is experienced and skilled in isolated limb perfusion \n(ILP). This technique ensures that Beromun is kept within the affected arm or leg. It is important that \n\n\n\n22 \n\nit does not reach other parts of your body, because this so-called systemic leakage could cause serious \nside effects on the main organs of the body.  \n \nDuring the IPL and the seven to ten day period afterwards you will need to stay in hospital, your \ndoctor will carefully monitor your blood pressure, circulation and any side effects. You may have to \nstay in an intensive care unit (ICU) directly after the ILP for a short time. \n \nA condition called \u201ccompartment syndrome\u201d may develop within the first three days after Beromun \nadministration. Symptoms of muscle damage at the perfused limb include pain, swelling, as well as \nneurological symptoms (e. g. paraesthesia, paralysis), all of which should be reported immediately to \nthe attending doctor. \n \nOther medicines and Beromun \nTell your doctor if you are using,  have recently used or might use any other medicines. In particular, \nyou should tell your doctor if you are using medicines to lower blood pressure (to treat hypertension). \n \nFor ILP, you will also receive other medicines to control pain, fever, blood pressure and blood \nclotting, as well as general anaesthesia. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must not use Beromun if you are pregnant. \nYou must not breast-feed for at least seven days after treatment with Beromun. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNot relevant \n \nBeromun contains sodium \nThe reconstituted medicinal product contains up to 151.27 mg (6.58 mmol) sodium per recommended \ndose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nThe container contains latex rubber \nThe container of this medicinal product contains latex rubber. May cause severe allergic reactions. \n \n \n3. How to use Beromun \n \nBeromun will be administered by isolated limb perfusion (ILP), together with the anti-tumour agent \nmelphalan. This will occur whilst you are unconscious, under the influence of a general anaesthetic. \n \nThe blood flow to and from your affected limb will be stopped using a tourniquet. Blood, supplied \nwith oxygen by a heart and lung machine, is pumped into your affected limb via a catheter in the main \nartery, while it is drained (pumped out) from the main vein. Beromun and then melphalan are injected \ninto this circuit, over a total of 90 minutes the affected limb will be exposed to Beromun. \n \nThe recommended dose of Beromun depends on the affected limb, usually 3 mg for the arm and 4 mg \nfor the leg. Beromun powder has to be dissolved before use. The resulting solution will be \nadministered into an artery in your affected arm or leg by ILP for an initial period of 30 minutes.  \nAfter that, melphalan will be added and the ILP continued for another 60 minutes.  \nFinally, your limb will be washed out to remove the rest of Beromun and melphalan. \n \nILP allows that tumour cells in your limb can be exposed to a very high dose of Beromun and \nmelphalan, enhancing their anti-tumour effect, but without reaching the rest of the body, where they \ncould cause serious side effects.  \n \nYou will usually not receive a second ILP with Beromun. If you do, this will not be until at least six \nweeks after your first ILP. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIf you use more Beromun than you should \nAs Beromun is always administered by experienced and qualified hospital doctors, accidental \noverdose is extremely unlikely. However, should this occur, your doctor will immediately wash out \nyour affected limb to remove Beromun, and the ILP will be stopped. If there is any risk of serious side \neffects, your doctor will immediately transfer you to an intensive care unit to closely monitor you and \nstart adequate treatment. \n \nIf there is significant systemic leakage of Beromun \nIf more than 10% of your Beromun dose reaches the main part of your body, your doctor will take \nsimilar measures as in the case of overdose.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects may be caused by Beromun, melphalan, the ILP technique or a combination of these \nfactors. Some of the side effects can be serious, particularly if Beromun reaches other parts of your \nbody (systemic leakage). In approximately 2% of cases, Beromun may cause tissue damage in your \naffected arm or leg which is severe enough to require amputation. If there is any risk of serious side \neffects, your doctor will immediately transfer you to an intensive care unit to closely monitor you and \nstart adequate treatment. \n \nThe following side effects were observed during treatment with this medicine (grouped by how likely \nthey are to happen). \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- disturbances in your heart beat (arrhythmia) \n- feeling sick, vomiting \n- liver damage \n- blistering of the skin \n- fever (usually mild to moderate), chills \n- pain in the affected arm or leg \n- tiredness (fatigue) \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- infections \n- local wound infections \n- reductions in numbers of certain white blood cells and platelets \n- hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions \n- nerve damage \n- decreased consciouness  \n- headache \n- heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling \n- blood clot formation in the artery or vein of the affected arm or leg (thrombosis) \n- low blood pressure, shock \n- severe breathing problems \n- constipation, diarrhoea \n- skin necrosis (death of skin cells) in the affected arm or leg \n- swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers caused by fluid build up in the affected arm or leg \n- \u201ccompartment syndrome\u201d, a medical condition characterised by pain, swelling and neurological \n\nsymptoms, as well as muscle damage in the affected arm or leg \n- muscle pain \n- protein in urine \n- night sweats \n\n\n\n24 \n\n- tissue necrosis (death of tissue cells) in the affected arm or leg, which is severe enough to \nrequire amputation \n\n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n- blood poisoning (sepsis) \n- fluid in the lungs \n- stomach ache \n- inflammation of the gastric mucosa (gastritis)  \n- temporary loss of finger or toe nails of the affected arm or leg \n- kidney failure \n- blood tests showing changes in the way the kidneys are working \n- narrowing or closing of limb vessels carrying blood from the heart \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor.

beromun", "Section_Content": "beromun will be administered by isolated limb perfusion (ilp), together with the anti-tumour agent melphalan. this will occur whilst you are unconscious, under the influence of a general anaesthetic. the blood flow to and from your affected limb will be stopped using a tourniquet. blood, supplied with oxygen by a heart and lung machine, is pumped into your affected limb via a catheter in the main artery, while it is drained (pumped out) from the main vein. beromun and then melphalan are injected into this circuit, over a total of 90 minutes the affected limb will be exposed to beromun. the recommended dose of beromun depends on the affected limb, usually 3 mg for the arm and 4 mg for the leg. beromun powder has to be dissolved before use. the resulting solution will be administered into an artery in your affected arm or leg by ilp for an initial period of 30 minutes. after that, melphalan will be added and the ilp continued for another 60 minutes. finally, your limb will be washed out to remove the rest of beromun and melphalan. ilp allows that tumour cells in your limb can be exposed to a very high dose of beromun and melphalan, enhancing their anti-tumour effect, but without reaching the rest of the body, where they could cause serious side effects. you will usually not receive a second ilp with beromun. if you do, this will not be until at least six weeks after your first ilp. if you use more beromun than you should as beromun is always administered by experienced and qualified hospital doctors, accidental overdose is extremely unlikely. however, should this occur, your doctor will immediately wash out your affected limb to remove beromun, and the ilp will be stopped. if there is any risk of serious side effects, your doctor will immediately transfer you to an intensive care unit to closely monitor you and start adequate treatment. if there is significant systemic leakage of beromun if more than 10% of your beromun dose reaches the main part of your body, your doctor will take similar measures as in the case of overdose. if you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor.",

everybody gets them. side effects may be caused by beromun, melphalan, the ilp technique or a combination of these factors. some of the side effects can be serious, particularly if beromun reaches other parts of your body (systemic leakage). in approximately 2% of cases, beromun may cause tissue damage in your affected arm or leg which is severe enough to require amputation. if there is any risk of serious side effects, your doctor will immediately transfer you to an intensive care unit to closely monitor you and start adequate treatment. the following side effects were observed during treatment with this medicine (grouped by how likely they are to happen). very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) - disturbances in your heart beat (arrhythmia) - feeling sick, vomiting - liver damage - blistering of the skin - fever (usually mild to moderate), chills - pain in the affected arm or leg - tiredness (fatigue) common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) - infections - local wound infections - reductions in numbers of certain white blood cells and platelets - hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions - nerve damage - decreased consciouness - headache - heart problems which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling - blood clot formation in the artery or vein of the affected arm or leg (thrombosis) - low blood pressure, shock - severe breathing problems - constipation, diarrhoea - skin necrosis (death of skin cells) in the affected arm or leg - swelling of the ankles, feet or fingers caused by fluid build up in the affected arm or leg - \"compartment syndrome\", a medical condition characterised by pain, swelling and neurological symptoms, as well as muscle damage in the affected arm or leg - muscle pain - protein in urine - night sweats 24 - tissue necrosis (death of tissue cells) in the affected arm or leg, which is severe enough to require amputation uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) - blood poisoning (sepsis) - fluid in the lungs - stomach ache - inflammation of the gastric mucosa (gastritis) - temporary loss of finger or toe nails of the affected arm or leg - kidney failure - blood tests showing changes in the way the kidneys are working - narrowing or closing of limb vessels carrying blood from the heart reporting of side effects if you get any side effects talk to your doctor. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on
