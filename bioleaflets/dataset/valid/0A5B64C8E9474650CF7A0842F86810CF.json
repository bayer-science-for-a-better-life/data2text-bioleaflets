This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nOBIZUR 500 U powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach powder vial contains nominally 500 Units of B domain deleted antihaemophilic Factor VIII \n(recombinant), porcine sequence, susoctocog alfa. \n \nOBIZUR contains approximately 500 U/ml susoctocog alfa after reconstitution. \n \nThe potency (U) is determined using the one-stage coagulation assay (OSCA). The specific activity of \nOBIZUR is approximately 10,000 U/mg protein. \n \nOBIZUR (antihaemophilic Factor VIII (recombinant), porcine sequence) is a purified protein that \nhas 1448 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 175kDa. \nIt is produced by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The \nBHK cells are cultured in media that contains fetal bovine serum. The manufacturing process is free of \nhuman serum and human protein products and does not contain any additional animal derived \nmaterials. \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect \nEach vial contains 4.4 mg (198 mM) sodium per ml of reconstituted solution. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nThe powder is white. \nThe solvent is clear and colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of bleeding episodes in patients with acquired haemophilia caused by antibodies to Factor \nVIII. \n \nOBIZUR is indicated in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with OBIZUR should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment \nof haemophilia. \n \nThe product is for in-patient administration only. It requires clinical supervision of the bleeding status \nof the patient. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nThe dose, frequency, and duration of the therapy with OBIZUR depend on the location, extent and \nseverity of the bleeding episode, target Factor VIII activity, and on the patient\u00b4s clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of Factor VIII administered is expressed in Units (U) that are derived from an \nin-house standard that has been calibrated with the current WHO standard for Factor VIII products. \nOne Unit (U) of Factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of Factor VIII in one ml of normal \nhuman plasma. \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 200 U per kilogram bodyweight, given by intravenous injection (see \nsection 6.6). \n \nThe required initial dose of OBIZUR for a patient is calculated using the following formula: \n \n\nInitial dose (U/kg) \u00f7 Product strength (U/vial) \u00d7 Body weight (kg) = Number of vials \n \ne.g. for a 70 kg subject the number of vials for an initial dose will be calculated as follows: \n\n200 U/kg \u00f7 500 U/vial \u00d7 70 kg = 28 vials \n \nMonitor Factor VIII activity and clinical condition 30 minutes after the first injection and 3 hours after \nadministering OBIZUR. \nMonitor Factor VIII activity immediately prior to and 30 minutes after subsequent doses and refer to \nthe table below for recommended target Factor VIII trough levels. \nThe one-stage clotting assay for Factor VIII is recommended as it has been used in determination of \nthe potency of OBIZUR and the mean recovery rate (see section 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nThe dose and frequency of administration should be based on results of Factor VIII activity (to be \nmaintained within recommended limits) and on the clinical response achieved. \n \nEfficacy and safety data in patients with acquired haemophilia are limited (see section 5.1). \n \nInitial Phase \n \nType of Bleeding  Target Factor VIII \n\nTrough Activity \n(Units per dL or % of \nnormal) \n\nInitial \nDose \n(Units per \nkg) \n \n\nSubsequent \nDose \n\nFrequency and \nDuration of \nSubsequent \nDosing  \n\nMild and moderate \nsuperficial muscle / \nno neurovascular \ncompromise and \njoint bleeding \n\n> 50% \n\n200 \n\nTitrate \nsubsequent \ndoses based on \nclinical response \nand to maintain \ntarget Factor \nVIII trough \nactivity \n \n\nDose \nevery 4 to 12 hours, \nfrequency may be \nadjusted based on \nclinical response \nand measured \nFactor VIII activity \n \n\nMajor moderate to \nsevere \nintramuscular, \nretroperitoneal, \ngastrointestinal, \nintracranial bleeding \n \n\n> 80% \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHealing phase \n \nOnce bleeding has responded, usually within the first 24 hours, continue OBIZUR with a dose that \nmaintains the trough FVIII activity at 30-40% until bleeding is controlled. The maximum blood FVIII \nactivity must not exceed 200%. \n \nThe length of treatment depends on clinical judgement. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nUse in children and adolescents below 18 years with congenital or in rare cases of acquired \nhaemophilia is currently not approved. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nIntravenous use. \n \nThe total volume of reconstituted OBIZUR should be administered at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nKnown anaphylactic reactions to the active substance, hamster protein, or to any of the excipients \nlisted in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with OBIZUR. The product contains trace \namounts of hamster proteins. \nIf symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal \nproduct immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of \nhypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, \nhypotension, and anaphylaxis. \n \nIn case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nDevelopment of inhibitory antibodies \n \nInhibitory antibodies against porcine Factor VIII (measured using a modification of the Nijmegen \nvariation of the Bethesda assay) were detected before and after exposure to OBIZUR. Inhibitor titres \nof up to 29 Bethesda units were recorded at baseline yet subjects responded positively to OBIZUR. It \nis recommended that treatment should be based on clinical judgement and not based on detection of \ninhibitory antibodies by the Bethesda assay. \n \nThere is a lack of clinical information on the development of inhibitory antibodies to OBIZUR \nfollowing repeated administration. Therefore, OBIZUR must only be administered when considered \nclinically necessary. Extensive cutaneous purpura do not necessarily require treatment. \n \nOBIZUR is produced by recombinant DNA technology in baby hamster kidney cells. Antibodies to \nbaby hamster kidney cell protein were not detected in subjects after exposure to OBIZUR. \n \nHigh and sustained Factor VIII activity in blood may predispose to thromboembolic events. Those \nwith pre-existing cardiovascular disease and the elderly are at particular risk. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIf venous catheterisation is required, the risk of catheter-related complications such as catheter site \nthrombosis should be considered. \n \nFactor VIII activity determined by the chromogenic assay is generally lower than Factor VIII activity \ndetermined by the one-stage clotting assay. Measurement of Factor VIII activity must always be \ncarried out using the same assay methodology on any one patient. The one-stage assay is \nrecommended because it has been used in determination of the potency and the mean recovery rate of \nOBIZUR (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nName and batch number \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that OBIZUR is administered to a patient, the name and \nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \nof the medicinal product. \n \nSodium content \nEach vial contains 4.4 mg (198 mM) sodium per ml of reconstituted solution. \nTo be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of OBIZUR with other medicinal products have been reported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with OBIZUR. Experience regarding the use of \nOBIZUR during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, OBIZUR should be used \nduring pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOBIZUR has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile: \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninjection site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) are possible and may \nprogress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock) (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients with acquired haemophilia may develop inhibitory antibodies to porcine Factor VIII. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions: \n \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). In the clinical trial of OBIZUR for acquired haemophilia, 29 adult subjects \nwere evaluable for safety. \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u22651/10), \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \n \nSystem Organ Class Preferred MedDRA term Frequency  \nInvestigations Positive test for inhibitory \n\nantibodies against porcine Factor \nVIII (see section 4.4) \n\nCommon \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions the national reporting system listed \nin Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of higher than recommended doses of OBIZUR have not been characterised. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation Factor VIII, porcine sequence. \n\nATC code: B02BD14 \n \nMechanism of action \nObizur is a recombinant, B-domain deleted, porcine sequence Factor VIII (susoctocog alfa). It is a \nglycoprotein. \nImmediately after release in the patient\u2019s circulation, Factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor \n(vWF). The Factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (Factor VIII and \nvon Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. Activated Factor VIII acts as a co-factor \nfor activated Factor IX, accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X, which \nultimately converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a \nclot can be formed. \n \nAcquired haemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder in which patients with normal Factor VIII genes \ndevelop inhibitory autoantibodies directed against Factor VIII. These autoantibodies neutralize \ncirculating human Factor VIII thus creating a deficiency of available Factor VIII. Circulating \nantibodies (inhibitors) targeted against human Factor VIII have minimal or no cross reactivity against \nOBIZUR. \nOBIZUR temporarily replaces the inhibited endogenous Factor VIII that is needed for effective \nhaemostasis. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of OBIZUR for the treatment of serious bleeding episodes in subjects with \nacquired haemophilia with autoimmune inhibitory antibodies to human Factor VIII was investigated in \na prospective, non-randomised, open-label trial of 28 subjects (18 Caucasian, 6 Black, and 4 Asian). \nThe trial included subjects presenting with life and / or limb threatening bleeding requiring \nhospitalisation. \n \nAll initial bleeding episodes had a positive response to treatment at 24 hours after initial dosing as \nassessed by the primary investigator. A positive response was one where bleeding had stopped or was \nreduced, with clinical improvement or with Factor VIII activity above a pre-specified target. \n \nA positive response was observed in 95% (19/20) of subjects evaluated at 8 hours and 100% (18/18) \nat 16 hours. In addition to response to treatment, the overall treatment success was determined by the \ninvestigator based on his/her ability to discontinue or reduce the dose and/or dosing frequency of \nOBIZUR. A total of 24/28 (86%) had successful control (resolution) of the initial bleeding episode. Of \nthose subjects treated with OBIZUR as first-line therapy, defined as no immediate previous use of \nanti-haemorrhagic agents prior to the first OBIZUR treatment, 16/17 (94%) had eventual treatment \nsuccess reported. Eleven subjects were reported to have received anti-haemorrhagic agents (eg. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nrFVIIa, activated prothrombin-complex concentrate, tranexamic acid) prior to first treatment with \nOBIZUR. Of these 11 subjects, eight had eventual successful treatment (73%). \n \nThe median dose per injection to successfully treat the primary bleed was 133 U/kg and the median \ntotal dose was 1523 U/kg for a median of 6 days. The median number of daily infusions per subject \nwas 1.76 (range: 0.2 to 5.6). In the initial 24 hour period, the median total dose of 493 U/kg were \nutilized in the clinical study with a median of 3 infusions. When treatment was required \nbeyond 24 hours, a median total dose of 1050 U/kg were utilized with a median of 10.5 infusions \n(median dose 100 U/kg) to control a bleeding episode. \n \nOther information \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nOBIZUR in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of acquired haemophilia (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019. This means that due to \nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \nproduct. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic data from 5 subjects with acquired haemophilia whilst in a non-bleeding state are \n\npresented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Individual pharmacokinetic data for factor VIII activity after administration of the \nfinal dose of OBIZUR to 5 subjects with acquired haemophilia. Subjects were in a non-bleeding \nstate. Factor VIII activity was measured by the one-stage clotting assay.  \n\nSubject Dose (U) \n\nDose \n(U/kg) \n\nBaseline \nhFVIII \nactivity \n\n(%) \n\nt\u00bd (h) Tmax (h) \nAmax \n(%) \n\nAUC0-t \n(%\u00b7t) \n\nAUC0-\u221e \n(%\u00b7t) \n\n \n \n\n1 5000 76.7 89 17 0.42 213 3124 4988 \n2 2934 30.0 18 4.6 0.42 100 694 712 \n3 7540 144.2 3 5.3 0.45 74 473 492 \n4 9720 206.8 0 1.8 0.50 53 122 135 \n5 10000 133.3 N/A 4.2 0.75 178 1583 1686 \nAmax = maximum observed % activity; AUC0-t = area under the concentration-time curve from \n\ntime 0 to the last measurable concentration; AUC0-\u221e = area under the concentration-time curve \nfrom time 0 extrapolated to infinity; t\u00bd = terminal half-life; Tmax = time of maximum observed % \nactivity, N/A = not available. \n\n \nThe mean recovery rate after the initial dose of 200 U/kg was 1.06 \u00b1 0.75 U/ml per U/kg \n(range 0.10-2.61) measured with the one stage coagulation assay. \n \nAlthough factor VIII activity determined by the chromogenic assay is generally lower than the Factor \nVIII activity determined by the one-stage clotting assay, post-infusion Factor VIII activities in patients \nwith acquired haemophilia in clinical study OBI-1-301 tended to be higher when determined with the \nchromogenic assay than with the one-stage clotting assay (see section 4.4). \n \nInhibitory antibodies against OBIZUR were measured using a modification of the Nijmegen variation \nof the Bethesda assay method. Three subjects included in pharmacokinetic analysis had a detectable \nanti-porcine factor VIII inhibitor titre at baseline (\u2265 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU)/mL). Three of the five \nsubjects had no detectable anti-porcine Factor VIII titres post-treatment (< 0.6 BU/mL based on the \nlast reported result), two subjects had a detectable anti-porcine Factor VIII titre (\u2265 0.6 BU/mL). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe mean half-life of OBIZUR in nine evaluable subjects in the bleeding state was (about) 10 hours \n(range 2.6 to 28.6 hours). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology or repeated dose toxicity.However, in repeated dose toxicity studies, the incidence and \nseverity of glomerulopathy observed in monkeys intravenously administered OBIZUR at doses \nof 75, 225 and 750 U/kg/day tended to increase over time. \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with OBIZUR. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n22 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nOBIZUR 500 U powder and solvent for solution for injection \nSusoctocog alfa \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What OBIZUR is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use OBIZUR \n3. How to use OBIZUR \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store OBIZUR \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What OBIZUR is and what it is used for \n \nOBIZUR contains the active substance susoctocog alfa, antihaemophilic Factor VIII, porcine \nsequence. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. \nIn patients with acquired haemophilia, FVIII is not working properly because the patient has \ndeveloped antibodies to his own Factor VIII which neutralize this blood clotting factor. \n \nOBIZUR is used for the treatment of bleeding episodes in adults with acquired haemophilia (a \nbleeding disorder caused by lack of Factor VIII activity due to antibody development). These \nantibodies have less neutralizing effect against OBIZUR than against human Factor VIII. \n \nOBIZUR restores this missing Factor VIII activity and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use OBIZUR \n \nThe product is for in-patient administration only. It requires clinical supervision of the bleeding status \nof the patient. \n \nDo not use OBIZUR: \n- if you are allergic to susoctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n- if you are allergic to hamster proteins (trace amounts may be present in Obizur arising from the \n\nmanufacturing process) \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor before using OBIZUR. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \nThere is a rare chance that you may experience an allergic reaction to OBIZUR. You should be aware \nof the early signs of allergic reactions (see section 4 for signs and symptoms). If any of these \nsymptoms occur, the injection should be stopped. Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing \nand (near) fainting, require emergency treatment. \n \nPatients developing inhibitory antibodies to OBIZUR \nYour doctor may check if you have inhibitory antibodies to porcine Factor VIII. \nYour doctor will check your blood Factor VIII to confirm that enough Factor VIII is being given to \nyou. Your doctor will also check if the bleeding is adequately controlled. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you have had a cardiovascular disease in the past or if you have a known risk of \nthrombosis (diseases from blood clots in normal vasculature), because the possiblity of developing \nthromboembolic diseases at high and sustained blood Factor VIII levels cannot be excluded. \n \nName and batch number \nIt is strongly recommended that every time OBIZUR is used, the name and batch number of the \nmedicine are recorded by the medical professional to maintain a link between your treatment and the \nbatch of the medicine. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nOBIZUR is not currently approved for treatment of patients under 18 years of age, in whom acquired \nhaemophilia is rare. \n \nOther medicines and OBIZUR \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. No interactions \nof OBIZUR with other medicines are known. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOBIZUR has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nOBIZUR contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 4.4 mg sodium per milliliter once it is made up. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to use OBIZUR \n \nTreatment with OBIZUR will be conducted by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia (bleeding disorders). \n \nYour doctor will calculate your dose of OBIZUR (in units or U) depending on your condition and \nbody weight. The frequency and duration of administration will depend on how well OBIZUR is \nworking for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with OBIZUR is a temporary treatment until \nbleeding is resolved or the antibodies against your own Factor VIII are eradicated. \n \nThe recommended first dose is 200 U per kilogram bodyweight given by intravenous injection. \n \nYour doctor will measure your Factor VIII activity regularly to decide the subsequent dose and \nfrequency of OBIZUR. \nThe bleeding will usually respond within the first 24 hours, your doctor will adjust the dose and \nduration of OBIZUR until the bleeding stopped. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nThe total volume of reconstituted OBIZUR should be administered at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute. \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \nsure. \n \nIf you use more OBIZUR than you should \nAlways use OBIZUR exactly as your doctor has told you. If you use more OBIZUR than \n\nrecommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n \nIf you forget to use OBIZUR \nDo not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. You should contact your doctor if you \nmissed a dose and do not know how to compensate for this. \n \nIf you stop using OBIZUR \nDo not stop using OBIZUR without consulting your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nIf severe and sudden allergic reactions occur, the injection must be stopped immediately. You must \ncontact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms: \n \n- Swelling of lips and tongue \n- Burning and stinging at the injection site \n- Chills, flushing \n- Hives, generalised itching \n- Headache, low blood pressure \n- Lethargy, sickness, restlessness \n- Rapid beating of the heart, tightness of the chest \n- Tingling, vomiting \n- Wheezing \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n- Development of antibodies against the medicine \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store OBIZUR \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton, on the vial and on the \npre-filled syringe after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \n \nUse the reconstituted solution immediately but no longer than 3 hours once the powder is completely \ndissolved. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nAfter reconstitution the solution should be clear and colourless. \nDo not administer if particulate matter or discoloration is found. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Repeat following reconstitution instructions for each powder vial to be reconstituted. \n \nReconstitution \n \nUse aseptic technique during the reconstitution procedure. \n \n1. Bring the OBIZUR powder vial and pre-filled diluent solvent syringe to room temperature. \n2. Remove the plastic cap from the OBIZUR powder vial (Figure A). \n3. Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab (not supplied) and allow it to dry prior to use. \n4. Peel back the cover of the vial adapter package (Figure B). Do not to touch the luer lock (tip) in \n\nthe centre of the vial adapter. Do not remove the vial adapter from the package. \n5. Place the vial adapter package on a clean surface with the luer lock pointing up. \n6. Snap off the tamper resistant cap of the pre-filled solvent syringe (Figure C). \n7. While firmly holding the vial adapter package connect the pre-filled solvent syringe to the vial \n\nadapter by pushing the syringe tip down onto the luer lock in the centre of the vial adapter, and \nturning it clockwise until the syringe is secured. Do not over tighten (Figure D). \n\n8. Remove the plastic package (Figure E). \n9. Place the OBIZUR powder vial on a clean, flat, hard surface. Place the vial adapter over the \n\nOBIZUR powder vial and firmly push the filter spike of the vial adapter through the centre of \nthe OBIZUR powder vial\u2019s rubber circle until the clear plastic cap snaps onto the vial \n(Figure F). \n\n10. Push the plunger down to slowly inject all of the diluent from the syringe into the OBIZUR \npowder vial. \n\n11. Gently swirl (in a circular motion) the OBIZUR powder vial without removing the syringe until \nall of the powder is fully dissolved /reconstituted (Figure G). The reconstituted solution should \nbe inspected visually for particulate matter before administration. Do not use if particulate \nmatter or discoloration is observed. \n\n12. With one hand hold the powder vial and vial adapter, and with the other hand firmly grasp the \nbarrel of the pre-filled solvent syringe and in a counterclockwise motion unscrew the syringe \nfrom the vial adapter (Figure H). \n\n13. Use OBIZUR immediately and within 3 hours after reconstitution when stored at room \ntemperature. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n \nFigure A Figure B Figure C Figure D \n\n    \nFigure E Figure F Figure G Figure H \n\n    \n \nAdministration \n \nFor intravenous injection only! \n \n\u2022 Inspect the reconstituted OBIZUR solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \n\nadministration. The solution should be clear and colorless in appearance. Do not administer if \nparticulate matter or discoloration is observed. \n\n\u2022 Do not administer OBIZUR in the same tubing or container with other medicinal products for \ninjection. \n\n \nUsing aseptic technique, administer using the following procedure: \n1. Once all vials have been reconstituted, connect a large syringe to the vial adapter by gently \n\npushing the syringe tip down onto the luer lock in the centre of the vial adapter, and turning \nclockwise until the syringe is secured. \n\n2. Invert the vial; push the air in the syringe into the vial and withdraw the reconstituted OBIZUR \ninto the syringe (Figure I). \n\n \nFigure I \n\n \n \n3. Unscrew the large syringe counterclockwise from the vial adapter, and repeat this process for all \n\nreconstituted vials of OBIZUR until the total volume to be administered is reached. \n4. Administer the reconstituted OBIZUR intravenously at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute. \n \nThe required initial dose of Obizur for a patient is calculated using the following formula: \n\nInitial dose (U/kg) \u00f7 Product strength (U/vial) \u00d7 Body weight (kg) = Number of vials \n \ne.g. for a 70 kg subject the number of vials for an initial dose will be calculated as follows: \n\n200 U/kg \u00f7 500 U/vial \u00d7 70 kg = 28 vials \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nDosing \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 200 U per kilogram bodyweight, given by injection. \n \n\nType of Bleeding Target Factor VIII \nTrough Activity \n\n(Units per dL or % of \nnormal) \n\nInitial Dose \n(Units per \n\nkg) \n\nSubsequent \nDose \n\nFrequency and \nDuration of \nSubsequent \n\nDosing \nMild and moderate \nsuperficial \nmuscle/no \nneurovascular \ncompromise and \njoint bleeding \n\n>50% \n\n200 \n\nTitrate \nsubsequent \ndoses based on \nclinical \nresponse and \nto maintain \ntarget Factor \nVIII trough \nactivity  \n\nDose \nevery 4 to 12 hours, \nfrequency may be \nadjusted based on \nclinical response \nand measured \nFactor VIII activity Major moderate to \n\nsevere \nintramuscular, \nretroperitoneal, \ngastrointestinal, \nintracranial bleeding \n\n>80% \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
