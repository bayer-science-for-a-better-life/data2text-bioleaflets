This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nMulpleo 3 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 3 mg of lusutrombopag. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nFilm-coated tablet. \n\n \n\nLight red, 7.0 mm round film-coated tablets debossed with the Shionogi trademark above the identifier \n\ncode \u201c551\u201d on one side and debossed on the other side with the strength \u201c3\u201d. \n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nMulpleo is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver \n\ndisease undergoing invasive procedures (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 3 mg lusutrombopag once daily for 7 days. \n\n \n\nThe procedure should be performed from day 9 after the start of lusutrombopag treatment. Platelet \n\ncount should be measured prior to the procedure. \n\n \n\nMissed dose \n\nIf a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible. A double dose should not be taken to make \n\nup for a missed dose.  \n\n \n\nDuration of treatment \n\nMulpleo should not be taken for more than 7 days. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDue to limited information available, the safety and efficacy of Mulpleo in patients with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (Child-Pugh class C) have not been established (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). No dosage \n\nadjustment is expected for these patients. Lusutrombopag therapy should only be initiated in patients \n\nwith severe hepatic impairment if the expected benefit outweighs the expected risks (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 5.2). No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) to moderate \n\n(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of lusutrombopag in children and adolescents (< 18 years of age) have not \n\nbeen established. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nMulpleo is for oral use. The film-coated tablet is to be taken once daily with liquid, swallowed whole \n\nand should not be chewed, divided, or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic complications \n\n \n\nPatients with chronic liver disease have a risk of portal vein thrombosis and mesenteric vein \n\nthrombosis. The risk may be increased due to an invasive procedure. Thromboembolic and thrombotic \n\ncomplications are known to occur with thrombopoetin (TPO) receptor agonists based upon mechanism \n\nof action associated with increases in platelets. Caution should be exercised with respect to \n\nthromboembolic events after invasive procedures as well as post-treatment regardless of platelet \n\ncounts. In patients with thrombosis or thromboembolism, with a history of thrombosis or \n\nthromboembolism, with absence of hepatopetal blood flow in the main trunk of the portal vein, or \n\npatients with congenital coagulopathy the risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism may increase. \n\nThese patients should be clinically monitored when treated with lusutrombopag.  \n\n \n\nSevere hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nThere is limited information on the use of lusutrombopag in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) \n\nhepatic impairment (see section 5.1). Lusutrombopag should only be used in such patients if the \n\nexpected benefit outweighs the expected risks  (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\nDue to the unstable nature of these patients, they should be supported in line with clinical practice by \n\nclose monitoring for early signs of worsening or new onset hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and \n\nthrombotic or bleeding tendency, through monitoring of liver function tests, tests used for assessing \n\nclotting status and through imaging of portal vasculature as needed. In addition, although no dose \n\nadjustment is required in these subjects, platelet count should be measured at least once approximately \n\n5 days after the first dose and as necessary thereafter. Appropriate measures such as discontinuation of \n\nlusutrombopag should be taken, if the platelet count reaches \u226550,000/\u00b5L as a result of a 20,000/\u00b5L \nincrease from baseline. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing invasive procedures \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag should be used when risk for bleeding is considered to be high according to clinical \n\nlaboratory test values such as platelet counts and of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system, clinical \n\nsymptoms and type of invasive procedure. The efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag have not been \n\nestablished when administered before laparotomy, thoracotomy, open-heart surgery, craniotomy or \n\nexcision of organs. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRetreatment \n\n \n\nThere is limited information on the use of lusutrombopag in patients previously exposed to \n\nlusutrombopag. \n\n \n\nUse in patients with a history of splenectomy  \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag have not been established when administered in patients \n\nwith a history of splenectomy. Platelet count should be carefully monitored in patients with a history \n\nof splenectomy treated with lusutrombopag. \n\n \n\nCo-administration with interferon preparations \n\n \n\nInterferon preparations have been known to reduce platelet counts, therefore, this should be considered \n\nwhen co-administering lusutrombopag with interferon preparations. \n\n \n\nPatients with body weight <45 Kg \n\n \n\nThere is limited information on the use of lusutrombopag in patients with body weight <45 Kg. \n\nPlatelet count should be measured at least once approximately 5 days after the first dose and as \n\nnecessary thereafter. Appropriate measures such as discontinuation of lusutrombopag should be taken, \n\nif the platelet count reaches \u226550,000/\u00b5L as a result of a 20,000/\u00b5L increase from baseline. \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nP-gp and BCRP inhibitors \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and \n\nOCT1. In the clinical drug-drug interaction study, co-administration of cyclosporine, a P-gp and \n\nBCRP dual inhibitor, increased the Cmax and AUCinf values of lusutrombopag by approximately 20% \n\ncompared with lusutrombopag administration alone. Therefore, a potential interaction with either P-gp \n\nor BCRP inhibitors cannot be excluded, but no dose adjustment is necessary at the recommended \n\nclinical dosage of 3 mg in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception \n\n \n\nMulpleo should be used with contraception (see sub-section Pregnancy and section 5.3). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of lusutrombopag in pregnant women. Animal \n\nstudies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential not \n\nusing contraception.  \n\n \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether lusutrombopag or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown lusutrombopag is secreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). \n\nTherefore, a risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. Mulpleo should not be administered \n\nto breast-feeding women as it was excreted in mammary milk in animals. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 176 and 252 times the \n\nhuman clinical exposures in adults based on AUC in males and females, respectively (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions were headache (4.7%, 8/171 patients in the lusutrombopag \n\ngroup; 3.5%, 6/170 patients in the placebo group), nausea (2.3%, 4/171 patients in the lusutrombopag \n\ngroup; 4.1%, 7/170 patients in the placebo group), portal vein thrombosis (1.2%, 2/171 patients in the \n\nlusutrombopag group; 1.2%, 2/170 patients in the placebo group) and rash (1.2%, 2/171 patients in the \n\nlusutrombopag group; 0%, 0/170 patients in the placebo group). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions with 3 mg of lusutrombopag once daily for up to 7 days in randomised, double-\n\nblind, placebo-controlled trials in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease undergoing an \n\ninvasive procedure (M0626, M0631 and M0634; N=171) are listed in Table 1 by MedDRA System \n\nOrgan Class. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions  \n\nSystem Organ Class Adverse reaction - Common \n\nNervous system disorders Headache \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Portal vein thrombosis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash \n\na\n Category of frequency: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10)  , uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), \n\nrare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) , and very rare (<1/10,000) \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThrombotic/thromboembolic complications \n\nPortal vein thrombosis has been reported in Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\nclinical studies with 3 mg of lusutrombopag once daily for up to 7 days (1.2%, 2/171 patients); the \n\nincidence was comparable to that of the placebo group (1.2%, 2/170 patients); one case of cardiac \n\nventricular thrombosis was reported (0.6%, 1/171) in the lusutrombopag group only. In the phase 2b \n\nstudy one patient had portal vein thrombosis reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) \n\nin the lusutrombopag 2 mg and 4 mg groups. One patient had mesenteric vein thrombosis reported as a \n\nTEAE in the lusutrombopag 4 mg group; two patients had mesenteric vein thrombosis reported as a \n\nTEAE in the placebo group (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nOverdose may induce an excessive increase of platelet counts, and it may subsequently provoke a \n\nmedically susceptible state to cause thrombosis and thromboembolism. There is no specific antidote \n\nfor lusutrombopag overdose. Platelet counts should be measured frequently and the condition of \n\npatients should be observed closely. Since the protein-binding rate in serum of lusutrombopag is high, \n\nhaemodialysis is not thought to be effective. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics, ATC code: B02BX07 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag is an orally active TPO receptor agonist. Lusutrombopag acts on the haematopoietic \n\nstem cells and on the transmembrane domain of human TPO receptors expressed in megakaryocytes, \n\nto stimulate the megakaryocyte to proliferate and differentiate via the similar signal transduction \n\npathway for up-regulating production used by endogenous TPO, thus leading to thrombocytopoiesis.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nTwo Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to evaluate \n\nlusutrombopag versus placebo in thrombocytopenic (platelet count < 50,000/\u00b5L) subjects with chronic \n\nliver disease (Child-Pugh class A and B), undergoing elective invasive procedures (excluding \n\nlaparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, open-heart surgery, organ resection, or partial organ resection) \n\nin Japan (M0631 (L-PLUS 1)) and multiple countries (M0634 (L-PLUS 2)). Subjects were randomised \n\nto either of 3 mg of lusutrombopag or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by platelet \n\ncount at screening/baseline and primary invasive procedure. Study drug was administered orally for up \n\nto 7 days. On Day 5 to Day 7, the platelet count was measured before administration of study drug. \n\nAdministration of study drug was stopped if the platelet count was \u2265 50,000/\u00b5L together with an \nincrease of \u2265 20,000/\u00b5L from baseline. \n \n\nInvasive procedure was performed between Days 9 and 14. \n\n \n\nIn Study M0631, 96 subjects received lusutrombopag or placebo once daily: 48 subjects in the \n\nlusutrombopag group and 48 subjects in the placebo group. Eight lusutrombopag-treated subjects and \n\n2 placebo-treated subjects received less than 7 days of treatment as they met the criterion for a \n\nresponder prior to Day 7. Among the 48 subjects in the lusutrombopag group, 40 subjects received \n\nlusutrombopag for 7 days, 4 subjects for 6 days, 1 subject for 5 days, and 3 subjects for 4 days. Among \n\nthe 48 subjects in the placebo group, 46 were treated for 7 days and 2 were treated for 4 days. \n\n \n\nIn Study M0634, 215 subjects were randomised in the study: 108 in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group \n\nand 107 in the placebo group. One subject in the lusutrombopag group withdrew from the study prior \n\nto administration of study drug. In the lusutrombopag group, 73/107 subjects (68.2%) received the \n\nstudy drug for 7 days. Of the remaining subjects in the lusutrombopag group, 15, 8, and 11 subjects \n\nreceived study drug for 4, 5, and 6 days, respectively. In the placebo group, 94/107 subjects (87.9%) \n\nreceived the study drug for 7 days. Of the remaining subjects in the placebo group, 5, 4, and 4 subjects \n\nreceived study drug for 4, 5, and 6 days, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint in Study M0631 was the proportion of subjects who required no platelet \n\ntransfusion (i.e. achieved platelet count >50,000/\u00b5L) before the primary invasive procedure. The \n\nprimary endpoint in Study M0634 was the proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion \n\n(i.e. achieved platelet count >50,000/\u00b5L) before the primary invasive procedure and no rescue therapy \n\nfor bleeding from randomisation through 7 days after the primary invasive procedure. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nIn order to allow an overall comparison of the results across Studies M0631 and M0634, as presented \n\nin Table 2 to Table 5, data from study M0631 was reanalysed according to the primary endpoint for \n\nstudy M0634. The proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior to the primary \n\ninvasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomisation through 7 days after the \n\nprimary invasive procedure was statistically significantly greater in the lusutrombopag group \n\ncompared with placebo group for the individual study and pooled analyses (Table 2). \n\n \n\nTable 2 Proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion and no rescue therapy \n\n \n\nStudy M0631 Study M0634 Overall \n\nLUSU 3 mg \n\nN = 49 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN =48 \n\nLUSU 3 mg \n\nN = 108 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN = 107 \n\nLUSU 3 mg \n\nN = 157 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN = 155 \n\nProportion of subjects [a] 75.5% 12.5% 64.8% 29.0% 68.2% 23.9% \n\n(number of subjects) (37) (6) (70) (31) (107) (37) \n\nComparison with placebo \n\n[b]: Difference of \n\nproportion (95% CI) \n\n61.8 \n\n(46.4, 77.2) \n \n\n36.6 \n\n(24.6, 48.5) \n \n\n44.4 \n\n(34.9, 54.0) \n \n\nP value  < 0.0001  < 0.0001  < 0.0001  \n\nLUSU = lusutrombopag \n\n[a] Proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior to the primary invasive procedure and no \n\nrescue therapy (including platelet transfusion) for bleeding from randomisation through 7 days after the primary \n\ninvasive procedure.

All 3 received 7 days of treatment with lusutrombopag. This limited data \n\nsuggested no abnormal pattern of platelet count rise in this subpopulation. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nMulpleo in all subsets of the paediatric population for thrombocytopenia secondary to liver disease \n\n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag is absorbed with a peak concentration occurring 6 to 8 hours after oral administration. \n\nThe accumulation ratios of the Cmax and the AUC are approximately 2 at once-daily multiple doses and \n\nthe steady-state of the plasma concentration of lusutrombopag appear to be achieved after Day 5. The \n\npharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag was similar in both healthy subjects and the chronic liver disease \n\npopulation. The pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with chronic liver disease are shown in \n\nTable 6. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 6  Pharmacokinetic parameters of lusutrombopag after 3 mg dose once daily in \n\nthrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease (Study M0634) \n\nCmax (ng/mL) Tmax (hr) AUC0-\u03c4 (ng\u00b7hr/mL) CL/F (L/hr) \n\n157 (34.7) 5.95 (2.03, 7.85) 2737 (36.1) 1.10 (36.1) \n\nn = 9.  \n\nGeometric mean (%CV) other than for Tmax, which is median (range). \n\n \n\nFood interaction \n\nNeither food (including high-fat and high-calorie diet) nor co-administration with calcium has a \n\nclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nHuman plasma protein binding ratio is \u2265 99.9%. The mean (% coefficient of variation) apparent \nvolume of distribution during the terminal phase of lusutrombopag in healthy adult subjects (n = 16) \n\nwas 39.5 L (23.5%).  \n\n \n\nIn rats, results indicated that lusutrombopag and its metabolites transfer to fetus via placenta. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation  \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or \n\nOCT1. In the human mass balance study using [\n14\n\nC]-lusutrombopag, unchanged lusutrombopag (97% \n\nof radioactivity in plasma) was the major circulating component, and the metabolites, such as \n\ndeshexyl, \u03b2-oxidated carboxylic acid, taurine conjugate of \u03b2-oxidated carboxylic acid, and acyl-\nglucuronide, were detected with less than 2.6% of radioactivity in plasma. In faeces, the components \n\nof radioactivity were unchanged lusutrombopag (16% of administered radioactivity) and \u03b2-oxidation-\nrelated metabolites (35% of administered radioactivity), suggesting that lusutrombopag is metabolised \n\nby \u03c9-oxidation first, and subsequently metabolised by \u03b2-oxidation of O-hexyl side chain. In vitro \nstudies revealed that CYP4 enzymes including CYP4A11 and partially CYP3A4 enzyme contributed \n\nto \u03c9-oxidation to form 6-hydroxylated lusutrombopag. Drug interactions via inhibition and induction \nof any CYP4A enzymes have not been reported in clinical use. Therefore, inducers and inhibitors of \n\nCYP4A enzymes including CYP4A11 are unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag.  \n\nLusutrombopag has low potential to inhibit CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, \n\nand 3A4/5), and to induce both CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A4) and UGT enzymes (UGT1A2, \n\n1A6, and 2B7). Lusutrombopag has also low potential to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, \n\nOCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP. Lusutrombopag is not considered to \n\naffect the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of these \n\nenzymes or transporters. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag was excreted mainly via faecal route in humans (approximately 83% into faeces and \n\n1% into urine). \n\nGeometric mean of t1/2 (% coefficient of variation), was 38.3 hours (18.7%) after multiple oral dose of \n\n3 mg lusutrombopag.  \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity  \n\n \n\nBoth Cmax and AUC for lusutrombopag increase dose-proportionally over dose range of multiple oral \n\ndose of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily in patients with chronic liver disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nPharmacokinetics in subpopulations  \n\n \n\nAge, gender and race \n\nA population pharmacokinetic analysis using plasma lusutrombopag concentrations from clinical \n\nstudies with lusutrombopag did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of age, gender or race on the \n\npharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo pharmacokinetic data have been obtained in children. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nLusutrombopag is rarely excreted into urine (approximately 1%). A population pharmacokinetic \n\nanalysis using plasma lusutrombopag concentrations from clinical studies with lusutrombopag did not \n\nidentify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nMild and moderate hepatic impairment (mild, Child-Pugh class A; moderate, Child-Pugh class B) is \n\nexpected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. The differences in \n\npharmacokinetics of a single 0.75 mg dose of lusutrombopag were relatively small in both subjects \n\nwith mild hepatic impairment and subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, compared with the \n\nhealthy matched control group. Ratios of AUC relative to the healthy matched control group were 1.05 \n\nin subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 1.20 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nThe ranges of observed Cmax and AUC0-\u03c4 overlapped among the patients with Child-Pugh class A, B, \n\nand C. Cmax and AUC0-\u03c4 of all patients with Child-Pugh class C did not exceed the maximum values \n\nfrom Child-Pugh class A and class B. Due to the limited information available, lusutrombopag should \n\nnot be used in Child-Pugh class C patients unless the expected benefit outweighs the expected risks.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in the species used for toxicological testing \n\nbecause of unique human TPO receptor specificity. Thus, the data from the toxicology program in \n\nthese animals do not present potential adverse effects related to exaggerated pharmacology in humans. \n\n \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the \n\nmaximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. \n\n \n\nIn rats, lusutrombopag and its metabolites are excreted in milk, and the concentrations in milk \n\ndecreased as with those in plasma. \n\n \n\nRepeated toxicity \n\n \n\nThe principal toxicity findings associated with lusutrombopag administration included prolongation of \n\nPT and APTT (rats), increased activities of plasma ALT and AST (rats and dogs), adrenal toxicity \n\n(rats and dogs), skin and forestomach lesions (rats) and renal toxicity (rats). \n\n \n\nHigh dose (10 mg/kg/day) and long-term treatment (8 weeks) of lusutrombopag has a potential risk of \n\nfibrosis in the bone marrow via human TPO receptor based on the results of study in TPOR-Ki/Shi \n\nmice with chimeric human transmembrane domain TPO receptor knocked-in to the mouse TPO \n\nreceptor.  \n\n \n\nCarcinogenesis \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag was not carcinogenic to mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in males and females (a \n\ndose at least 45 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on AUC), or rats at doses up to \n\n20 mg/kg/day in males and 2 mg/kg/day in females (a dose 49 and 30 times, respectively, the human \n\nclinical exposures in adults based on AUC). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nMutagenesis \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag was not genotoxic when tested in a bacterial reverse mutation test, a chromosomal \n\naberration test with cultured Chinese hamster lung cells, or an in vivo micronucleus test with mouse \n\nbone marrow cells. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag did not affect male and female fertility and early embryo development in rats at doses \n\nup to 100 mg/kg/day (176 and 252 times respectively, the human clinical exposures in adults based on \n\nAUC). \n\n \n\nEmbryo-foetal development \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag showed no teratogenicity in rats and rabbits at up to 80 mg/kg/day and \n\n1000 mg/kg/day respectively. No effects on foetal viability embryo-foetal development were noted in \n\nrabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (161 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on \n\nAUC). In rats, there were adverse effects of lusutrombopag on foetal intrauterine growth and skeletal \n\nmorphology as follows: a suppression of foetal intrauterine growth (low foetal body weight and a \n\ndecrease in the number of ossified sternebrae) at 80 mg/kg/day, and an high incidence of short cervical \n\nsupernumerary ribs at 40 mg/kg/day or more, and an high incidence of short thoracolumbar \n\nsupernumerary rib at 4 mg/kg/day or more. A suppression of foetal intrauterine growth as well as \n\ncervical ribs occurred at doses (40 mg/kg/day or more), showing maternal toxicity. Meanwhile, the \n\nshort thoracolumbar supernumerary ribs were observed at doses without maternal toxicity. The \n\nchanges were also noted in F1 pups on postnatal day (PND) 4 at 12.5 mg/kg/day or more in the pre- \n\nand postnatal development study; however, F1 mature animals showed no full and short \n\nthoracolumbar supernumerary rib. On the basis of the results, the no observed adverse effect level \n\n(NOAEL) was estimated to be near 4 mg/kg/day in the embryo-foetal development study in rats \n\n(23 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on AUC). \n\n \n\nPre- and post-natal development \n\n \n\nIn the pre- and postnatal development study in rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day, there were adverse \n\neffects of lusutrombopag on postnatal development at 40 mg/kg/day as follow: prolongation of \n\ngestation period in dams, low viability before weaning, delayed postnatal growth such as delayed \n\nnegative geotaxis or delayed eyelid opening, low pup body weight, low female fertility index, a \n\ntendency to low number of corpora lutea or implantations, and a tendency to increased pre-\n\nimplantation loss rate and an abnormal clinical sign such as prominent annular rings on tail after \n\nweaning. There were no effects on pregnancy, parturition, lactation in F0 dams and postnatal \n\ndevelopment in F1 pups at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (89 times the human clinical exposures in \n\nadults based on AUC). \n\n \n\nPhototoxicity \n\n \n\nLusutrombopag has no phototoxic potential in the skin phototoxicity study in hairless mice at doses up \n\nto 500 mg/kg (96.3 \u00b5g/mL) (613 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on Cmax \n\n[0.157 \u00b5g/mL]). \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \n\n \n\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that lusutrombopag has the potential to be very \n\npersistent, very bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n6.

What Mulpleo is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nMulpleo contains the active substance lusutrombopag, which belongs to a group of medicines called \n\nthrombopoietin receptor agonists. The medicine helps to increase the number of platelets in your \n\nblood.
