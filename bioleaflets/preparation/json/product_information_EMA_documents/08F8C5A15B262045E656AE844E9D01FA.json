This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRaxone 150 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg idebenone. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 46 mg of lactose (as monohydrate) and 0.23 mg of sunset yellow FCF \n(E110). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nOrange, round, biconvex film-coated tablet of 10 mm diameter, engraved with the Santhera logo on \none side and ‘150’ on the other side.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRaxone is indicated for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with \nLeber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician with experience in LHON. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose is 900 mg/day idebenone (300 mg, 3 times a day). \n \nNo data regarding a continuous treatment with idebenone beyond 6 months is available from \ncontrolled clinical trials.  \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo specific dose adjustment is required for the treatment of LHON in elderly patients. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \nPatients with hepatic or renal impairment have not been investigated. Caution is advised in treatment \nof patients with hepatic or renal impairment (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Raxone in LHON patients under 12 years of age have not yet been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on \nposology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nRaxone film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with water. The tablets should not be broken \nor chewed. Raxone should be administered with food because food increases the bioavailability of \nidebenone.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nMonitoring \n \nPatients should be regularly monitored according to local clinical practice. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nNo data are available in these populations. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing \nRaxone to patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  \n \nChromaturia \n \nThe metabolites of idebenone are coloured and may cause chromaturia, i.e. a reddish-brown \ndiscoloration of the urine. This effect is harmless, not associated with haematuria, and does not require \nany adaptation of dose or discontinuation of treatment. Caution should be exercised to ensure that the \nchromaturia does not mask changes of colour due to other reasons (e.g. renal or blood disorders).  \n \nLactose \n \nRaxone contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Raxone. \n \nSunset yellow \n \nRaxone contains sunset yellow (E110) which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nData from in vitro studies have demonstrated that idebenone and its metabolite QS10 do not exert \nsystemic inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at \nclinically relevant concentrations of idebenone or QS10. In addition, no induction of CYP1A2, \nCYP2B6 or CYP3A4 was observed. \n \nIn vivo idebenone is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Data from a drug-drug interaction study in \n32 healthy volunteers indicate that on the first day of oral administration of 300 mg idebenone t.i.d., \nthe metabolism of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, was not modified when both medicinal products \nwere administered together. After repeated administration Cmax and AUC of midazolam were increased \nby 28% and 34%, respectively, when midazolam was administered in combination with 300 mg \nidebenone t.i.d. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as \nalfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, \n\n\n\n4 \n\ntacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in \npatients receiving idebenone.  \n \nIdebenone may inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) with possible exposure increases of, e.g., dabigatran \netexilate, digoxin or aliskiren. These medicines should be administered with caution in patients \nreceiving idebenone.  Idebenone is not a substrate for P-gp in vitro. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThe safety of idebenone in pregnant women has not been established. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Idebenone should only be \nadministered to pregnant women or women of child-bearing potential likely to become pregnant if it is \nconsidered that the benefit of the therapeutic effect outweighs any potential risk.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of idebenone in milk \n(for details see 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. . A decision must be made \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Raxone therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no data concerning the effect of exposure to idebenone on human fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRaxone has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions to idebenone are mild to moderate diarrhoea (usually \nnot requiring the discontinuation of the treatment), nasopharyngitis, cough and back pain.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions emerging from clinical trials in LHON patients or reported post-\nmarketing in other indications are tabulated below. Frequency groupings are defined to the following \nconvention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Preferred Term Frequency \nInfections and \nInfestations \n\nNasopharyngitis Very common \nBronchitis Not known \n\nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nAgranulocytosis, anaemia, leukocytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia \n\nNot known \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nBlood cholesterol increased, blood \ntriglycerides increased \n\nNot known \n \n\nNervous system disorders Seizure, delirium, hallucinations, agitation, \ndyskinesia, hyperkinesia, poriomania, \ndizziness, headache, restlessness, stupor \n\nNot known \n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough Very common  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common \nNausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia Not known \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase increased, \naspartate aminotransferase increased, blood \nalkaline phosphatase increased, blood \nlactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma- \nlutamyltransferase increased, blood \nbilirubin increased, hepatitis \n\nNot known \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nRash, pruritus Not known \n \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\nBack pain Common  \nPain in extremity Not known \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\nAzotaemia, chromaturia Not known \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nMalaise Not known \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo report of overdose has been received from the RHODOS study. Doses up to 2,250 mg/day have \nbeen administered in clinical studies showing a safety profile consistent with that reported in \nsection 4.8. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for idebenone. When needed, supportive symptomatic treatment should \nbe given. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics, Other psychostimulants and nootropics;  \nATC code: N06BX13 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIdebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone, is an anti-oxidant assumed to be capable of transferring \nelectrons directly to complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thereby circumventing \ncomplex I and restoring cellular energy (ATP) generation under experimental conditions of complex I \ndeficiency. Similarly, in LHON idebenone can transfer electrons directly to complex III of the electron \ntransport chain, thereby bypassing complex I which is affected by all three primary mtDNA mutations \ncausing LHON, and restoring cellular ATP generation. \n \nAccording to this biochemical mode of action, idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal \nganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients. Depending on the time since symptom onset and the \nproportion of RGCs already affected, idebenone can promote recovery of vision in patients who \nexperience vision loss. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical safety and efficacy of idebenone in LHON have been assessed in one double-blind, \nrandomised, placebo-controlled study (RHODOS).  \n \nIn RHODOS a total of 85 LHON patients, 14-66 years of age, with any of the 3 primary mtDNA \nmutations (G11778A, G3460A or T14484C) and disease duration of not more than 5 years were \nenrolled. Patients received either 900 mg/day Raxone or placebo for a period of 24 weeks (6 months). \nRaxone was given as 3  doses of 300 mg daily, each with meals. \n \nThe primary endpoint “best recovery of visual acuity (VA)” was defined as the result from the eye \nexperiencing the most positive improvement in VA from baseline to week 24 using ETDRS charts. \nThe main secondary endpoint “change in best VA” was measured as the difference between best VA \nin either the left or right eye at 24 weeks compared to baseline (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: RHODOS: Best recovery of VA and change in best VA from baseline to week 24 \n\nEndpoint (ITT) Raxone (N=53) Placebo (N=29) \nPrimary endpoint: \nBest recovery of VA  \n(mean ± SE; 95%CI) \n\nlogMAR* –0.135 ± 0.041 logMAR –0.071 ± 0.053 \nlogMAR –0.064, 3 letters (–0.184; 0.055) \n\np=0.291 \nMain secondary endpoint: \nChange in best VA \n(mean ± SE; 95% CI) \n\nlogMAR –0.035 ± 0.046 logMAR 0.085 ± 0.060 \nlogMAR –0.120, 6 letters (–0.255; 0.014) \n\np=0.078 \nAnalysis according to Mixed Model of Repeated Measures  \nOne patient in the placebo group presented with ongoing spontaneous recovery of vision at baseline. Exclusion of this patient \nyielded similar results as in the ITT population; as could be expected, the difference between idebenone and placebo arm was \nslightly larger. \n*logMAR - Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution \n \nA pre-specified analysis in RHODOS determined the proportion of patients with an eye with baseline \nVA of ≤0.5 logMAR in whom the VA deteriorated to ≥1.0 logMAR. In this small subgroup of patients \n(n=8), 0 of 6 patients in the idebenone group deteriorated to ≥1.0 logMAR whereas 2 of 2 patients in \nthe placebo group showed such a deterioration. \n \nIn a single-visit observational follow-up study of RHODOS VA assessments from 58 patients obtained \non average 131 weeks after discontinuation of treatment indicates that the effect of Raxone may be \nmaintained.  \n \nA post-hoc responder analysis was performed in RHODOS evaluating the proportion of patients who \nhad a clinically relevant recovery of VA from baseline in at least one eye, defined as either: (i) \nimprovement in VA from unable to read a single letter to able to read at least 5 letters on the ETDRS \nchart; or (ii) improvement in VA by at least 10 letters on the ETDRS chart. Results are shown in \nTable 2 including supporting data from 62 LHON patients using Raxone in an Expanded Access \nProgramme (EAP) and from 94 untreated patients in a Case Record Survey (CRS). \n \nTable 2: Proportion of patients with clinically relevant recovery of VA after 6 months from \nbaseline  \n\nRHODOS (ITT) RHODOS Raxone (N=53) RHODOS Placebo (N=29) \n\nResponders (N, %) 16 (30.2 %) 3 (10.3 %) \n\nEAP and CRS EAP-Raxone (N=62)  CRS-untreated (N=94) \n\nResponders (N, %) 19 (30.6 %) 18 (19.1 %) \n \nIn the EAP the number of responders increased with longer treatment duration, from 19 out of 62 \npatients (30.6%) at 6 months to 17 out of 47 patients (36.2%) at 12 months.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nPaediatric population \n \nIn clinical trials in Friedreich’s Ataxia, 32 patients between the ages of 8 and 11 years and 91 patients \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17 years received idebenone at ≥ 900 mg/day for up to 42 months.  \nIn RHODOS and the EAP in LHON, a total of 3 patients between the ages of 9 and 11 years and 27 \npatients between the ages of 12 and 17 years received idebenone at 900 mg/day for up to 33 months. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’.  \nThis means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information \non this medicinal product. \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFood increases the bioavailability of idebenone by approximately 5-7-fold and therefore, Raxone \nshould always be administered with food. The tablets should not be broken or chewed.  \n \nAfter oral administration of Raxone, idebenone is rapidly absorbed. On repeat dosing, maximum \nplasma concentrations of idebenone are reached on average within 1 hour (median 0.67 h range: \n0.33-2.00 h).  \n \nDistribution \n \nExperimental data have shown that idebenone passes the blood-brain barrier and is distributed at \nsignificant concentrations in cerebral tissue. Following oral administration pharmacologically relevant \nconcentrations of idebenone are detectable in the aqueous humor of the eye. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMetabolism occurs by means of oxidative shortening of the side chain and by reduction of the quinone \nring and conjugation to glucuronides and sulphates. Idebenone shows a high first pass metabolism \nresulting in conjugates of idebenone (glucuronides and sulphates (IDE-C)) and the Phase I metabolites \nQS10, QS6, and QS4 as well as their corresponding Phase II metabolites (glucuronides and sulphates \n(QS10+QS10-C, QS6+QS6-C, QS4+QS4-C)). The main metabolites in plasma are IDE-C and \nQS4+QS4-C.  \n \nElimination \n \nDue to the high first-pass effect, the plasma concentrations of idebenone were generally only \nmeasurable up to 6 hours after oral administration of 750 mg Raxone, given either as a single oral dose \nor after repeated (14 days) t.i.d dosing. The main route of elimination is metabolism, with the majority \nof dose excreted via the kidneys as metabolites. After a single or repeated oral dose of 750 mg \nRaxone, QS4+QS4-C were the most prominent idebenone-derived metabolites in urine, representing \non average between 49.3% and 68.3% of the total administered dose. QS6+QS6 represented 6.45% to \n9.46%, whereas QS10+QS10-C and IDE+IDE-C were close to 1% or below. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nIn phase I pharmacokinetic studies, proportional increases in plasma concentrations of idebenone were \nobserved for doses from 150 mg to 1050 mg. Neither idebenone nor its metabolites showed time-\ndependent pharmacokinetics. \n \nHepatic or renal impairment \n \nNo data are available in these populations.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nWhilst clinical trials experience in paediatrics with LHON is limited to patients of 14 years of age and \nabove, pharmacokinetic data from population pharmacokinetic studies, which included paediatric \nFriedreich’s Ataxia patients of age 8 years and above, did not reveal any significant differences in the \npharmacokinetics of idebenone. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n18 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nRaxone 150 mg film-coated tablets \nidebenone \n\n \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Raxone is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take Raxone  \n3. How to take Raxone  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Raxone  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Raxone is and what it is used for \n \nRaxone contains a substance called idebenone.  \n \nIdebenone is used to treat vision impairment in adults and adolescents with an eye disease called \nLeber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON).  \n- This eye problem is inherited – this means it runs in families. \n- It is caused by a problem with your genes (called a “genetic mutation”) that affects the ability of \n\ncells in the eye to produce the energy they need to work normally, so they become inactive. \n- LHON can lead to loss of eyesight due to the inactivity of cells responsible for vision.  \n \nTreatment with Raxone can restore the ability of cells to produce energy and so allow inactive eye \ncells to work again. This can lead to some improvement in lost eyesight.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Raxone  \n \nDo not take Raxone  \n- if you are allergic to idebenone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in  \nsection 6).  \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Raxone if: \n- you have any blood, liver or kidney problems.  \n\n \nChange in urine colour  \nRaxone may make your urine become reddish brown. This change in colour is harmless – it does not \nmean your treatment needs to change. However, the change in colour could mean that you have \n\n\n\n19 \n\nproblems with your kidneys or bladder.  \n- Tell your doctor if your urine changes colour. \n- He or she may do a urine check to make sure the change in colour is not hiding other problems. \n \nTests \nYour doctor will check your eye-sight before you start taking this medicine and then at regular visits \nwhile you are taking it.  \n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children This is because it is not known if Raxone is safe or \nworks in patients under 12 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Raxone \nSome medicines may interact with Raxone. Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or \nmight take any other medicines, especially any of the following: \n- antihistamines to treat allergies (astemizole, terfenadine) \n- to treat heartburn (cisapride) \n- to treat muscle and speech tics associated with Tourette syndrome (pimozide) \n- to treat hearth rhythm disorders (quinidine) \n- to treat migraine (dihydroergotamine, ergotamine) \n- to put you to sleep called “anaesthetics” (alfentanil) \n- to treat inflamation in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis (cyclosporine) \n- to prevent the rejection of an organ transplant (sirolimus, tacrolimus) \n- to treat strong pain called “opioids” (fentanyl) \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n- Your doctor will prescribe Raxone to you only if the benefits of the treatment are greater than \n\nthe risks to the unborn child. \n- Raxone may pass into the mother’s milk. If you are breast-feeding your doctor will discuss with \n\nyou whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop taking the medicine. This will take into account \nthe benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of the medicine for you. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nRaxone is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines.  \n \nRaxone contains lactose and sunset yellow (E110) \n- Raxone contains lactose (a type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an \n\nintolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.. \n- Raxone contains a colourant called “sunset yellow” (also called E110). This may cause allergic \n\nreactions. \n \n \n3. How to take Raxone \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow much to take \nThe recommended dose is 2 tablets three times a day - this is a total of 6 tablets per day.  \n\n \nTaking this medicine \n- Take the tablets with food - this helps to get more of the medicine from your stomach into your \n\nblood. \n- Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of liquid. \n- Do not crush or chew the tablets. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n- Take the tablets at the same time of day each day.
