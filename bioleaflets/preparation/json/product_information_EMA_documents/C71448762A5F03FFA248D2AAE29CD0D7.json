NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nLynparza 50 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains 50 mg of olaparib.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nWhite, opaque, size 0 hard capsule, marked with “OLAPARIB 50 mg” and the AstraZeneca logo in \nblack ink.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nLynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with \nplatinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial \novarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial \nresponse) to platinum-based chemotherapy. \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Lynparza should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products.\n\nPatients must have confirmation of a deleterious or suspected deleterious breast cancer susceptibility \ngene (BRCA) mutation (either germline or tumour) before Lynparza treatment is initiated. BRCA\nmutation status should be determined by an experienced laboratory using a validated test method (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nGenetic counselling for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations should be performed according to local \nregulations.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of Lynparza is 400 mg (eight capsules) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total \ndaily dose of 800 mg. \n\nPatients should start treatment with Lynparza no later than 8 weeks after completion of their final dose \nof the platinum-containing regimen.\n\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or \nunacceptable toxicity. There are no data on retreatment with Lynparza following subsequent relapse \n(see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n3\n\nImportant differences in posology between Lynparza capsules and tablets\nLynparza capsules (50 mg) should not be substituted for Lynparza tablets (100 mg and 150 mg) on a \nmilligram-to-milligram basis due to differences in the dosing and bioavailability of each formulation. \nTherefore, the specific dose recommendations for each formulation should be followed.\n\nMissing dose\nIf a patient misses a dose of Lynparza, they should take their next normal dose at its scheduled time.\n\nDose adjustments for adverse reactions\nTreatment may be interrupted to manage adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and \nanaemia and dose reduction can be considered (see section 4.8).\n\nThe recommended dose reduction is to 200 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of \n400 mg).\n\nIf a further dose reduction is required, then reduction to 100 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily \ndose of 200 mg) is recommended.\n\nDose adjustments for co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors\nConcomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended and alternative agents \nshould be considered. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the recommended \nLynparza dose reduction is to 150 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg). If \na moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the recommended Lynparza dose reduction is \nto 200 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly \nNo adjustment in starting dose is required for elderly patients. There are limited clinical data in \npatients aged 75 years and over. \n\nRenal impairment \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) the recommended \ndose of Lynparza is 300 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg) (see section 5.2). \n\nLynparza can be administered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to \n80 ml/min) with no dose adjustment.\n\nLynparza is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal \ndisease (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min) as safety and pharmacokinetics have not been studied in \nthese patients. Lynparza may only be used in patients with severe renal impairment if the benefit \noutweighs the potential risk, and the patient should be carefully monitored for renal function and \nadverse events. \n\nHepatic impairment \nLynparza can be administered to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclassification A or B) with no dose adjustment (see section 5.2). Lynparza is not recommended for use \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C), as safety and \npharmacokinetics have not been studied in these patients.\n\nNon-Caucasian patients\nThere are limited clinical data available in non-Caucasian patients. However, no dose adjustment is \nrequired on the basis of ethnicity (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Lynparza in children and adolescents has not been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nLynparza is for oral use. \n\nDue to the effect of food on olaparib absorption, patients should take Lynparza at least one hour after \nfood, and refrain from eating preferably for up to 2 hours afterwards. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nBreast-feeding during treatment and 1 month after the last dose (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaematological toxicity \nHaematological toxicity has been reported in patients treated with Lynparza, including clinical \ndiagnoses and/or laboratory findings of generally mild or moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) anaemia, \nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Patients should not start treatment with Lynparza \nuntil they have recovered from haematological toxicity caused by previous anticancer therapy \n(haemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil levels should be ≤CTCAE grade 1). Baseline testing, followed \nby monthly monitoring, of complete blood counts is recommended for the first 12 months of treatment \nand periodically after this time to monitor for clinically significant changes in any parameter during \ntreatment (see section 4.8).\n\nIf a patient develops severe haematological toxicity or blood transfusion dependence, treatment with \nLynparza should be interrupted and appropriate haematological testing should be initiated. If the blood\nparameters remain clinically abnormal after 4 weeks of Lynparza dose interruption, bone marrow \nanalysis and/or blood cytogenetic analysis are recommended. \n\nMyelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia \nThe overall incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) in patients \ntreated in clinical trials with Lynparza monotherapy, including long-term survival follow-up, was \n<1.5% and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The duration of therapy with olaparib in \npatients who developed MDS/AML varied from < 6 months to > 2 years. All patients had potential \ncontributing factors for the development of MDS/AML; having received previous chemotherapy with \nplatinum agents. Many had also received other DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. The majority \nof reports were in germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation carriers. The \nincidence of MDS/AML cases was similar among gBRCA1m and gBRCA2m patients (1.7% and 1.4%, \nrespectively). Some of the patients had a history of previous cancer or of bone marrow dysplasia. If \nMDS and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with Lynparza, it is recommended that Lynparza \nshould be discontinued and the patient be treated appropriately. \n\nPneumonitis \nPneumonitis, including events with a fatal outcome, has been reported in <1.0% of patients treated \nwith Lynparza in clinical studies. Reports of pneumonitis had no consistent clinical pattern and were \nconfounded by a number of pre-disposing factors (cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying \npulmonary disease, smoking history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy). If patients \npresent with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, or an \nabnormal chest radiologic finding is observed, Lynparza treatment should be interrupted and prompt \ninvestigation initiated. If pneumonitis is confirmed, Lynparza treatment should be discontinued and \nthe patient treated appropriately.\n\n\n\n5\n\nEmbryofoetal toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action (PARP inhibition), Lynparza could cause foetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman. Nonclinical studies in rats have shown that olaparib causes adverse \neffects on embryofoetal survival and induces major foetal malformations at exposures below those \nexpected at the recommended human dose of 400 mg twice daily.\n\nPregnancy/contraception\nLynparza should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential must use two forms \nof reliable contraception before starting Lynparza treatment, during therapy and for 1 month after \nreceiving the last dose of Lynparza (see section 4.6). Two highly effective and complementary forms \nof contraception are recommended.\n\nInteractions \nLynparza co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the dose of Lynparza \nshould be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nLynparza co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers is not recommended. In the \nevent that a patient already receiving Lynparza requires treatment with a strong or moderate CYP3A \ninducer, the prescriber should be aware that the efficacy of Lynparza may be substantially reduced \n(see section 4.5).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nClinical studies of olaparib in combination with other anticancer medicinal products, including DNA \ndamaging agents, indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity. The \nrecommended Lynparza monotherapy dose is not suitable for combination with myelosuppressive \nanticancer medicinal products. \n\nCombination of olaparib with vaccines or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. Therefore, \ncaution should be taken if these medicinal products are co-administered with Lynparza and patients \nshould be closely monitored.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nEffect of other medicinal products on olaparib\nCYP3A4/5 are the isozymes predominantly responsible for the metabolic clearance of olaparib. \n\nA clinical study to evaluate the impact of itraconazole, a known CYP3A inhibitor, has shown that co-\nadministration with olaparib increased mean olaparib Cmax by 42% (90% CI: 33-52%) and mean AUC \nby 170% (90% CI: 144-197%). Therefore, known strong (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, \nclarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, boceprevir, telaprevir) or \nmoderate (e.g. erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) inhibitors of this isozyme are not \nrecommended with Lynparza (see section 4.4). If strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be co-\nadministered, the dose of Lynparza should be reduced. The recommended Lynparza dose reduction is\nto 150 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg) with a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor or 200 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg) with a moderate \nCYP3A inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). It is also not recommended to consume grapefruit juice \nwhile on Lynparza therapy as it is a CYP3A inhibitor.\n\nA clinical study to evaluate the impact of rifampicin, a known CYP3A inducer, has shown that \nco-administration with olaparib decreased olaparib mean Cmax by 71% (90% CI: 76-67%) and mean \nAUC by 87% (90% CI: 89-84%). Therefore, known strong inducers of this isozyme (e.g. phenytoin, \nrifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, phenobarbital and St John’s Wort) are not \nrecommended with Lynparza, as it is possible that the efficacy of Lynparza could be substantially \nreduced. The magnitude of the effect of moderate to strong inducers (e.g. efavirenz, rifabutin) on \n\n\n\n6\n\nolaparib exposure is not established, therefore the co-administration of Lynparza with these medicinal \nproducts is also not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nEffect of olaparib on other medicinal products\nOlaparib inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro and is predicted to be a mild CYP3A inhibitor in vivo. Therefore, \ncaution should be exercised when sensitive CYP3A substrates or substrates with a narrow therapeutic \nmargin (e.g. simvastatin, cisapride, cyclosporine, ergot alkaloids, fentanyl, pimozide, sirolimus, \ntacrolimus and quetiapine) are combined with olaparib. Appropriate clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for patients receiving CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic margin \nconcomitantly with olaparib.\n\nInduction of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 has been shown in vitro with CYP2B6 being most likely to be \ninduced to a clinically relevant extent. The potential for olaparib to induce CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and \nP-gp can also not be excluded. Therefore, olaparib upon co-administration may reduce the exposure to \nsubstrates of these metabolic enzymes and transport protein. The efficacy of some hormonal \ncontraceptives may be reduced if co-administered with olaparib (see also sections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\nIn vitro, olaparib inhibits the efflux transporter P-gp (IC50 = 76µM), therefore it cannot be excluded \nthat olaparib may cause clinically relevant drug interactions with substrates of P-gp (e.g. simvastatin, \npravastatin, dabigatran, digoxin and colchicine). Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended for \npatients receiving this type of medicinal product concomitantly.\n\nIn vitro, olaparib has been shown to be an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, \nMATE1 and MATE2K. It cannot be excluded that olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of \nBCRP (e.g. methotrexate, rosuvastatin), OATP1B1 (e.g. bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, statins \nand valsartan), OCT1 (e.g. metformin), OCT2 (e.g. serum creatinine), OAT3 (e.g. furosemide and \nmethotrexate), MATE1 (e.g. metformin) and MATE2K (e.g. metformin). In particular, caution should \nbe exercised if olaparib is administered in combination with any statin. \n\nCombination with anastrozole, letrozole and tamoxifen\nA clinical study has been performed to assess the combination of olaparib with anastrozole, letrozole \nor tamoxifen. No significant interaction was observed with anastrozole or letrozole whereas tamoxifen \ndecreased exposure to olaparib by 27%. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. Olaparib \ndoes not affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females\nWomen of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while on Lynparza and not be pregnant \nat the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing \npotential prior to treatment and considered regularly throughout treatment. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use two forms of reliable contraception before starting \nLynparza therapy, during therapy and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of Lynparza, unless \nabstinence is the chosen method of contraception (see section 4.4). Two highly effective and \ncomplementary forms of contraception are recommended.\n\nSince it cannot be excluded that olaparib may reduce exposure to substrates of CYP2C9 through \nenzyme induction, the efficacy of some hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-administered \nwith olaparib. Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should be considered \nduring treatment (see section 4.5). For women with hormone dependent cancer, two non-hormonal \ncontraceptive methods should be considered.\n\nPregnancy\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including serious teratogenic effects and effects \non embryofoetal survival in the rat at maternal systemic exposures lower than those in humans at \n\n\n\n7\n\ntherapeutic doses (see section 5.3). There are no data from the use of olaparib in pregnant women, \nhowever, based on the mode of action of olaparib, Lynparza should not be used during pregnancy and \nin women of childbearing potential not using reliable contraception during therapy and for 1 month \nafter receiving the last dose of Lynparza. (See previous paragraph: “Women of childbearing \npotential/contraception in females” for further information about birth control and pregnancy testing.)\n\nBreast-feeding\nThere are no animal studies on the excretion of olaparib in breast milk. It is unknown whether olaparib\nor its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Lynparza is contraindicated during breast-feeding and \nfor 1 month after receiving the last dose, given the pharmacologic property of the product (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nFertility\nThere are no clinical data on fertility. In animal studies, no effect on conception was observed but \nthere are adverse effects on embryofoetal survival (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLynparza has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who take Lynparza \nmay experience fatigue, asthenia or dizziness. Patients who experience these symptoms should \nobserve caution when driving or using machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nLynparza monotherapy has been associated with adverse reactions generally of mild or moderate \nseverity (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. The most \nfrequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving Lynparza \nmonotherapy (≥ 10%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anaemia, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, \nheadache, dysgeusia, neutropenia, cough, dyspnoea, dizziness, dyspepsia, leukopenia,\nthrombocytopenia and upper abdominal pain.\n\nThe Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of patients were anaemia (16%), neutropenia (6%),\nfatigue/asthenia (6%), leukopenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%) and vomiting (2%).\n\nAdverse reactions that most commonly led to dose interruptions and/ or reductions were anaemia \n(14.9%), vomiting (7.2%), nausea (6.5%), fatigue/asthenia (6.2%) and neutropenia (6.2%). Adverse \nreactions that most commonly led to permanent discontinuation were anaemia (1.2%), nausea (0.7%), \nthrombocytopenia (0.6%) and vomiting (0.6%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety profile is based on pooled data from 2095 patients with solid tumours treated with \nLynparza monotherapy in clinical trials at the recommended dose.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in clinical trials with patients receiving Lynparza\nmonotherapy where patient exposure is known. Adverse drug reactions are listed by MedDRA System \nOrgan Class (SOC) and then by MedDRA preferred term in Table 1. Within each SOC, preferred \nterms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of \noccurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common ( 1/100 to < 1/10); \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data).\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 1 Tabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nAdverse reactions\n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nClass\n\nFrequency of All CTCAE grades Frequency of CTCAE grade 3 \nand above \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nVery common\nAnaemiaa, Neutropeniaa, \nThrombocytopeniaa, Leukopeniaa\n\nCommon\nLymphopeniaa\n\nVery common\nAnaemiaa\n\nCommon\nNeutropeniaa, \nThrombocytopeniaa, \nLeukopeniaa\n\nUncommon\nLymphopeniaa\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nCommon\nRasha\n\nUncommon\nHypersensitivitya, Dermatitisa\n\n-\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nVery common \nDecreased appetite\n\nUncommon\nDecreased appetite\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nVery common\n\nDizziness, Headache, Dysgeusia\n\nUncommon\nDizziness, Headache\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nVery common\nCougha, Dyspnoeaa\n\nCommon\n\nDyspnoeaa\n\nUncommon\nCougha\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nVery common\nVomiting, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Dyspepsia,\nUpper abdominal pain\n\nCommon\nStomatitisa\n\nCommon\nVomiting, Diarrhoea, Nausea\n\nUncommon\nStomatitisa, Upper abdominal \npain \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nVery common\nFatigue (including asthenia) \n\nCommon\nFatigue (including asthenia)\n\nInvestigations Common\n\nBlood creatinine increased\n\nUncommon \nMean cell volume increased\n\nUncommon \nBlood creatinine increased\n\na Anaemia includes preferred terms (PTs) of anaemia, anaemia macrocytic, erythropenia, haematocrit \ndecreased, haemoglobin decreased, normochromic anaemia, normochromic normocytic anaemia, \nnormocytic anaemia and red blood cell count decreased; Neutropenia includes PTs of agranulocytosis, \nfebrile neutropenia, granulocyte count decreased, granulocytopenia, idiopathic neutropenia, neutropenia, \nneutropenic infection, neutropenic sepsis and neutrophil count decreased; Thrombocytopenia includes \nPTs of platelet count decreased, platelet production decreased, plateletcrit decrease and \nthrombocytopenia; Leukopenia includes PTs of leukopenia and white blood cell count decreased; \nLymphopenia includes PTs of B-lymphocyte count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, lymphopenia\n\n\n\n9\n\nand T-lymphocyte count decreased; Cough includes PTs of cough and productive cough; Rash includes \nPTs of exfoliative rash, generalised erythema, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash macular, \nrash maculo-papular, rash papular and rash pruritic; Hypersensitivity includes PTs of drug \nhypersensitivity and hypersensitivity; Dermatitis includes PTs of dermatitis, dermatitis allergic and \ndermatitis exfoliative.

Anaemia was the most common \nCTCAE grade ≥3 adverse reaction reported in clinical studies. Median time to first onset of anaemia \nwas approximately 4 weeks (approximately 7 weeks for CTCAE grade ≥ 3 events). Anaemia was \nmanaged with dose interruptions and dose reductions (see section 4.2), and where appropriate with \nblood transfusions. In Study 19, the incidence of anaemia was 22.8% (CTCAE grade ≥3 7.4%) and the \nincidences of dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations for anaemia were 2.9%, 5.1% and \n0%, respectively; 16.2% of patients treated with olaparib needed one or more blood transfusions \nduring the treatment. An exposure-response relationship between olaparib and decreases in \nhaemoglobin has been demonstrated. In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade \n≥2 shifts (decreases) from baseline in haemoglobin was 20%, absolute neutrophils 20%, platelets 5%, \nlymphocytes 30% and leucocytes 20% (all % approximate). \n\nThe incidence of elevations in mean corpuscular volume from low or normal at baseline to above the \nULN was approximately 55%. Levels appeared to return to normal after treatment discontinuation and \ndid not appear to have any clinical consequences. \n\nBaseline testing, followed by monthly monitoring of complete blood counts is recommended for the \nfirst 12 months of treatment and periodically after this time to monitor for clinically significant \nchanges in any parameter during treatment which may require dose interruption or reduction and/or \nfurther treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nOther laboratory findings\nIn clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥2 shifts (elevations) from baseline in \nblood creatinine was approximately 10%. Data from a double-blind placebo-controlled study showed \nmedian increase up to 23% from baseline remaining consistent over time and returning to baseline \nafter treatment discontinuation, with no apparent clinical sequelae. 90% of patients had creatinine \nvalues of CTCAE grade 0 at baseline and 10% were CTCAE grade 1 at baseline.\n\nGastrointestinal toxicities\nNausea was generally reported very early, with first onset within the first month of Lynparza treatment \nin the majority of patients. Vomiting was reported early, with first onset within the first two months of \nLynparza treatment in the majority of patients. Both nausea and vomiting were reported to be \nintermittent for the majority of patients and can be managed by dose interruption, dose reduction \nand/or antiemetic therapy. Antiemetic prophylaxis is not required.\n\nPaediatric population\nNo studies have been conducted in paediatric patients.\n\nOther special populations\nLimited safety data are available in elderly (age  75 years) and non-Caucasian patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n10\n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms of overdose are not established and there is no specific treatment in the event of Lynparza\noverdose. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and \nshould treat the patient symptomatically.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX46\n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects\nOlaparib is a potent inhibitor of human poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2 \nand PARP-3), and has been shown to inhibit the growth of selected tumour cell lines in vitro and \ntumour growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established \nchemotherapies. \n\nPARPs are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of \nPARP-induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto-modifies itself and \ndissociates from the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. When olaparib \nis bound to the active site of DNA-associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and traps it \non the DNA, thus blocking repair. In replicating cells this leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) \nwhen replication forks meet the PARP-DNA adduct. In normal cells, homologous recombination \nrepair (HRR), which requires functional BRCA1 and 2 genes, is effective at repairing these DNA \nDSBs. In the absence of functional BRCA1 or 2, DNA DSBs cannot be repaired via HRR. Instead, \nalternative and error-prone pathways are activated, such as the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) \npathway, leading to increased genomic instability. After a number of rounds of replication, genomic \ninstability can reach insupportable levels and result in cancer cell death, as cancer cells have a high \nDNA damage load relative to normal cells. \n\nIn BRCA-deficient in vivo models, olaparib given after platinum treatment resulted in a delay in \ntumour progression and an increase in overall survival compared to platinum treatment alone.\n\nDetection of BRCA mutation\nLocal or central testing of blood or tumour samples for BRCA1/2 mutations has been used in different \nstudies. Depending on the test used and the international classification consensus, the BRCA1/2\nmutations have been classified as deleterious/suspected deleterious or pathogenic/likely pathogenic. \nGenetic testing should be conducted by an experienced laboratory using a validated test.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n11\n\nClinical efficacy \nThe safety and efficacy of olaparib as a maintenance therapy in the treatment of platinum-sensitive \nrelapsed (PSR) high grade serous ovarian, including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer \npatients, following treatment with two or more platinum-containing regimens, were studied in a Phase \nII randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (study 19). The study compared the efficacy of \nolaparib maintenance treatment taken until progression with no maintenance treatment in 265 (136 \nolaparib and 129 placebo) PSR serous ovarian cancer patients who were in response (CR [complete \nresponse] or PR [partial response]) confirmed as per RECIST and/or as per CA-125 criteria as defined \nby Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) (at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from the last \npre-treatment sample, confirmed 28 days later) following completion of two or more previous \nplatinum-containing chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was PFS (progression-free survival) based \non investigator assessment using RECIST 1.0. Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS (overall \nsurvival), DCR (disease control rate) defined as confirmed CR/PR + SD (stable disease), HRQoL \n(health related quality of life), and disease related symptoms. Exploratory analyses of time to first \nsubsequent therapy or death (TFST) and time to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST- an \napproximation of PFS2) were also performed. \n\nOnly PSR patients with partially platinum-sensitive disease (platinum-free interval of 6 to 12 months) \nand patients with platinum-sensitive disease (platinum-free interval of >12 months) who were in \nresponse following completion of last platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients could not \nhave received prior olaparib or other PARP inhibitor treatment. Patients could have received prior \nbevacizumab, except in the regimen immediately prior to randomisation. Retreatment with olaparib \nwas not permitted following progression on olaparib. Most patients were ECOG performance status 0 \n(77%), there are no data in patients with performance status 2 to 4.\n\nPatients were randomised into the study a median of 40 days after completing their final platinum \nchemotherapy. They received an average of 3 previous chemotherapy regimens (range 2-11) and \n2.6 previous platinum-containing chemotherapies (range 2-8). Platinum-free interval was > 12 months \nin 60% and 6-12 months in 40% of the patients. Response to prior platinum chemotherapy was \ncomplete in 45% and partial in 55% of the patients. In the olaparib and placebo arms, 6% and 5% of \npatients had prior bevacizumab, respectively.\n\nPatients in the olaparib group continued to receive treatment longer than those in the placebo group. A \ntotal of 32 (23.5%) patients received treatment for ≥2 years in the olaparib group compared with 5 \n(3.9%) patients in the placebo group. A total of 18 (13.2%) patients received treatment for ≥5 years in \nthe olaparib group compared with 1 (0.8%) patient in the placebo group.\n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS for \nolaparib compared with placebo in the overall population with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.35 (95% CI \n0.25-0.49; p<0.00001; median 8.4 months olaparib versus 4.8 months placebo). At the final OS\nanalysis (data cut off [DCO] 9 May 2016) at 79% maturity, the HR comparing olaparib with placebo \nwas 0.73 (95% CI 0.55-0.95; p=0.02138 [did not meet pre-specified significance level of <0.0095]; \nmedian 29.8 months olaparib versus 27.8 months placebo). \n\nPre-planned subgroup analysis by BRCA-mutation status identified patients with BRCA-mutated \novarian cancer (n=136, 51.3%) as the subgroup that derived the greatest clinical benefit from olaparib \nmaintenance monotherapy. Enrolment did not require evidence of BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCA mutation \nstatus for some patients was determined retrospectively). There are limited data in patients with \nsomatic BRCA mutated tumours; 10 patients in the olaparib arm and 10 patients in the placebo arm \nwere defined as having somatic BRCA1/2 mutation. There was no strategy for multiple testing in place \nfor the sub-group analyses.\n\nIn BRCA-mutated patients (n=136) there was a statistically significant improvement in PFS, TFST and \nTSST. The median PFS improvement was 6.9 months over placebo for olaparib-treated patients (HR \n0.18; 95% CI 0.10-0.31; p<0.00001; median 11.2 months versus 4.3 months). The investigator \nassessment of PFS was consistent with a blinded independent central radiological review of PFS. At \nthe final analysis (DCO 9 May 2016), the time from randomisation to start of first subsequent therapy \n\n\n\n12\n\nor death (TFST) was 9.4 months longer for olaparib-treated patients (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.22–0.49; \np<0.00001; median 15.6 months versus 6.2 months). The time from randomisation to start of second \nsubsequent therapy or death (TSST) was 6.1 months longer for olaparib-treated patients (HR 0.43; \n95% CI 0.29-0.64; p=0.00003; median 21.4 months versus 15.3 months). For the secondary endpoint \nof OS, the HR for olaparib versus placebo was 0.62 (95% CI 0.42-0.93; p=0.02140; median \n34.9 months versus 30.2 months) (Table 2). In the olaparib-treated group, 28.4% of patients remained \non treatment for ≥2 years and 14.9% for ≥5 years. In the placebo-treated group, 8.1% of patients \nremained on treatment for ≥2 years and 1.6% for ≥5 years. Within the BRCA-mutated population the \ndisease control rate at 24 weeks was 57% and 24% for patients in the olaparib and placebo groups, \nrespectively.\n\nNo statistically significant differences were observed between olaparib and placebo in patient reported \nsymptoms or HRQoL as measured by improvement and worsening rates in the FACT/NCCN Ovarian \nSymptom Index (FOSI), Trial Outcome Index (TOI) and Functional Analysis of Cancer Therapy–\nOvarian total score (FACT-O total). \n\nThe key efficacy findings from Study 19 for BRCA-mutated patients are presented in Table 2, and \nFigures 1 and 2. \n\nTable 2 Summary of key efficacy findings for patients with BRCA-mutated PSR ovarian cancer in \nStudy 19\n\nPFS (DCO 30 June \n2010)\n\nN\n(events/patients) \n\n(%)\n\nMedian PFS \n(months)\n\nHRa 95% CI p-value* \n\n(2-sided)\n\nOlaparib 400 mg bd 26/74 (35) 11.2\n0.18 0.10-0.31 <0.00001\n\nPlacebo 46/62 (74) 4.3\n\nTSST- an \napproximation of \nPFS2 (DCO 09 May \n2016)\n\nN Median \nTSST \n\n(months)\n\nHRa 95% CI p-value* \n\n(2-sided)\n\nOlaparib 400 mg bd 53/74 (72) 21.4\n0.43 0.29-0.64 0.00003\n\nPlacebo 56/62 (90) 15.3\n\nOS (73% maturity) \n(DCO 09 May 2016)\n\nN Median OS \n(months) HR\n\na 95% CI\np-value* \n\n(2-sided)\n\nOlaparib 400 mg bd 49/74 (66) 34.9 \n0.62 0.42-0.93 0.02140\n\nPlacebob 50/62 (81) 30.2\n\n* There was no strategy for multiple testing in place for the sub-group analyses.\na HR= Hazard Ratio.

On multiple dosing there \nis no marked accumulation, with steady state exposures achieved within ~3 to 4 days. \n\nCo-administration with food slowed the rate (tmax delayed by 2 hours) and marginally increased the \nextent of absorption of olaparib (AUC increased by approximately 20%). Therefore, it is \nrecommended that patients take Lynparza at least one hour after food, and refrain from eating \npreferably for up to 2 hours afterwards (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nThe in vitro protein binding is approximately 82% at clinically relevant concentrations of 10 µg/mL.\n\nIn vitro, human plasma protein binding of olaparib was dose-dependent; the fraction bound was \napproximately 91% at 1 µg/mL, reducing to 82% at 10 µg/mL and to 70% at 40 µg/mL. In solutions of \npurified proteins, the olaparib fraction bound to albumin was approximately 56%, which was \nindependent of olaparib concentrations. Using the same assay, the fraction bound to alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein was 29% at 10 µg/mL with a trend of decreased binding at higher concentrations.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro, CYP3A4/5 were shown to be the enzymes primarily responsible for the metabolism of \nolaparib (see section 4.5).\n\nFollowing oral dosing of 14C-olaparib to female patients, unchanged olaparib accounted for the \nmajority of the circulating radioactivity in plasma (70%) and was the major component found in both \nurine and faeces (15% and 6% of the dose, respectively). The metabolism of olaparib is extensive. The \nmajority of the metabolism was attributable to oxidation reactions with a number of the components \n\n\n\n15\n\nproduced undergoing subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Up to 20, 37 and 20 metabolites \nwere detected in plasma, urine and faeces respectively, the majority of them representing <1% of the \ndosed material. A ring-opened piperazin-3-ol moiety, and two mono-oxygenated metabolites (each \n~10%) were the major circulating components, with one of the mono-oxygenated metabolites also \nbeing the major metabolite in the excreta (6% and 5% of the urinary and faecal radioactivity,\nrespectively). \n\nIn vitro, olaparib produced little/no inhibition of UGT1A4, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or CYPs 1A2, 2A6, \n2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 2E1 and is not expected to be a clinically significant time dependent \ninhibitor of any of these CYP enzymes. Olaparib inhibited UGT1A1 in vitro, however, PBPK \nsimulations suggest this is not of clinical importance. In vitro, olaparib is a substrate of the efflux \ntransporter P-gp, however this is unlikely to be of clinical significance (see section 4.5).\n\nIn vitro, data also show that olaparib is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, BCRP or \nMRP2, and is not an inhibitor of OATP1B3, OAT1 or MRP2.\n\nElimination\nFollowing a single dose of 14C-olaparib, ~86% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7-day \ncollection period, ~44% via the urine and ~42% via the faeces. Majority of the material was excreted \nas metabolites. \n\nSpecial populations\nIn population based PK analyses, patient age, bodyweight or race (including White and Japanese \npatients) were not significant covariates.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min), AUC increased by 24% \nand Cmax by 15% compared with patients with normal renal function. No Lynparza dose adjustment is \nrequired for patients with mild renal impairment.\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min), AUC increased by \n44% and Cmax by 26% compared with patients with normal renal function. Lynparza dose adjustment \nis recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nThere are no data in patients with severe impairment or end-stage renal disease (creatinine \nclearance <30 ml/min).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A), AUC increased by 15% and \nCmax by 13% and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification B), AUC \nincreased by 8% and Cmax decreased by 13% compared with patients with normal hepatic function. No \nLynparza dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.2). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclassification C).\n\nPaediatric population\nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of olaparib in paediatric patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nGenotoxicity\nOlaparib showed no mutagenic potential, but was clastogenic in mammalian cells in vitro. When \ndosed orally to rats, olaparib induced micronuclei in bone marrow. This clastogenicity is consistent \nwith the known pharmacology of olaparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in man.\n\n\n\n16\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 6 months duration in rats and dogs, daily oral doses of olaparib \nwere well-tolerated. The major primary target organ for toxicity in both species was the bone marrow, \nwith associated changes in peripheral haematology parameters. These changes were reversible within \n4 weeks of cessation of dosing. In rats, minimal degenerative effects on gastrointestinal tract were also \nnoted. These findings occurred at exposures below those seen clinically. Studies using human bone \nmarrow cells also showed that direct exposure to olaparib can result in toxicity to bone marrow cells in \nex vivo assays.\n\nReproductive toxicology\nIn a female fertility study where rats were dosed until implantation, although extended oestrus was \nobserved in some animals, mating performance and pregnancy rate was not affected. However, there \nwas a slight reduction in embryofoetal survival.\n\nIn rat embryofoetal development studies, and at dose levels that did not induce significant maternal \ntoxicity, olaparib caused reduced embryofoetal survival, reduced foetal weight and foetal \ndevelopmental abnormalities, including major eye malformations (e.g. anophthalmia, \nmicrophthalmia), vertebral/rib malformation and visceral and skeletal abnormalities. \n\nCarcinogenicity\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with olaparib.\n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nOvarian cancer\nLynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the:\n\n maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA1/2-\nmutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary \nperitoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line \nplatinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial \novarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) \nto platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n\n\n19\n\nBreast cancer\nLynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA1/2-\nmutations, who have HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients should \nhave previously been treated with an anthracycline and a taxane in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic \nsetting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments (see section 5.1).\n\nPatients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should also have progressed on or after \nprior endocrine therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine therapy.\n\nAdenocarcinoma of the pancreas\nLynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with germline \nBRCA1/2-mutations who have metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and have not progressed \nafter a minimum of 16 weeks of platinum treatment within a first-line chemotherapy regimen.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Lynparza should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products.\n\nDetection of BRCA1/2 mutations\n\nFirst-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer:\nBefore Lynparza treatment is initiated for first-line maintenance treatment of high-grade epithelial \novarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC) or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), patients must \nhave confirmation of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline and/or somatic mutations in the \nbreast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA) 1 or 2 using a validated test.\n\nMaintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer:\nThere is no requirement for BRCA1/2 testing prior to using Lynparza for the maintenance treatment of \nrelapsed EOC, FTC or PPC who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based therapy.\n\ngBRCA1/2-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer:\nFor germline breast cancer susceptibility genes (gBRCA1/2) mutated human epidermal growth factor \nreceptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, patients must have \nconfirmation of a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA1/2 mutation before Lynparza treatment \nis initiated. gBRCA1/2 mutation status should be determined by an experienced laboratory using a \nvalidated test method. Data demonstrating clinical validation of tumour BRCA1/2 tests in breast cancer \nare not currently available.\n\nFirst-line maintenance treatment of gBRCA-mutated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas:\nFor first-line maintenance treatment of germline BRCA1/2-mutated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the \npancreas, patients must have confirmation of a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA1/2 \nmutation before Lynparza treatment is initiated. gBRCA1/2 mutation status should be determined by \nan experienced laboratory using a validated test method. Data demonstrating clinical validation of \ntumour BRCA1/2 tests in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas are not currently available.\n\nGenetic counselling for patients tested for mutations in BRCA1/2 genes should be performed \naccording to local regulations.\n\nPosology\n\nLynparza is available as 100 mg and 150 mg tablets.\n\nThe recommended dose of Lynparza is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a \ntotal daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction.\n\n\n\n20\n\nPatients with platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or \nprimary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy\nshould start treatment with Lynparza no later than 8 weeks after completion of their final dose of the \nplatinum-containing regimen. \n\nDuration of treatment\n\nFirst-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer:\nPatients can continue treatment until radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or for up \nto 2 years if there is no radiological evidence of disease after 2 years of treatment. Patients with \nevidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating physician can derive further benefit \nfrom continuous treatment, can be treated beyond 2 years.\n\nMaintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer:\nFor patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary \nperitoneal cancer, it is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying \ndisease or unacceptable toxicity.\n\ngBRCA1/2-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer:\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or \nunacceptable toxicity. \n\nFirst-line maintenance treatment of gBRCA-mutated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas:\nIt is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or \nunacceptable toxicity. \n\nThere are no efficacy or safety data on maintenance retreatment with Lynparza following first or \nsubsequent relapse in ovarian cancer patients or on retreatment of breast cancer patients (see \nsection 5.1).\n\nImportant differences in posology between Lynparza tablets and capsules \nLynparza tablets (100 mg and 150 mg) should not be substituted for Lynparza capsules (50 mg) on a \nmilligram-to-milligram basis due to differences in the dosing and bioavailability of each formulation. \nTherefore, the specific dose recommendations for each formulation should be followed.\n\nMissing dose\nIf a patient misses a dose of Lynparza, they should take their next normal dose at its scheduled time.\n\nDose adjustments for adverse reactions\nTreatment may be interrupted to manage adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and \nanaemia and dose reduction can be considered (see section 4.8).\n\nThe recommended dose reduction is to 250 mg (one 150 mg tablet and one 100 mg tablet) twice daily \n(equivalent to a total daily dose of 500 mg).\n\nIf a further dose reduction is required, then reduction to 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets) twice daily \n(equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg) is recommended.\n\nDose adjustments for co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors\nConcomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended and alternative agents \nshould be considered. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the recommended \nLynparza dose reduction is to 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet) taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily \ndose of 200 mg). If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the recommended Lynparza \ndose reduction is to 150 mg (one 150 mg tablet) taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of \n300 mg) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\n\n\n21\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly \nNo adjustment in starting dose is required for elderly patients. There are limited clinical data in \npatients aged 75 years and over. \n\nRenal impairment \nFor patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) the recommended \ndose of Lynparza is 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets) twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of \n400 mg) (see section 5.2). \n\nLynparza can be administered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to \n80 ml/min) with no dose adjustment.\n\nLynparza is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal \ndisease (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min), as safety and pharmacokinetics have not been studied in \nthese patients. Lynparza may only be used in patients with severe renal impairment if the benefit \noutweighs the potential risk, and the patient should be carefully monitored for renal function and \nadverse events. \n\nHepatic impairment \nLynparza can be administered to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nclassification A or B) with no dose adjustment (see section 5.2). Lynparza is not recommended for use \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C), as safety and \npharmacokinetics have not been studied in these patients. \n\nNon-Caucasian patients\nThere are limited clinical data available in non-Caucasian patients. However, no dose adjustment is \nrequired on the basis of ethnicity (see section 5.2). \n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Lynparza in children and adolescents have not been established. \nNo data are available.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nLynparza is for oral use.\n\nLynparza tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided. Lynparza \ntablets may be taken without regard to meals.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nBreast-feeding during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose (see section 4.6).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nHaematological toxicity \nHaematological toxicity has been reported in patients treated with Lynparza, including clinical \ndiagnoses and/or laboratory findings of generally mild or moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) anaemia, \nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Patients should not start treatment with Lynparza \nuntil they have recovered from haematological toxicity caused by previous anticancer therapy \n(haemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil levels should be ≤CTCAE grade 1). Baseline testing, followed \nby monthly monitoring, of complete blood counts is recommended for the first 12 months of treatment \n\n\n\n22\n\nand periodically after this time to monitor for clinically significant changes in any parameter during \ntreatment (see section 4.8).\n\nIf a patient develops severe haematological toxicity or blood transfusion dependence, treatment with \nLynparza should be interrupted and appropriate haematological testing should be initiated. If the blood \nparameters remain clinically abnormal after 4 weeks of Lynparza dose interruption, bone marrow \nanalysis and/or blood cytogenetic analysis are recommended. \n\nMyelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia \nThe overall incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) in patients \ntreated in clinical trials with Lynparza monotherapy, including long-term survival follow-up, was \n<1.5% and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The duration of therapy with olaparib in \npatients who developed MDS/AML varied from <6 months to >2 years; data with longer durations of \nexposure are limited. All patients had potential contributing factors for the development of \nMDS/AML, having received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents. Many had also received \nother DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. The majority of reports were in germline breast cancer \nsusceptibility gene 1 or 2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation carriers. The incidence of MDS/AML cases was \nsimilar among gBRCA1m and gBRCA2m patients (1.7% and 1.4%, respectively). Some of the patients \nhad a history of previous cancer or of bone marrow dysplasia. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed \nwhile on treatment with Lynparza, it is recommended that Lynparza should be discontinued and the \npatient be treated appropriately.\n\nPneumonitis \nPneumonitis, including events with a fatal outcome, has been reported in <1.0% of patients treated \nwith Lynparza in clinical studies. Reports of pneumonitis had no consistent clinical pattern and were \nconfounded by a number of pre-disposing factors (cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying \npulmonary disease, smoking history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy). If patients \npresent with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, or an \nabnormal chest radiologic finding is observed, Lynparza treatment should be interrupted and prompt \ninvestigation initiated. If pneumonitis is confirmed, Lynparza treatment should be discontinued and \nthe patient treated appropriately.\n\nEmbryofoetal toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action (PARP inhibition), Lynparza could cause foetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman. Nonclinical studies in rats have shown that olaparib causes adverse \neffects on embryofoetal survival and induces major foetal malformations at exposures below those \nexpected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg twice daily.\n\nPregnancy/contraception\nLynparza should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential must use two forms \nof reliable contraception before starting Lynparza treatment, during therapy and for 1 month after \nreceiving the last dose of Lynparza. Two highly effective and complementary forms of contraception \nare recommended. Male patients and their female partners of childbearing potential should use reliable \ncontraception during therapy and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of Lynparza (see \nsection 4.6).\n\nInteractions \nLynparza co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, the dose of Lynparza \nshould be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).\n\nLynparza co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers is not recommended. In the \nevent that a patient already receiving Lynparza requires treatment with a strong or moderate CYP3A \ninducer, the prescriber should be aware that the efficacy of Lynparza may be substantially reduced \n(see section 4.5).\n\n\n\n23\n\nSodium\n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg or 150 mg tablet, that is \nto say essentially “sodium-free”.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\nClinical studies of olaparib in combination with other anticancer medicinal products, including DNA \ndamaging agents, indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity. The \nrecommended Lynparza monotherapy dose is not suitable for combination with myelosuppressive \nanticancer medicinal products.\n\nCombination of olaparib with vaccines or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. Therefore, \ncaution should be taken if these medicinal products are co-administered with Lynparza and patients \nshould be closely monitored.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\nEffect of other medicinal products on olaparib\nCYP3A4/5 are the isozymes predominantly responsible for the metabolic clearance of olaparib.\n\nA clinical study to evaluate the impact of itraconazole, a known CYP3A inhibitor, has shown that \nco-administration with olaparib increased mean olaparib Cmax by 42% (90% CI: 33-52%) and mean \nAUC by 170% (90% CI: 144-197%). Therefore, known strong (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, \nclarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, boceprevir, telaprevir) or \nmoderate (e.g. erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) inhibitors of this isozyme are not \nrecommended with Lynparza (see section 4.4). If strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be \nco-administered, the dose of Lynparza should be reduced. The recommended Lynparza dose reduction \nis to 100 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 200 mg) with a strong CYP3A \ninhibitor or 150 mg taken twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg) with a moderate \nCYP3A inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). It is also not recommended to consume grapefruit juice \nwhile on Lynparza therapy as it is a CYP3A inhibitor.\n\nA clinical study to evaluate the impact of rifampicin, a known CYP3A inducer, has shown that \nco-administration with olaparib decreased olaparib mean Cmax by 71% (90% CI: 76-67%) and mean \nAUC by 87% (90% CI: 89-84%). Therefore, known strong inducers of this isozyme (e.g. phenytoin, \nrifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, phenobarbital and St John’s Wort) are not \nrecommended with Lynparza, as it is possible that the efficacy of Lynparza could be substantially \nreduced. The magnitude of the effect of moderate to strong inducers (e.g. efavirenz, rifabutin) on \nolaparib exposure is not established, therefore the co-administration of Lynparza with these medicinal \nproducts is also not recommended (see section 4.4).\n\nEffect of olaparib on other medicinal products\nOlaparib inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro and is predicted to be a mild CYP3A inhibitor in vivo. Therefore, \ncaution should be exercised when sensitive CYP3A substrates or substrates with a narrow therapeutic \nmargin (e.g. simvastatin, cisapride, cyclosporine, ergot alkaloids, fentanyl, pimozide, sirolimus, \ntacrolimus and quetiapine) are combined with olaparib. Appropriate clinical monitoring is \nrecommended for patients receiving CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic margin \nconcomitantly with olaparib.\n\nInduction of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 has been shown in vitro with CYP2B6 being most likely to be \ninduced to a clinically relevant extent. The potential for olaparib to induce CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and \nP-gp can also not be excluded. Therefore, olaparib upon co-administration may reduce the exposure to \nsubstrates of these metabolic enzymes and transport protein. The efficacy of some hormonal \ncontraceptives may be reduced if co-administered with olaparib (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).\n\n\n\n24\n\nIn vitro, olaparib inhibits the efflux transporter P-gp (IC50 = 76 µM), therefore it cannot be excluded \nthat olaparib may cause clinically relevant drug interactions with substrates of P-gp (e.g. simvastatin, \npravastatin, dabigatran, digoxin and colchicine). Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended for \npatients receiving this type of medicinal product concomitantly.\n\nIn vitro, olaparib has been shown to be an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, \nMATE1 and MATE2K. It cannot be excluded that olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of \nBCRP (e.g. methotrexate, rosuvastatin), OATP1B1 (e.g. bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, statins \nand valsartan), OCT1 (e.g. metformin), OCT2 (e.g. serum creatinine), OAT3 (e.g. furosemide and \nmethotrexate), MATE1 (e.g. metformin) and MATE2K (e.g. metformin). In particular, caution should \nbe exercised if olaparib is administered in combination with any statin. \n\nCombination with anastrozole, letrozole and tamoxifen\nA clinical study has been performed to assess the combination of olaparib with anastrozole, letrozole \nor tamoxifen. No significant interaction was observed with anastrozole or letrozole, whereas \ntamoxifen decreased exposure to olaparib by 27%. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. \nOlaparib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females\nWomen of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while on Lynparza and not be pregnant \nat the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing \npotential prior to treatment and considered regularly throughout treatment. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use two forms of reliable contraception before starting \nLynparza therapy, during therapy and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of Lynparza, unless \nabstinence is the chosen method of contraception (see section 4.4). Two highly effective and \ncomplementary forms of contraception are recommended.\n\nSince it cannot be excluded that olaparib may reduce exposure to substrates of CYP2C9 through \nenzyme induction, the efficacy of some hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-administered \nwith olaparib. Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should be considered \nduring treatment (see section 4.5). For women with hormone dependent cancer, two non-hormonal \ncontraceptive methods should be considered.\n\nContraception in males \nIt is not known whether olaparib or its metabolites are found in seminal fluid. Male patients must use a \ncondom during therapy and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of Lynparza when having sexual \nintercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of \nmale patients must also use highly effective contraception if they are of childbearing potential (see \nsection 4.4). Male patients should not donate sperm during therapy and for 3 months after receiving \nthe last dose of Lynparza. \n\nPregnancy\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including serious teratogenic effects and effects \non embryofoetal survival in the rat at maternal systemic exposures lower than those in humans at \ntherapeutic doses (see section 5.3). There are no data from the use of olaparib in pregnant women, \nhowever, based on the mode of action of olaparib, Lynparza should not be used during pregnancy and \nin women of childbearing potential not using reliable contraception during therapy and for 1 month \nafter receiving the last dose of Lynparza. (See previous paragraph: “Women of childbearing \npotential/contraception in females” for further information about birth control and pregnancy testing.)\n\n\n\n25\n\nBreast-feeding\nThere are no animal studies on the excretion of olaparib in breast milk. It is unknown whether olaparib\nor its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Lynparza is contraindicated during breast-feeding and \nfor 1 month after receiving the last dose, given the pharmacologic property of the product (see \nsection 4.3). \n\nFertility\nThere are no clinical data on fertility. In animal studies, no effect on conception was observed but \nthere are adverse effects on embryofoetal survival (see section 5.3). \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nLynparza has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients who take Lynparza \nmay experience fatigue, asthenia or dizziness. Patients who experience these symptoms should \nobserve caution when driving or using machines. \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nLynparza monotherapy has been associated with adverse reactions generally of mild or moderate \nseverity (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. The most \nfrequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving Lynparza \nmonotherapy (≥ 10%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, anaemia, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, \nheadache, dysgeusia, neutropenia, cough, dyspnoea, dizziness, dyspepsia, leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia and upper abdominal pain.\n\nThe Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of patients were anaemia (16%), neutropenia (6%),\nfatigue/asthenia (6%), leukopenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%) and vomiting (2%).\n\nAdverse reactions that most commonly led to dose interruptions and/ or reductions were anaemia \n(14.9%), vomiting (7.2%), nausea (6.5%), fatigue/asthenia (6.2%) and neutropenia (6.2%). Adverse \nreactions that most commonly led to permanent discontinuation were anaemia (1.2%), nausea (0.7%), \nthrombocytopenia (0.6%) and vomiting (0.6%).\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nThe safety profile is based on pooled data from 2095 patients with solid tumours treated with \nLynparza monotherapy in clinical trials at the recommended dose.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in clinical trials with patients receiving Lynparza\nmonotherapy where patient exposure is known. Adverse drug reactions are listed by MedDRA System \nOrgan Class (SOC) and then by MedDRA preferred term in Table 1. Within each SOC, preferred \nterms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of \noccurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from available data).\n\n\n\n26\n\nTable 1 Tabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nAdverse reactions\n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ \nClass\n\nFrequency of All CTCAE grades Frequency of CTCAE grade 3 \nand above \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem disorders\n\nVery common\nAnaemiaa, Neutropeniaa, \nThrombocytopeniaa, Leukopeniaa\n\nCommon\nLymphopeniaa\n\nVery common\nAnaemiaa\n\nCommon\nNeutropeniaa, \nThrombocytopeniaa, \nLeukopeniaa\n\nUncommon\nLymphopeniaa\n\nImmune system \ndisorders\n\nCommon\nRasha\n\nUncommon\nHypersensitivitya, Dermatitisa\n\n-\n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition \ndisorders\n\nVery common \nDecreased appetite\n\nUncommon\nDecreased appetite\n\nNervous system \ndisorders\n\nVery common\nDizziness, Headache, Dysgeusia \n\nUncommon\nDizziness, Headache\n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders\n\nVery common\nCougha, Dyspnoeaa\n\nCommon\n\nDyspnoeaa\n\nUncommon\nCougha\n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders\n\nVery common\nVomiting, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Dyspepsia,\nUpper abdominal pain\n\nCommon\nStomatitisa\n\nCommon\nVomiting, Diarrhoea, Nausea\n\nUncommon\nStomatitisa, Upper abdominal \npain\n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions\n\nVery common\nFatigue (including asthenia) \n\nCommon\nFatigue (including asthenia)\n\nInvestigations Common\nBlood creatinine increased\n\nUncommon \nMean cell volume increased\n\nUncommon \nBlood creatinine increased\n\na Anaemia includes preferred terms (PTs) of anaemia, anaemia macrocytic, erythropenia, haematocrit decreased, \n\nhaemoglobin decreased, normochromic anaemia, normochromic normocytic anaemia, normocytic anaemia and red \n\nblood cell count decreased; Neutropenia includes PTs of agranulocytosis, febrile neutropenia, granulocyte count \n\ndecreased, granulocytopenia, idiopathic neutropenia, neutropenia, neutropenic infection, neutropenic sepsis and \n\nneutrophil count decreased; Thrombocytopenia includes PTs of platelet count decreased, platelet production \n\ndecreased, plateletcrit decreased and thrombocytopenia; Leukopenia includes PTs of leukopenia and white blood cell \n\ncount decreased; Lymphopenia includes PTs of B-lymphocyte count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased,\n\n\n\n27\n\nlymphopenia and T-lymphocyte count decreased; Cough includes PTs of cough and productive cough; Rash includes \n\nPTs of exfoliative rash, generalised erythema, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash macular, rash \n\nmaculo-papular, rash papular and rash pruritic; Hypersensitivity includes PTs of drug hypersensitivity and\n\nhypersensitivity; Dermatitis includes PTs of dermatitis, dermatitis allergic and dermatitis exfoliative.

Anaemia was the most common \nCTCAE grade ≥3 adverse reaction reported in clinical studies. Median time to first onset of anaemia \nwas approximately 4 weeks (approximately 7 weeks for CTCAE grade ≥3 events). Anaemia was \nmanaged with dose interruptions and dose reductions (see section 4.2), and where appropriate with \nblood transfusions. In clinical studies with the tablet formulation, the incidence of anaemia adverse \nreactions was 38.8% (CTCAE grade ≥3 17.4%) and the incidences of dose interruptions, reductions\nand discontinuations for anaemia were 15.7%, 10.8% and 1.9%, respectively; 20.9% of patients \ntreated with olaparib needed one or more blood transfusions. An exposure-response relationship \nbetween olaparib and decreases in haemoglobin has been demonstrated. In clinical studies with \nLynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 shifts (decreases) from baseline in haemoglobin was \n20%, absolute neutrophils 20%, platelets 5%, lymphocytes 30% and leucocytes 20% (all % \napproximate).\n\nThe incidence of elevations in mean corpuscular volume from low or normal at baseline to above the \nULN was approximately 55%. Levels appeared to return to normal after treatment discontinuation and \ndid not appear to have any clinical consequences.\n\nBaseline testing, followed by monthly monitoring of complete blood counts is recommended for the \nfirst 12 months of treatment and periodically after this time to monitor for clinically significant \nchanges in any parameter during treatment which may require dose interruption or reduction and/or \nfurther treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nOther laboratory findings\nIn clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 shifts (elevations) from baseline \nin blood creatinine was approximately 10%. Data from a double-blind placebo-controlled study \nshowed median increase up to 23% from baseline remaining consistent over time and returning to \nbaseline after treatment discontinuation, with no apparent clinical sequelae. 90% of patients had \ncreatinine values of CTCAE grade 0 at baseline and 10% were CTCAE grade 1 at baseline.\n\nGastrointestinal toxicities\nNausea was generally reported very early, with first onset within the first month of Lynparza treatment \nin the majority of patients. Vomiting was reported early, with first onset within the first two months of \nLynparza treatment in the majority of patients. Both nausea and vomiting were reported to be \nintermittent for the majority of patients and can be managed by dose interruption, dose reduction \nand/or antiemetic therapy. Antiemetic prophylaxis is not required.\n\nIn first-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment, patients experienced nausea events (77% on \nolaparib, 38% on placebo), vomiting (40% on olaparib, 15% on placebo), diarrhoea (34% on olaparib, \n25% on placebo) and dyspepsia (17% on olaparib, 12% on placebo). Nausea events led to \ndiscontinuation in 2.3% of olaparib-treated patients (CTCAE Grade 2) and 0.8% of placebo-treated \npatients (CTCAE Grade 1); 0.8% and 0.4% of olaparib-treated patients discontinued treatment due to \nlow grade (CTCAE Grade 2) vomiting and dyspepsia, respectively. No olaparib or placebo-treated \npatients discontinued due to diarrhoea. No placebo-treated patients discontinued due to vomiting or \ndyspepsia. Nausea events led to dose interruption and dose reductions in 14% and 4%, respectively, of \n\n\n\n28\n\nolaparib-treated patients. Vomiting events led to interruption in 10% of olaparib-treated patients; no \nolaparib-treated patients experienced a vomiting event leading to dose reduction. \n\nPaediatric population\nNo studies have been conducted in paediatric patients.\n\nOther special populations\nLimited safety data are available in elderly (age  75 years) and non-Caucasian patients.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere is limited experience of overdose with olaparib. No unexpected adverse reactions were reported \nin a small number of patients who took a daily dose of up to 900 mg of olaparib tablets over two days. \nSymptoms of overdose are not established and there is no specific treatment in the event of Lynparza\noverdose. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and \nshould treat the patient symptomatically.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX46\n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects\nOlaparib is a potent inhibitor of human poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2, \nand PARP-3), and has been shown to inhibit the growth of selected tumour cell lines in vitro and \ntumour growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established \nchemotherapies. \n\nPARPs are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of \nPARP-induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto-modifies itself and \ndissociates from the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. When olaparib \nis bound to the active site of DNA-associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and traps it \non the DNA, thus blocking repair. In replicating cells this also leads to the formation of DNA \ndouble-strand breaks (DSBs) when replication forks meet the PARP-DNA adducts. In normal cells, \nhomologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway is effective at repairing these DNA DSBs. In \ncancers that lack functional components of HRR such as BRCA1 or 2, DNA DSBs cannot be repaired \naccurately or effectively. Instead, alternative and error-prone pathways are activated, such as the \nclassical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, leading to increased genomic instability. \nAfter a number of rounds of replication, genomic instability can reach insupportable levels and result \nin cancer cell death, as cancer cells already have a high DNA damage load relative to normal cells. In \nthe absence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, HRR pathway may be compromised by other \nmechanisms, although the causative aberrancy and penetrance are not fully elucidated. Absence of \nfully functional HRR pathway is one of the key determinants of platinum sensitivity in ovarian and \nother cancers.\n\nIn BRCA1/2-deficient in vivo models, olaparib given after platinum treatment resulted in a delay in \ntumour progression and an increase in overall survival compared to platinum treatment alone that \ncorrelated with the period of olaparib maintenance treatment.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n29\n\nDetection of BRCA1/2 mutations\nLocal or central testing of blood and/or tumour samples for BRCA1/2 mutations have been used in \ndifferent studies. Depending on the test used and the international classification consensus, the \nBRCA1/2 mutations have been classified as deleterious/suspected deleterious or pathogenic/likely \npathogenic. Genetic testing should be conducted by an experienced laboratory using a validated test.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nFirst-line maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer:\nSOLO1 Study\n\nThe safety and efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy were studied in patients with newly \ndiagnosed advanced (FIGO Stage III-IV) high-grade serous or endometrioid BRCA1/2 mutated \n(BRCA1/2m) ovarian cancer following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in a \nPhase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. In this study 391 patients \nwere randomised 2:1 to receive either Lynparza (300 mg [2 x 150 mg tablets] twice daily) or placebo.\nPatients were stratified by response to first-line platinum chemotherapy; complete response (CR) or \npartial response (PR). Treatment was continued until radiological progression of the underlying \ndisease, unacceptable toxicity or for up to 2 years. For patients who remained in complete clinical \nresponse (i.e. no radiological evidence of disease), the maximum duration of treatment was 2 years; \nhowever, patients who had evidence of disease that remained stable (i.e. no evidence of disease \nprogression) could continue to receive Lynparza beyond 2 years.\n\nPatients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations were identified prospectively either from \ngermline testing in blood via a local test (n=208) or central test (n=181) or from testing a tumour \nsample using a local test (n=2). By central germline testing, deleterious or suspected deleterious \nmutations were identified in 95.3% (365/383) and 4.7% (18/383) of patients, respectively. Large \nrearrangements in the BRCA1/2 genes were detected in 5.5% (21/383) of the randomised patients. The \ngBRCAm status of patients enrolled via local testing was confirmed retrospectively by central testing. \nRetrospective testing of patients with available tumour samples was performed using central testing \nand generated successful results in 341 patients, of which 95% had an eligible mutation (known \n[n=47] or likely pathogenic [n=277]) and 2 gBRCAwt patients were confirmed to have sBRCAm only.\nThere were 389 patients who were germline BRCA1/2m and 2 who were somatic BRCA1/2m in \nSOLO1.\n\nDemographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the olaparib and \nplacebo treatment arms. Median age was 53 years in both arms. Ovarian cancer was the primary \ntumour in 85% of the patients. The most common histological type was serous (96%), endometrioid \nhistology was reported in 2% of the patients. Most patients were ECOG performance status 0 (78%), \nthere are no data in patients with performance status 2 to 4. Sixty-three percent (63%) of the patients \nhad upfront debulking surgery and of these the majority (75%) had no macroscopic residual disease. \nInterval debulking surgery was performed in 35% of the patients and of these 82% had no \nmacroscopic residual disease reported. Seven patients, all stage IV, had no cytoreductive surgery. All \npatients had received first-line platinum-based therapy. There was no evidence of disease at study \nentry (CR), defined by the investigator as no radiological evidence of disease and cancer antigen 125 \n(CA-125) within normal range, in 73% and 77% of patients in the olaparib and placebo arms, \nrespectively. PR, defined as the presence of any measurable or non-measurable lesions at baseline or \nelevated CA-125, was reported in 27% and 23% of patients in the olaparib and placebo arms, \nrespectively. Ninety three percent (93%) of patients were randomised within 8 weeks of their last dose \nof platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who had been treated with bevacizumab were excluded \nfrom the study, therefore there are no safety and efficacy data on olaparib patients who had previously \nreceived bevacizumab. There are very limited data in patients with a somatic BRCA mutation.\n\nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) defined as time from randomisation to \nprogression determined by investigator assessment using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in \n\n\n\n30\n\nSolid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, or death. Secondary efficacy endpoints included time from \nrandomisation to second progression or death (PFS2), overall survival (OS), time from randomisation \nto discontinuation of treatment or death (TDT), time from randomisation to first subsequent anti-\ncancer therapy or death (TFST) and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients had tumour \nassessments at baseline and every 12 weeks for 3 years, and then every 24 weeks relative to date of \nrandomisation, until objective radiological disease progression.\n\nThe study demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in investigator \nassessed PFS for olaparib compared to placebo. The investigator assessment of PFS was supported \nwith a blinded independent central radiological (BICR) review of PFS. At the time of PFS analysis, \ninterim OS data were immature (21%), with HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.60, 1.53; p-value=0.9).

At 24 and 36 months, respectively, 68% and 45% \npatients remained in CR in the olaparib arm, and 34% and 22% of patients in the placebo arm. Patients \nwith PR at study entry had PFS HR 0.31 (95% CI 0.18, 0.52; median PFS 30.9 months on olaparib vs \n8.4 months on placebo). Patients with PR at study entry either achieved CR (15% in olaparib arm and \n4% in the placebo arm at 24 months, remained in CR at 36 months) or had further PR/stable disease \n(43% in olaparib arm and 15% in the placebo arm at 24 months; 17% in olaparib arm and 15% in \nplacebo arm at 36 months). The proportion of patients who progressed within 6 months of the last dose \nof platinum-based chemotherapy was 3.5% for olaparib and 8.4% for placebo.\n\nMaintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian cancer\nSOLO2 Study\nThe safety and efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy were studied in a Phase III randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutated PSR ovarian, \nfallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. The study compared the efficacy of Lynparza maintenance \ntreatment (300 mg [2 x 150 mg tablets] twice daily) taken until progression with placebo treatment in \n295 patients with high-grade serous or endometrioid PSR ovarian cancer (2:1 randomisation: 196 \nolaparib and 99 placebo) who were in response (CR or PR) following completion of \nplatinum-containing chemotherapy. \n\nPatients who have received two or more platinum-containing regimens and whose disease had \nrecurred >6 months after completion of penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled. \nPatients could not have received prior olaparib or other PARP inhibitor treatment. Patients could have \nreceived prior bevacizumab, except in the regimen immediately prior to randomisation. \n\nAll patients had evidence of gBRCA1/2m at baseline. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations were identified \neither from germline testing in blood via a local test or by central testing at Myriad or from testing a \ntumour sample using a local test. Large rearrangements in the BRCA1/2 genes were detected in 4.7% \n(14/295) of the randomised patients.\n\nDemographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the olaparib and \nplacebo arms. Median age was 56 years in both arms. Ovarian cancer was the primary tumour in \n>80% of the patients. The most common histological type was serous (> 90%), endometrioid histology \nwas reported in 6% of the patients. In the olaparib arm 55% of the patients had only 2 prior lines of \ntreatment with 45% receiving 3 or more prior lines of treatment. In the placebo arm 61% of patients \nhad received only 2 prior lines with 39% receiving 3 or more prior lines of treatment. Most patients \nwere ECOG performance status 0 (81%), there are no data in patients with performance status 2 to 4. \nPlatinum-free interval was >12 months in 60% and >6-12 months in 40% of the patients. Response to \nprior platinum chemotherapy was complete in 47% and partial in 53% of the patients. In the olaparib \nand placebo arms, 17% and 20% of patients had prior bevacizumab, respectively.\n\nThe primary endpoint was PFS determined by investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1. Secondary \nefficacy endpoints included PFS2; OS, TDT, TFST, TSST; and HRQoL.\n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in \ninvestigator assessed PFS for olaparib compared with placebo with a HR of 0.30 (95% CI 0.22-0.41; \np<0.0001; median 19.1 months olaparib vs 5.5 months placebo). The investigator assessment of PFS \nwas supported with a blinded independent central radiological review of PFS (HR 0.25; 95% CI \n0.18-0.35; p<0.0001; median 30.2 months for olaparib and 5.5 months placebo).

Of patients treated \nwith Lynparza, who entered the study with evidence of disease (target or non-target lesions at \nbaseline), 15.0% experienced complete response compared with 9.1% of patients on placebo.\n\nAt the time of the analysis of PFS the median duration of treatment was 19.4 months for olaparib and \n5.6 months for placebo. The majority of patients remained on the 300 mg bd starting dose of olaparib. \nThe incidence of dose interruptions, reductions, discontinuations due to an adverse event was 45.1%,\n25.1% and 10.8%, respectively. Dose interruptions occurred most frequently in the first 3 months and \ndose reductions in the first 3-6 months of treatment. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to \ndose interruption or dose reduction were anaemia, nausea and vomiting.\n\nPatient-reported outcome (PRO) data indicate no difference for the olaparib-treated patients as \ncompared to placebo as assessed by the change from baseline in the TOI of the FACT-O.\n\nStudy 19 (D0810C00019) \n\nThe safety and efficacy of olaparib as a maintenance therapy in the treatment of PSR ovarian, \nincluding fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer patients, following treatment with two or more \nplatinum-containing regimens, were studied in a large Phase II randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial (Study 19). The study compared the efficacy of Lynparza capsule maintenance \ntreatment (400 mg [8 x 50 mg capsules] twice daily) taken until progression with placebo treatment in \n265 (136 olaparib and 129 placebo) PSR high grade serous ovarian cancer patients who were in \nresponse (CR or PR) following completion of platinum-containing chemotherapy. The primary \nendpoint was PFS based on investigator assessment using RECIST 1.0. Secondary efficacy endpoints \nincluded OS, disease control rate (DCR) defined as confirmed CR/PR + SD (stable disease), HRQoL \nand disease related symptoms. Exploratory analyses of TFST and TSST were also performed.\n\nPatients whose disease had recurred >6 months after completion of penultimate platinum-based \nchemotherapy were enrolled. Enrolment did not require evidence of BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCA\nmutation status for some patients was determined retrospectively). Patients could not have received \nprior olaparib or other PARP inhibitor treatment. Patients could have received prior bevacizumab, \nexcept in the regimen immediately prior to randomisation. Retreatment with olaparib was not \npermitted following progression on olaparib.\n\n\n\n35\n\nPatients with BRCA1/2 mutations were identified either from germline testing in blood via a local test \nor by central testing at Myriad or from testing a tumour sample using a test performed by Foundation \nMedicine. Large rearrangements in the BRCA1/2 genes were detected in 7.4% (10/136) of the \nrandomised patients.\n\nDemographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the olaparib and \nplacebo arms. Median age was 59 years in both arms. Ovarian cancer was the primary tumour in 86% \nof the patients. In the olaparib arm 44% of the patients had only 2 prior lines of treatment with 56% \nreceiving 3 or more prior lines of treatment. In the placebo arm 49% of patients had received only 2 \nprior lines with 51% receiving 3 or more prior lines of treatment. Most patients were ECOG \nperformance status 0 (77%), there are no data in patients with performance status 2 to 4. Platinum-free \ninterval was > 12 months in 60% and 6-12 months in 40% of the patients. Response to prior platinum \nchemotherapy was complete in 45% and partial in 55% of the patients. In the olaparib and placebo \narms, 6% and 5% of patients had prior bevacizumab, respectively.\n\nThe study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS for \nolaparib compared with placebo in the overall population with a HR of 0.35 (95% CI 0.25-0.49; \np<0.00001; median 8.4 months olaparib vs 4.8 months placebo). At the final OS analysis (data cut off \n[DCO] 9 May 2016) at 79% maturity, the hazard ratio comparing olaparib with placebo was 0.73 \n(95% CI 0.55-0.95; p=0.02138 [did not meet pre-specified significance level of <0.0095]; median \n29.8 months olaparib versus 27.8 months placebo). In the olaparib-treated group, 23.5% (n=32/136) of \npatients remained on treatment for ≥2 years as compared with 3.9% (n=5/128) of the patients on \nplacebo. Although patient numbers were limited, 13.2% (n=18/136) of the patients in the\nolaparib-treated group remained on treatment for ≥5 years as compared with 0.8% (n=1/128) in the \nplacebo group.\n\nPreplanned subgroup analysis identified patients with BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer (n=136, \n51.3%; including 20 patients identified with a somatic tumour BRCA1/2 mutation) as the subgroup \nthat derived the greatest clinical benefit from olaparib maintenance monotherapy. A benefit was also \n\nobserved in patients with BRCA1/2 wild-type/variants of uncertain significance (BRCA1/2 wt/VUS), \n\nalthough of a lesser magnitude.

In this study 302 patients with a documented deleterious or suspected deleterious \ngBRCA mutation were randomised 2:1 to receive either Lynparza (300 mg [2 x 150 mg tablets] twice \ndaily) or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine 42%, eribulin 35%, or vinorelbine 17%)\nuntil progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations were identified from \ngermline testing in blood via a local test or by central testing at Myriad. Patients were stratified based \non: receipt of prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer (yes/no), hormone receptor\n(HR) positive vs triple negative (TNBC), prior platinum treatment for breast cancer (yes/no). The \nprimary endpoint was PFS assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST 1.1. \nSecondary endpoints included PFS2, OS, objective response rate (ORR) and HRQoL.\n\nPatients must have received treatment with an anthracycline unless contraindicated and a taxane in \neither a (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting.

Patients received either Lynparza 300 mg (2 x \n150 mg tablets) twice daily (n=92) or placebo (n=62) until radiological disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity. Patients should have not progressed during first-line platinum-based \nchemotherapy and should have received a minimum of 16 weeks of continuous platinum treatment,\nwhich could be discontinued at any time thereafter for unacceptable toxicity while the remaining\nagents continued according to the planned regimen or unacceptable toxicity for other component(s). \nPatients who could tolerate complete platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen until progression \nhave not been considered for this study. The maintenance therapy was started 4 to 8 weeks after the \nlast dose of first-line chemotherapy component(s) in the absence of progression and if all toxicities\nfrom previous anti-cancer therapy had been resolved to CTCAE grade 1, except for alopecia, grade 3 \nperipheral neuropathy and Hgb ≥ 9 g/dL.\n\nThirty-one percent (31%) of patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations were identified from prior \nlocal testing results and 69% of patients by central testing. In the olaparib arm, 32% of patients carried \na germline BRCA1 mutation, 64% a germline BRCA2 mutation and 1% carried both germline BRCA1\nand germline BRCA2 mutations. In the placebo arm, 26% of patients carried a germline BRCA1\nmutation, 73% a germline BRCA2 mutation and no patients carried both germline BRCA1 and \n\n\n\n44\n\ngermline BRCA2 mutations. The BRCAm status of all patients identified using prior local testing \nresults was confirmed, where sent, by central testing. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of patients carried a \ndeleterious mutation and 2% carried a suspected deleterious mutation. Large rearrangements in the \nBRCA1/2 genes were detected in 5.2 % (8/154) of the randomised patients.\n\nDemographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the olaparib and \nplacebo arms. Median age was 57 years in both arms; 30% of patients in the olaparib arm were ≥ 65 \nyears compared to 20% in the placebo arm. Fifty-eight per-cent (58%) of patients in the olaparib arm \nand 50% of patients in the placebo arm were male. In the olaparib arm 89% of patients were White \nand 11% were non-White; in the placebo arm 95% of patients were White and 5% were non-White. \nMost patients were ECOG performance status 0 (71% in the olaparib arm and 61% in the placebo \narm). Overall, the sites of metastasis prior to chemotherapy were liver 72%, lung 10% and other sites \n50%. The median time from original diagnosis to randomisation across both arms was 6.9 months \n(range 3.6 to 38.4 months).\n\nOverall, 75% of patients received FOLFIRINOX with a median of 9 cycles (range 4-61), 8% received \nFOLFOX or XELOX, 4% received GEMOX, and 3% received gemcitabine plus cisplatin; the \nremaining 10% of patients received other chemotherapy regimens. Duration of the first-line \nchemotherapy for metastatic disease was 4 to 6 months, >6 to <12 months and ≥12 months, \nrespectively, in 77%, 19% and 4% of patients in the olaparib arm and in 80%, 17% and 3% in the \nplacebo arm, with around 1 month from the last dose of the first-line chemotherapy component(s) to \nthe start of study treatment in both arms. As best response on first-line chemotherapy, 7% of olaparib \npatients and 5% of placebo patients had a complete response, 44% of olaparib patients and 44% of \nplacebo patients had a partial response and 49% of olaparib and 50% of placebo patients had stable \ndisease. At randomisation, measurable disease was reported in 85% and 84% of patients in the \nolaparib or placebo arms, respectively. The median time from initiation of the first-line platinum-\nbased chemotherapy to randomisation was 5.7 months (range 3.4 to 33.4 months).\n\nAt DCO, 33% of patients in the olaparib arm and 13% on the placebo arm remained on study \ntreatment. Forty-nine percent of patients (49%) in the olaparib arm and 74% in the placebo arm \nreceived subsequent therapy. Forty-two percent (42%) of patients in the olaparib arm and 55% in the \nplacebo arm received platinum as subsequent therapy. One percent (1%) of patients in the olaparib \narm and 15% in the placebo arm received PARP inhibitor as subsequent therapy. Of the 33 (36%) and \n28 (45%) of patients who received a first subsequent platinum-containing therapy, in the olaparib and \nplacebo arms, stable disease was reported in 8 vs 6 patients, whereas 1 vs 2 patients had responses, \nrespectively.\n\nThe primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomisation to \n\nprogression determined by BICR using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1\n\nmodified to assess patients with no evidence of disease, or death. Secondary efficacy endpoints \n\nincluded overall survival (OS), time from randomisation to second progression or death (PFS2), time \n\nfrom randomisation to first subsequent anti-cancer therapy or death (TFST), objective response rate \n\n(ORR), duration of response (DoR), response rate, time to response and health related quality of life \n\n(HRQoL). \n\nThe study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for olaparib compared to \n\nplacebo (Table 9). The BICR assessment of PFS was consistent with an investigator assessment.\n\nAt the interim analysis of OS (46% maturity) the HR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.56 – 1.46; p=0.6833; median \n18.9 months for olaparib vs 18.1 months for placebo) which did not reach statistical significance. The \nHR for PFS2 (47% maturity, not controlled for multiplicity) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.46 – 1.23; p=0.2597; \nmedian 13.2 months for olaparib vs 9.2 months for placebo).\n\n\n\n45\n\nTable 9 Efficacy results for patients with gBRCAm metastatic adenocarcinoma of the \n\npancreas in POLO (BICR, DCO 15 January 2019)\n\nOlaparib 300 mg bd Placebo\n\nPFS (68% maturity)a,b\n\nNumber of events: Total number of patients (%) 60:92 (65) 44:62 (71)\nMedian time, months (95% CI) 7.4 (4.14-11.01) 3.8 (3.52-4.86)\nHR (95% CI)c,d 0.53 (0.35-0.82)\nP value (2-sided) p=0.0038\n\nORR\nNumber of objective responders: total number of \npatients with measurable disease at baseline (%)\n\n18:78 (23.1) 6:52 (11.5)\n\nComplete response (%) 2 (2.6) 0\nPartial response (%) 16 (20.5) 6 (11.5)\n\nDoR\nMedian time (months) (95% CI) 24.9 (14.75-NC) 3.7 (2.10-NC)\n\na Based on Kaplan–Meier estimates, the proportion of patients that were alive and progression-free at 12 and 24 months \nwere 34% and 22% for olaparib vs 15% and 10% for placebo.\n\nb For PFS, the median follow-up time for censored patients was 9.1 months in the olaparib arm and 3.8 months in the \nplacebo arm.

Consequently, Lynparza may be taken without regard to food (see section 4.2).\n\nDistribution\nThe in vitro plasma protein binding is approximately 82% at 10 µg/mL which is approximately Cmax.\n\nIn vitro, human plasma protein binding of olaparib was dose-dependent; the fraction bound was \napproximately 91% at 1 µg/mL, reducing to 82% at 10 µg/mL and to 70% at 40 µg/mL. In solutions of \npurified proteins, the olaparib fraction bound to albumin was approximately 56%, which was \nindependent of olaparib concentrations. Using the same assay, the fraction bound to alpha-1 acid \nglycoprotein was 29% at 10 µg/mL with a trend of decreased binding at higher concentrations.\n\nBiotransformation\nIn vitro, CYP3A4/5 were shown to be the enzymes primarily responsible for the metabolism of \nolaparib (see section 4.5).\n\nFollowing oral dosing of 14C-olaparib to female patients, unchanged olaparib accounted for the \nmajority of the circulating radioactivity in plasma (70%) and was the major component found in both \nurine and faeces (15% and 6% of the dose, respectively). The metabolism of olaparib is extensive. The \nmajority of the metabolism was attributable to oxidation reactions with a number of the components \nproduced undergoing subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Up to 20, 37 and 20 metabolites \nwere detected in plasma, urine and faeces, respectively, the majority of them representing < 1% of the \ndosed material. A ring-opened piperazin-3-ol moiety, and two mono-oxygenated metabolites (each \n~10%) were the major circulating components, with one of the mono-oxygenated metabolites also \nbeing the major metabolite in the excreta (6% and 5% of the urinary and faecal radioactivity,\nrespectively). \n\nIn vitro, olaparib produced little/no inhibition of UGT1A4, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or CYPs 1A2, 2A6, \n2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 2E1 and is not expected to be a clinically significant time dependent \ninhibitor of any of these CYP enzymes. Olaparib inhibited UGT1A1 in vitro, however, PBPK \nsimulations suggest this is not of clinical importance. In vitro, olaparib is a substrate of the efflux \ntransporter P-gp, however, this is unlikely to be of clinical significance (see section 4.5).\n\nIn vitro, data also show that olaparib is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, BCRP or \nMRP2 and is not an inhibitor of OATP1B3, OAT1 or MRP2.\n\n\n\n47\n\nElimination\nFollowing a single dose of 14C-olaparib, ~86% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7-day \ncollection period, ~44% via the urine and ~42% via the faeces. Majority of the material was excreted \nas metabolites. \n\nSpecial populations\nIn population based PK analyses, patient age, gender, bodyweight or race (including White and \nJapanese patients) were not significant covariates.\n\nRenal impairment\nIn patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min), AUC increased by 24% \nand Cmax by 15% compared with patients with normal renal function. No Lynparza dose adjustment is \nrequired for patients with mild renal impairment.\n\nIn patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min), AUC increased by \n44% and Cmax by 26% compared with patients with normal renal function. Lynparza dose adjustment \nis recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2).\n\nThere are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (creatinine \nclearance <30 ml/min).\n\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A), AUC increased by 15% and \nCmax by 13% and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification B), AUC \nincreased by 8% and Cmax decreased by 13% compared with patients with normal hepatic function. No \nLynparza dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsection 4.2). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification \nC).\n\nPaediatric population\nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of olaparib in paediatric patients.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nGenotoxicity\nOlaparib showed no mutagenic potential, but was clastogenic in mammalian cells in vitro. When \ndosed orally to rats, olaparib induced micronuclei in bone marrow. This clastogenicity is consistent \nwith the known pharmacology of olaparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in man.\n\nRepeat-dose toxicity\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 6 months duration in rats and dogs, daily oral doses of olaparib \nwere well-tolerated. The major primary target organ for toxicity in both species was the bone marrow, \nwith associated changes in peripheral haematology parameters. These changes were reversible within \n4 weeks of cessation of dosing. In rats, minimal degenerative effects on gastrointestinal tract were also \nnoted. These findings occurred at exposures below those seen clinically. Studies using human bone \nmarrow cells also showed that direct exposure to olaparib can result in toxicity to bone marrow cells in \nex vivo assays.\n\nReproductive toxicology\nIn a female fertility study where rats were dosed until implantation, although extended oestrus was \nobserved in some animals, mating performance and pregnancy rate was not affected. However, there \nwas a slight reduction in embryofoetal survival.\n\nIn rat embryofoetal development studies, and at dose levels that did not induce significant maternal \ntoxicity, olaparib caused reduced embryofoetal survival, reduced foetal weight and foetal \n\n\n\n48\n\ndevelopmental abnormalities, including major eye malformations (e.g. anophthalmia, \nmicrophthalmia), vertebral/rib malformation and visceral and skeletal abnormalities. \n\nCarcinogenicity\nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with olaparib.\n\n6.

Olaparib is a type of cancer medicine called a PARP \ninhibitor (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase inhibitor). \n\nIn patients with mutations (changes) in certain genes called BRCA (breast cancer gene), who are at risk \nof developing some forms of cancer, PARP inhibitors are able to trigger the death of cancer cells by \nblocking an enzyme that helps repair DNA.\n\nWhat Lynparza is used for\n\nLynparza is used for the treatment of a type of ovarian cancer called “BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer”. \nIt is used after the cancer has responded to previous treatment with standard platinum-based \nchemotherapy. A test is used to determine whether you have BRCA-mutated cancer.\n\n2.
