This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nAtriance 5 mg/ml solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach ml of solution contains 5 mg of nelarabine. \n\n \n\nEach vial contains 250 mg of nelarabine. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\n \n\nEach ml of solution contains 1.725 mg (75 micromols) of sodium. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for infusion. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nNelarabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia \n\n(T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) whose disease has not responded to or has \n\nrelapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens. \n\nDue to the small patient populations in these disease settings, the information to support these \n\nindications is based on limited data. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nNelarabine must only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of \n\ncytotoxic agents. \n\n \nPosology \n\n \n\nComplete blood counts including platelets must be monitored regularly (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \n\nAdults and adolescents (aged 16 years and older) \n\nThe recommended dose of nelarabine for adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older is \n\n1,500 mg/m2 administered intravenously over two hours on days 1, 3 and 5 and repeated every \n\n21 days. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nChildren and adolescents (aged 21 years and younger) \n\nThe recommended dose of nelarabine for children and adolescents (aged 21 years and younger) is \n\n650 mg/m2 administered intravenously over one hour daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every \n\n21 days. \n\n \n\nIn clinical studies, the 650 mg/m2 and 1,500 mg/m2 dose have both been used in patients in the age \n\nrange 16 to 21 years. Efficacy and safety were similar for both regimens. The prescribing physician \n\nshould consider which regimen is appropriate when treating patients in this age range. \n\n \n\nLimited clinical pharmacology data are available for patients below the age of 4 years (see \n\nsection 5.2). \n\n \n\nDose modification \n\nNelarabine must be discontinued at the first sign of neurological events of National Cancer Institute \n\nCommon Terminology Criteria Adverse Event (NCI CTCAE) grade 2 or greater. Delaying subsequent \n\ndosing is an option for other toxicities, including haematological toxicity. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nInsufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years of age and older have been treated with nelarabine to \n\ndetermine whether they respond differently than younger patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNelarabine has not been studied in individuals with renal impairment. Nelarabine and 9-β-D-\n\narabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G) are partially renally excreted (see section 5.2). There are insufficient \n\ndata to support a dose adjustment recommendation for patients with a renal clearance of creatinine Clcr \n\nless than 50 ml/min. Patients with renal impairment must be closely monitored for toxicities when \n\ntreated with nelarabine. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNelarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. These patients should be treated \n\nwith caution. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nNelarabine is for intravenous use only and must not be diluted prior to administration. The appropriate \n\ndose of nelarabine must be transferred into polyvinylchloride (PVC) or ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) \n\ninfusion bags or glass containers and administered intravenously as a two-hour infusion in adult \n\npatients and as a one-hour infusion in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nNEUROLOGICAL ADVERSE REACTIONS \n\nSevere neurological reactions have been reported with the use of nelarabine. These reactions have \n\nincluded altered mental states including severe somnolence, confusion and coma, central nervous \n\nsystem effects including convulsions, ataxia and status epilepticus, and peripheral neuropathy \nincluding hypoesthesia ranging from numbness and paresthesias to motor weakness and paralysis. \n\nThere have also been reports of reactions associated with demyelination, and ascending peripheral \n\nneuropathies similar in appearance to Guillain-Barré Syndrome. (see section 4.8). \nNeurotoxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity of nelarabine. Full recovery from these reactions has not \n\nalways occurred with cessation of nelarabine. Therefore, close monitoring for neurological reactions \n\nis strongly recommended, and nelarabine must be discontinued at the first sign of neurological \n\nreactions of NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nPatients treated previously or concurrently with intrathecal chemotherapy or previously with \n\ncraniospinal irradiation are potentially at increased risk for neurological adverse events (see \n\nsection 4.2 - dose modification) and therefore concomitant intrathecal therapy and/or craniospinal \n\nirradiation is not recommended. \n\n \n\nImmunisation using a live organism vaccine has the potential to cause infection in \n\nimmunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunisations with live organism vaccines are not \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nLeukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia, (including febrile neutropenia) have been \n\nassociated with nelarabine therapy. Complete blood counts including platelets must be monitored \n\nregularly (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nPatients receiving nelarabine are recommended to receive intravenous hydration according to standard \n\nmedical practice for the management of hyperuricaemia in patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome. \n\nFor patients at risk of hyperuricaemia, the use of allopurinol should be considered. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nClinical studies of nelarabine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to \n\ndetermine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In an exploratory analysis, \n\nincreasing age, especially age 65 years and older, appeared to be associated with increased rates of \n\nneurological adverse events. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity and mutagenicity \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity testing of nelarabine has not been performed. Nelarabine however, is known to be \n\ngenotoxic to mammalian cells (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nSodium warning \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 1.725 mg/ml (75 micromols/ml) of sodium. To be taken into \n\nconsideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nNelarabine and ara-G did not significantly inhibit the activities of the major hepatic cytochrome P450 \n\n(CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or \n\nCYP3A4 in vitro. \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of nelarabine in combination with adenosine deaminase inhibitors such as \n\npentostatin is not recommended. Concomitant administration may reduce the efficacy of nelarabine \n\nand/or change the adverse event profile of either active substance. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\n \n\nBoth sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment \n\nwith nelarabine. Men with partners who are pregnant or could become pregnant should use condoms \n\nduring treatment with nelarabine and for at least three months following cessation of treatment. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of nelarabine in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk in humans is \n\nunknown, however, exposure during pregnancy will likely lead to anomalies and malformations of the \n\nfoetus. \n\n \n\nNelarabine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If a patient becomes \n\npregnant during treatment with nelarabine, they should be informed of the possible risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is unknown whether nelarabine or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. A risk to the \n\nnewborn/infant cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \n\nAtriance. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effect of nelarabine on fertility in humans is unknown. Based on the pharmacological action of the \n\ncompound, undesirable effects on fertility are possible. Family planning should be discussed with \n\npatients as appropriate. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nAtriance has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nPatients treated with nelarabine are potentially at risk of suffering from somnolence during and for \n\nseveral days after treatment. Patients must be cautioned that somnolence can affect performance of \n\nskilled tasks, such as driving. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe safety profile from pivotal clinical studies at the recommended doses of nelarabine in adults \n\n(1,500 mg/m2) and children (650 mg/m2) is based on data from 103 adults and 84 paediatric patients \n\nrespectively. The most frequently occurring adverse events were fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders; \n\nhaematological disorders; respiratory disorders; nervous system disorders (somnolence, peripheral \n\nneurological disorders [sensory and motor], dizziness, hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, headache); and \n\npyrexia. Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity associated with nelarabine therapy (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following convention has been utilised for the classification of frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), \n\ncommon (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \n\nrare (< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions Adults (1,500 mg/m2) \n\nN=103 \n\nChildren (650 mg/m2) \n\nN=84 \n\nInfections and infestations \n\nInfection (including but not limited to; sepsis, \n\nbacteraemia, pneumonia, fungal infection) \n\nVery common: 40 (39%) Very common: 13 (15%) \n\n\n\n6 \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)  \n\nTumour lysis syndrome (see also data from \n\ncompassionate use programme and non-\n\npivotal studies) \n\nCommon: 1 (1%) N/A \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nFebrile neutropenia Very common: 12 (12%) Common: 1 (1%) \n\nNeutropenia Very common: 83 (81%) Very common: 79 (94%) \n\nLeukopenia Common: 3 (3%) Very common: 32 (38%) \n\nThrombocytopenia Very common: 89 (86%) Very common: 74 (88%) \n\nAnaemia Very common: 102 \n\n(99%) \n\nVery common: 80 (95%) \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHypoglycaemia N/A Common: 5 (6%) \n\nHypocalcaemia Common: 3 (3%) Common: 7 (8%) \n\nHypomagnesaemia Common: 4 (4%) Common: 5 (6%) \n\nHypokalaemia Common: 4 (4%) Very common: 9 (11%) \n\nAnorexia Common: 9 (9%) N/A \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nConfusional state Common: 8 (8%) Common: 2 (2%) \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nSeizures (including convulsions, grand mal \n\nconvulsions, status epilepticus) \n\nCommon: 1 (1%) Common: 5 (6%) \n\nAmnesia Common: 3 (3%) N/A \n\nSomnolence Very common: 24 (23%) Common: 6 (7%) \n\nPeripheral neurological disorders (sensory and \n\nmotor) \n\nVery common: 22 (21%) Very common: 10 (12%) \n\nHypoesthesia Very common: 18 (17%) Common: 5 (6%) \n\nParaesthesia Very common: 15 (15%) Common: 3 (4%) \n\nAtaxia Common: 9 (9%) Common: 2 (2%) \n\nBalance disorder Common: 2 (2%) N/A \n\nTremor Common: 5 (5%) Common: 3 (4%) \n\nDizziness Very common: 22 (21%) N/A \n\nHeadache Very common: 15 (15%) Very common: 14 (17%) \n\nDysgeusia Common: 3 (3%) N/A \n\nEye disorders \n\nBlurred vision Common: 4(4%) N/A \n\nVascular disorders \n\nHypotension Common: 8 (8%) N/A \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nPleural effusion Common: 10 (10%) N/A \n\nWheezing Common: 5 (5%) N/A \n\nDyspnoea Very common: 21 (20%) N/A \n\nCough Very common: 26 (25%) N/A \n\n\n\n7 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nDiarrhoea Very common: 23 (22%) Common: 2 (2%) \n\nStomatitis Common: 8 (8%) Common: 1 (1%) \n\nVomiting Very common: 23 (22%) Common: 8 (10%) \n\nAbdominal pain Common: 9 (9%) N/A \n\nConstipation Very common: 22 (21%) Common: 1 (1%) \n\nNausea Very common: 42 (41%) Common: 2 (2%) \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia Common: 3 (3%) Common: 8 (10%) \n\nTransaminases increased N/A Very common: 10(12%) \n\nAspartate aminotransferase increased Common: 6 (6%) N/A \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n\nMuscle weakness Common: 8 (8%) N/A \n\nMyalgia Very common: 13 (13%) N/A \n\nArthralgia Common: 9 (9%) Common: 1 (1%) \n\nBack pain Common: 8 (8%) N/A \n\nPain in extremity Common: 7 (7%) Common: 2 (2%) \n\nRhabdomyolysis, blood creatine \n\nphosphokinase increased (see “Post – \n\nmarketing data”) \n\nRare: N/A Rare: N/A \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n\nBlood creatinine increased Common: 2 (2%) Common: 5 (6%) \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nOedema Very common: 11 (11%) N/A \n\nGait abnormal Common: 6 (6%) N/A \n\nOedema peripheral Very common: 15 (15%) N/A \n\nPyrexia Very common: 24 (23%) Common: 2 (2%) \n\nPain Very common: 11 (11%) N/A \n\nFatigue Very common: 51 (50%) Common: 1 (1%) \n\nAsthenia Very common: 18 (17%) Common: 5 (6%) \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nInfection and infestations \n\nThere was a single additional report of biopsy confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n\nin the adult population. \n\nThere have been reports of sometimes fatal opportunistic infections in patients receiving nelarabine \n\ntherapy. \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nThere have been reports of events associated with demyelination and ascending peripheral \n\nneuropathies similar in appearance to Guillain-Barré syndrome. \n\nTwo paediatric patients had fatal neurological events. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nData from NCI studies/compassionate use programme and phase I studies \n\n \n\nIn addition to the adverse reactions seen in the pivotal clinical studies, there are also data from \n\n875 patients from NCI studies/compassionate use programme (694 patients) and Phase I (181 patients) \n\nstudies of nelarabine. The following additional adverse reactions were seen: \n\n \n\nNeoplasms benign and malignant (including cysts and polyps) \n\nTumour lysis syndrome – 7 cases (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) \n\n \n\nPost–marketing data \n\n \n\nRhabdomyolysis and increased blood creatine phosphokinase have been identified during post-\n\napproval use of nelarabine. This includes spontaneous case reports as well as serious adverse events \n\nfrom ongoing studies. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n\n \n\nNelarabine has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 75 mg/kg (approximately \n\n2,250 mg/m2) daily for 5 days to a paediatric patient, up to a dose of 60 mg/kg (approximately \n\n2,400 mg/m2) daily for 5 days to 5 adult patients and up to 2,900 mg/m2 in a further 2 adults on days 1, \n\n3 and 5. \n\n \n\nSymptoms and signs \n\n \n\nIt is likely that nelarabine overdose would result in severe neurotoxicity (possibly including paralysis, \n\ncoma), myelosuppression and potentially death. At a dose of 2200 mg/m2 given on days 1, 3 and \n\n5 every 21 days, 2 patients developed a significant grade 3 ascending sensory neuropathy. MRI \n\nevaluations of the 2 patients demonstrated findings consistent with a demyelinating process in the \n\ncervical spine. \n\n \n\nTreatment \n\n \n\nThere is no known antidote for nelarabine overdose. Supportive care consistent with good clinical \n\npractice should be provided. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, purine analogues, ATC code: \n\nL01B B 07 \n\n \n\nNelarabine is a pro-drug of the deoxyguanosine analogue ara-G. Nelarabine is rapidly demethylated by \n\nadenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxyguanosine \n\nkinase and deoxycytidine kinase to its 5’-monophosphate metabolite. The monophosphate metabolite \n\nis subsequently converted to the active 5’-triphosphate form, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in \n\nleukaemic blasts allows for preferential incorporation of ara-GTP into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \n\nleading to inhibition of DNA synthesis. This results in cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to \n\nthe cytotoxic effects of nelarabine. In vitro, T-cells are more sensitive than B-cells to the cytotoxic \n\neffects of nelarabine. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and data \n\n \n\nAdult clinical study in relapsed or refractory T-ALL and T-LBL \n\nIn an open-label study carried out by the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B and the Southwest Oncology \n\nGroup, the safety and efficacy of nelarabine were evaluated in 39 adults with T-cell acute \n\nlymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Twenty–eight of the \n\n39 adults had relapsed or were refractory to at least two prior induction regimens and aged between 16 \n\nto 65 years of age (mean 34 years). Nelarabine at a dose of 1500 mg/m2/day was administered \n\nintravenously over two hours on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21 day cycle. Five of the 28 patients (18 %) \n\n[95 % CI: 6 %—37 %] treated with nelarabine achieved a complete response (bone marrow blast \n\ncounts ≤ 5 %, no other evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts). A total of \n\n6 patients (21 %) [95 % CI: 8 %–41 %] achieved a complete response with or without haematological \n\nrecovery. Time to complete response in both classifications of response ranged from 2.9 to \n\n11.7 weeks. Duration of response (in both classifications of response (n=5) ranged between 15 and \n\n195+ weeks. Median overall survival was 20.6 weeks [95 % CI: 10.4–36.4]. Survival at one year was \n\n29 % [95 % CI: 12 %–45 %]. \n\n \n\nPaediatric clinical study in relapsed or refractory T-ALL and T-LBL \n\nIn an open-label, multicenter study carried out by Childrens Oncology Group, nelarabine was \n\nadministered intravenously over 1 hour for 5 days to 151 patients ≤ 21 years of age, 149 of whom had \n\nrelapsed or refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic \n\nlymphoma (T-LBL). Eighty-four (84) patients, 39 of whom had received two or more prior induction \n\nregimens and 31 whom had received one prior induction regimen, were treated with 650 mg/m2/day of \n\nnelarabine administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every \n\n21 days. \n\n \n\nOf the 39 patients who had received two or more prior induction regimens, 5 (13 %) [95 % CI: 4 %–\n\n27 %] achieved a complete response (bone marrow blast counts ≤ 5 %, no other evidence of disease, \n\nand full recovery of peripheral blood counts) and 9 (23 %) [95 % CI: 11 %–39 %] achieved complete \n\nresponses with or without full haematological recovery. Duration of response in both classifications of \n\nresponse ranged between 4.7 and 36.4 weeks and median overall survival was 13.1 weeks [95 % CI: \n\n8.7–17.4] and survival at one year was 14 % [95 % CI: 3 %–26 %]. \n\n \n\nThirteen (42 %) of the 31 patients treated with one prior induction regimen achieved a complete \n\nresponse overall. Nine of these 31 patients failed to respond to prior induction (refractory patients). \n\nFour (44 %) of the nine refractory patients experienced a complete response to nelarabine. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has been authorised under “exceptional circumstances”. This means that due to \n\nthe rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal \n\nproduct. \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \n\nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nNelarabine is a pro-drug of the deoxyguanosine analogue ara-G. Nelarabine is rapidly demethylated by \n\nadenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxyguanosine \n\nkinase and deoxycytidine kinase to its 5’-monophosphate metabolite. The monophosphate metabolite \n\nis subsequently converted to the active 5’-triphosphate from, ara-GTP. Accumulation of ara-GTP in \n\nleukaemic blasts allows for preferential incorporation of ara-GTP into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) \n\nleading to inhibition of DNA synthesis. This results in cell death. Other mechanisms may contribute to \n\nthe cytotoxic effects of nelarabine. In vitro, T-cells are more sensitive than B-cells to the cytotoxic \n\neffects of nelarabine. \n\n \n\nIn a cross-study analysis using data from four Phase I studies, the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and \n\nara-G were characterized in patients aged less than 18 years and adult patients with refractory \n\nleukaemia or lymphoma. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nAdults \n\nPlasma ara-G Cmax values generally occurred at the end of the nelarabine infusion and were generally \n\nhigher than nelarabine Cmax values, suggesting rapid and extensive conversion of nelarabine to ara-G. \n\nAfter infusion of 1,500 mg/m2 nelarabine over two hours in adult patients, mean (%CV) plasma \n\nnelarabine Cmax and AUCinf values were 13.9 µM (81 %) and 13.5 µM.h (56 %) respectively. Mean \n\nplasma ara-G Cmax and AUCinf values were 115 µM (16 %) and 571 µM.h (30 %), respectively. \n\n \n\nIntracellular Cmax for ara-GTP appeared within 3 to 25 hours on day 1. Mean (%CV) intracellular ara-\n\nGTP Cmax and AUC values were 95.6 µM (139 %) and 2214 µM.h (263 %) at this dose. \n\n \n\nPaediatric patients \n\nAfter infusion of 400 or 650 mg/m2 nelarabine over one hour in 6 paediatric patients, mean (%CV) \n\nplasma nelarabine Cmax and AUCinf values, adjusted to a 650 mg/m2 dose, were 45.0 µM (40 %) and \n\n38.0 µM.h (39 %), respectively. Mean plasma ara-G Cmax and AUCinf values were 60.1 µM (17 %) and \n\n212 µM.h (18 %), respectively. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nNelarabine and ara-G are extensively distributed throughout the body based on combined Phase I \n\npharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m2. Specifically, for nelarabine, mean \n\n(%CV) VSS values were 115 l/m2 (159 %) and 89.4 l/m2 (278 %) in adult and paediatric patients, \n\nrespectively. For ara-G, mean VSS/F values were 44.8 l/m2 (32 %) and 32.1 l/m2 (25 %) in adult and \n\npaediatric patients, respectively. \n\n \n\nNelarabine and ara-G are not substantially bound to human plasma proteins (less than 25 %) in vitro, \n\nand binding is independent of nelarabine or ara-G concentrations up to 600 µM. \n\n \n\nNo accumulation of nelarabine or ara-G was observed in plasma after nelarabine administration on \n\neither a daily or a day 1, 3, 5 schedule. \n\n \n\nIntracellular ara-GTP concentrations in leukaemic blasts were quantifiable for a prolonged period after \n\nnelarabine administration. Intracellular ara-GTP accumulated with repeated administration of \n\nnelarabine. On the day 1, 3, and 5 schedule, Cmax and AUC(0-t) values on day 3 were approximately \n\n50 % and 30 %, respectively, greater than Cmax and AUC(0-t) values on day 1. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nThe principal route of metabolism for nelarabine is O-demethylation by adenosine deaminase to form \n\nara-G, which undergoes hydrolysis to form guanine. In addition, some nelarabine is hydrolysed to \n\nform methylguanine, which is O-demethylated to form guanine. Guanine is N-deaminated to form \n\nxanthine, which is further oxidized to yield uric acid. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nNelarabine and ara-G are rapidly eliminated from plasma with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes \n\nand 3 hours, respectively. These findings were demonstrated in patients with refractory leukaemia or \n\nlymphoma given a dose of 1,500 mg/m2 nelarabine (adults) or a 650 mg/m2 (paediatrics). \n\n \n\nCombined Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m2 indicate that mean \n\n(%CV) clearance (Cl) values for nelarabine are 138 l/h/m2 (104 %) and 125 l/h/m2 (214 %) in adult \n\nand paediatric patients, respectively, on day 1 (n = 65 adults, n = 21 paediatric patients). The apparent \n\nclearance of ara-G (Cl/F) is comparable between the two groups [9.5 l/h/m2 (35 %) in adult patients \n\nand 10.8 l/h/m2 (36 %) in paediatric patients] on day 1. \n\n \n\nNelarabine and ara-G are partially eliminated by the kidneys. In 28 adult patients, 24 hours after \n\nnelarabine infusion on day 1, mean urinary excretion of nelarabine and ara-G was 5.3 % and 23.2 % of \n\nthe administered dose, respectively. Renal clearance averaged 9.0 l/h/m2 (151 %) for nelarabine and \n\n2.6 l/h/m2 (83 %) for ara-G in 21 adult patients. \n\n \n\nBecause the timecourse of intracellular ara-GTP was prolonged, its elimination half-life could not be \n\naccurately estimated. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nLimited clinical pharmacology data are available for patients below the age of 4 years. \n\n \n\nCombined Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data at nelarabine doses of 104 to 2,900 mg/m2 indicate that the \n\nclearance (Cl) and Vss values for nelarabine and ara-G are comparable between the two groups. \n\nFurther data with respect to nelarabine and ara-G pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population are \n\nprovided in other subsections. \n\n \n\nGender \n\n \n\nGender has no effect on nelarabine or ara-G plasma pharmacokinetics. Intracellular ara-GTP Cmax and \n\nAUC(0–t) values at the same dose level were 2– to 3– fold greater on average in adult female than in \n\nadult male patients. \n\n \n\nRace \n\n \n\nThe effect of race on nelarabine and ara-G pharmacokinetics has not been specifically studied. In a \n\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic cross study analysis, race had no apparent effect on nelarabine, \n\nara-G, or intracellular ara-GTP pharmacokinetics. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nRenal impairment \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of nelarabine and ara-G have not been specifically studied in renally impaired \n\nor haemodialysed patients. Nelarabine is excreted by the kidney to a small extent (5 to 10 % of the \n\nadministered dose). Ara-G is excreted by the kidney to a greater extent (20 to 30 % of the \n\nadministered nelarabine dose). Adults and children in clinical studies were categorized into the three \n\ngroups according to renal impairment: normal with Clcr greater than 80 ml/min (n = 56), mild with Clcr \n\nequalling 50 to 80 ml/min (n = 12), and moderate with Clcr less than 50 ml/min (n = 2). The mean \n\napparent clearance (Cl/F) of ara-G was about 7 % lower in patients with mild renal impairment than in \n\npatients with normal renal function (see section 4.2). No data are available to provide a dose advice for \n\npatients with Clcr less than 50 ml/min. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nAge has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine or ara-G. Decreased renal function, which is \n\nmore common in the elderly, may reduce ara-G clearance (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nAdverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to \n\nclinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: nelarabine caused \n\nhistopathological changes to the central nervous system (white matter vacuolation and degenerative \n\nchanges in cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord) of monkeys after daily treatment with nelarabine for \n\n23 days, at exposures below the human therapeutic exposure. Nelarabine showed in vitro cytotoxicity \n\nto monocytes and macrophages. \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity \n\n \n\nCarcinogenicity testing of nelarabine has not been performed. \n\n \n\nMutagenicity \n\n \n\nNelarabine was mutagenic to L5178Y/TK mouse lymphoma cells with and without metabolic \n\nactivation. \n\n \n\nReproduction toxicity \n\n \n\nCompared to controls, nelarabine caused increased incidences of foetal malformations, anomalies, and \n\nvariations in rabbits when given at doses approximately 24 % of the adult human dose on a mg/m2 \n\nbasis during the period of organogenesis. Cleft palate was seen in rabbits given a dose approximately \n\n2-fold the adult human dose, absent pollices in rabbits given a dose approximately 79 % of the adult \n\nhuman dose while absent gall bladder, accessory lung lobes, fused or extra sternebrae and delayed \n\nossification was seen at all doses. Maternal body weight gain and foetal body weights were reduced in \n\nrabbits given a dose approximately 2-fold the adult human dose. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted in animals to assess the effects of nelarabine on fertility. However, no \n\nundesirable effects were seen in the testes or ovaries of monkeys given nelarabine intravenously at \n\ndoses up to approximately 32 % of the adult human dose on a mg/m2 basis for 30 consecutive days. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Atriance is and what it is used for \n \n\nAtriance contains nelarabine which belongs to a group of medicines known as antineoplastic agents, \n\nused in chemotherapy to kill some types of cancer cells. \n\n \n\nAtriance is used to treat patients with: \n a type of leukaemia, called T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Leukaemia causes an \n\nabnormal increase in the number of white blood cells. The abnormal high number of white \n\nblood cells can appear in the blood and other parts of the body. The type of leukaemia relates to \n\nthe type of white blood cell mainly involved. In this case, its cells are called lymphoblasts. \n\n a type of lymphoma, called T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. This lymphoma is caused by a \n\nmass of lymphoblasts, a type of white blood cell. \n\n \n\nIf you have any questions about your illness, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you are given Atriance \n \n\nYou (or your child, if he/she is being treated) must not receive Atriance \n if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) are allergic to nelarabine or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \nSevere nervous system side effects have been reported with the use of Atriance. Symptoms may be \n\nmental (e.g. tiredness) or physical (e.g. convulsions, feelings of numbness or tingling, weakness and \nparalysis). Your doctor will check for these symptoms regularly during treatment (see also \n\nsection 4, \"Possible side effects\"). \n  \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nYour doctor also needs to know the following before you are given this medicine: \n\n if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) have any kidney or liver problems. Your \n\ndose of Atriance may need to be adjusted. \n\n if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) have recently been, or plan to be vaccinated \nwith a live vaccine (for example polio, varicella, typhoid). \n\n if you (or your child, if he/she is being treated) have any blood problems (for example \n\nanaemia). \n\n \n\nBlood tests during treatment \n\nYour doctor should perform blood tests regularly during treatment to check for blood problems that \n\nhave been associated with the use of Atriance. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nIf you are an elderly person, you could be more sensitive to nervous system side effects (see the list \n\nabove under “Warnings and precautions”). Your doctor will check for these symptoms regularly \n\nduring treatment. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if any of these apply to you. \n \n\nOther medicines and Atriance \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. This includes any herbal products or medicines you have bought without a prescription \n\n \n\nRemember to tell your doctor if you start to take any other medicines while you are on Atriance. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nAtriance is not recommended for pregnant women. It may harm a baby if conceived before, during or \n\nsoon after treatment. Consideration to appropriate birth control is recommended to be discussed with \n\nyour doctor. Do not try and become pregnant/father a child until your doctor advises you it is safe to \n\ndo so. \n\n \n\nMale patients, who may wish to father a child, should ask their doctor for family planning advice or \n\ntreatment. If pregnancy occurs during treatment with Atriance, you must tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether Atriance is passed on through breast milk. Breast-feeding must be \n\ndiscontinued while you are taking Atriance. Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nAtriance can make people feel drowsy or sleepy, both during and for some days after treatment. If you \n\nfeel tired or weak, do not drive, and do not use any tools or machines. \n\n \n\nAtriance contains sodium \nThis medicine contains at least 23 mg sodium per dose. This is to be taken into consideration if you \n\nare on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n3. How Atriance is given \n \n\nThe dose of Atriance you are given will be based on: \n\n your/your child's (if he/she is being treated) body surface area (which will be calculated by \nyour doctor based on your height and weight). \n\n the results of blood tests carried out before treatment \n \n\nAdults and adolescents (aged 16 years and older) \nThe usual dose is 1,500 mg/m2 of body surface area per day. \n\n \n\nA doctor or nurse will give you the dose of Atriance as an infusion (a drip). It is usually dripped into \n\nyour arm over a period of about 2 hours. \n\n \n\nYou will have an infusion (a drip) once a day on days 1, 3 and 5 of treatment. This pattern of \n\ntreatment will normally be repeated every three weeks. This treatment may vary, depending on the \n\nresults of your regular blood tests. Your doctor will decide how many treatment cycles are required. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents (aged 21 years and younger) \nThe recommended dose is 650 mg/m2 of body surface area per day. \n\n \n\nA doctor or nurse will give you/your child (if he/she is being treated) a suitable dose of Atriance as \n\nan infusion (a drip). It is usually dripped into your arm over a period of about 1 hour. \n\n \n\nYou/your child (if he/she is being treated) will have an infusion (a drip) once a day for 5 days. \n\nThis pattern of treatment will normally be repeated every three weeks. This treatment may vary, \n\ndepending on the results of regular blood tests. Your doctor will decide how many treatment cycles are \n\nrequired. \n\n \n\nStopping treatment with Atriance \nYour doctor will decide when to stop the treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe majority of side effects reported with Atriance were seen in adults, children and adolescents. \n\nSome of the side effects were reported more often in adult patients. There is no known reason for this. \n\n \n\nIf you have any concerns, discuss them with your doctor. \n\n \n\nMost serious side effects \n \n\nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance. \n\n Signs of infection. Atriance may reduce the number of white blood cells and lower your \n\nresistance to infection (including pneumonia). This can even be life threatening. Signs of an \n\ninfection include: \n\n- fever \n- serious deterioration of your general condition \n- local symptoms such as sore throat, sore mouth or urinary problems (for example, a \n\nburning sensation when urinating, which may be a urinary infection) \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you get any of these. A blood test will be taken to check possible \n\nreduction of white blood cells. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nOther very common side effects \nThese may affect more than 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance \n\n Changes in the sense of feeling in hands or feet, muscle weakness appearing as difficulty getting \n\nup from a chair, or difficulty walking (peripheral neuropathy); reduced sensitivity to light \n\ntouch, or pain; abnormal sensations such as burning and, prickling, a sensation of something \n\ncrawling on the skin. \n\n Feeling generally weak and tired (temporary anaemia). In some cases you may need a blood \n\ntransfusion. \n\n Unusual bruising or bleeding, caused by a decrease in the number of clotting cells in the blood. \n\nThis can lead to severe bleeding from relatively small injuries such as a small cut. Rarely, it can \n\nlead to even more severe bleeding (haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor for advice on how to \n\nminimize the risk of bleeding. \n\n Feeling drowsy and sleepy; headache; dizziness. \n\n Shortness of breath, difficult or laboured breathing; cough. \n\n Feeling of an upset stomach (nausea); being sick/throwing up (vomiting); diarrhoea; \n\nconstipation \n\n Muscle pain. \n\n Swelling of parts of the body due to accumulation of abnormal amounts of fluid (oedema). \n\n High body temperature (fever); tiredness; feeling weak/loss of strength. \n\nTell a doctor if any of these becomes troublesome. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects \n \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 10 people treated with Atriance: \n\n Violent, uncontrollable muscular contractions often accompanied by unconsciousness that can \n\nbe due to an epileptic attack (seizures). \n\n Clumsiness and lack of coordination affecting balance, walking, limb or eye movements, or \n\nspeech. \n\n Unintentional rhythmic shaking of one or more limbs (tremors). \n\n Muscle weakness (possibly associated with peripheral neuropathy – see above), joint pain, back \n\npain; pains in hands and feet including a sensation of pins and needles sensation and numbness. \n\n Lowered blood pressure. \n\n Weight loss and loss of appetite (anorexia); stomach pains; sore mouth, mouth ulcers or \n\ninflammation. \n\n Problems with memory, feeling disoriented; blurred vision; altered or loss of sense of taste \n\n(dysgeusia). \n\n Build up of fluid around the lungs leading to chest pain and difficulty in breathing (pleural \n\neffusion); wheezing \n\n Increased amounts of bilirubin in your blood, which may cause yellowing of the skin and may \n\nmake you feel lethargic. \n\n Increases in blood levels of liver enzymes. \n\n Increases in blood creatinine levels (a sign of kidney problems, which might lead less frequent \n\nurination). \n\n The release of tumour cell contents (tumour lysis syndrome), which may put extra stress on your \n\nbody. Initial symptoms including nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, an irregular \n\nheartbeat, clouding of urine, lethargy and/or joint discomfort. If this does occur, it is most likely \n\nto occur at the first dose. Your doctor will take appropriate precautions to minimise the risk of \n\nthis. \n\n Low blood levels of some substances: \n\n- low calcium levels, which may cause muscle cramps, abdominal cramps or spasms \n- low magnesium levels, which may cause muscle weakness, confusion, \"jerky\" \n\nmovements, high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms and decreased reflexes with \n\nseverely low blood magnesium levels. \n\n- low potassium levels may cause a feeling of weakness \n- low glucose levels, which may cause nausea, sweating, weakness, faintness, confusion or \n\nhallucinations. \n\nTell a doctor if any of these becomes troublesome. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nRare side effects \n\n \n\nThese may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people treated with Atriance \n\n Serious disease that destroys skeletal muscle characterized by the presence of myoglobin (a \nbreakdown product of muscle cells) in the urine (Rhabdomyolysis), increase in blood creatine \n\nphosphokinase. \n\nTell a doctor if any of these becomes troublesome. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.
