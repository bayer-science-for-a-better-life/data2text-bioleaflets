PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection/infusion (injection/infusion).\n\nClear, colourless solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFilgrastim is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile \nneutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the \nexception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the \nduration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow \ntransplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic \nchemotherapy.\n\nFilgrastim is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs).\n\nIn patients, children or adults, with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an \nabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) of \u2264 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long \nterm administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence \nand duration of infection-related events.\n\nFilgrastim is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to \n1.0 x 109/L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections \nwhen other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nFilgrastim therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience \nin G-CSF treatment and haematology and has the necessary diagnostic facilities. The mobilisation and \napheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an oncology-haematology centre with \nacceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be \ncorrectly performed.\n\nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU (5 \u00b5g)/kg/day. The first dose of filgrastim should be \nadministered at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. In randomised clinical trials, a \nsubcutaneous dose of 230 \u00b5g/m2/day (4.0 to 8.4 \u00b5g/kg/day) was used.\n\nDaily dosing with filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the \nneutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy for solid \ntumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemia, it is expected that the duration of treatment required to \nfulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute \nmyeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on \nthe type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used. \n\nIn patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen \n1 to 2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, \nfilgrastim therapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil \ncount has recovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of filgrastim therapy, prior to the \ntime of the expected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nFilgrastim may be given as a daily subcutaneous injection or as a daily intravenous infusion diluted in \n5% glucose solution given over 30 minutes (see section 6.6). The subcutaneous route is preferred in \nmost cases. There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing \nmay shorten the duration of effect. The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose \nadministration is not clear. The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.\n\n\n\n4\n\nIn patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MU (10 \u00b5g)/kg/day. The first dose of filgrastim \nshould be administered at least 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after\nbone marrow infusion. \n\nOnce the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of filgrastim should be titrated against the \nneutrophil response as follows: \n\nNeutrophil count Filgrastim dose adjustment\n> 1.0 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 0.5 MU (5 \u00b5g)/kg/day\nThen, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 109/L for 3 more \nconsecutive days\n\nDiscontinue filgrastim \n\nIf the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 109/L during the treatment period the dose of filgrastim should be \nre-escalated according to the above steps.\n\nANC = absolute neutrophil count\n\nMethod of administration\n\nFilgrastim may be given as a 30 minute or 24 hour intravenous infusion or given by continuous \n24 hour subcutaneous infusion. Filgrastim should be diluted in 20 ml of 5% glucose solution (see \nsection 6.6). \n\nFor the mobilisation of PBPCs in patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy \nfollowed by autologous PBPC transplantation\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU\n(10 \u00b5g)/kg/day for 5 to 7 consecutive days. Timing of leukapheresis: one or two leukapheresis on \ndays 5 and 6 are often sufficient. In other circumstances, additional leukapheresis may be necessary. \nFilgrastim dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis. \n\nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is \n0.5 MU (5 \u00b5g)/kg/day from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the expected \nneutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Leukapheresis \nshould be performed during the period when the ANC rises from < 0.5 x 109/L to > 5.0 x 109/L. For \npatients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one leukapheresis is often sufficient. In other \ncircumstances, additional leukapheresis is recommended. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone:\n\nFilgrastim may be given as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion or subcutaneous injection. For \ninfusions filgrastim should be diluted in 20 ml of 5% glucose solution (see section 6.6).\n\nFilgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy:\n\nFilgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.\n\n\n\n5\n\nFor the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation\n\nPosology\n\nFor PBPC mobilisation in normal donors, filgrastim should be administered at 1.0 MU (10 \u00b5g)/kg/day \nfor 4 to 5 consecutive days. Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and continued until day 6 if \nneeded in order to collect 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient bodyweight. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nFilgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.\n\nIn patients with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)\n\nPosology\n\nCongenital neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU (12 \u00b5g)/kg/day as a single dose or \nin divided doses. \n\nIdiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: the recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU (5 \u00b5g)/kg/day as a single \ndose or in divided doses. \n\nDose adjustment: Filgrastim should be administered daily by subcutaneous injection until the \nneutrophil count has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 109/L. When the response has \nbeen obtained the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long term daily \nadministration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of therapy, \nthe initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response. Subsequently the \ndose may be individually adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count \nbetween 1.5 x 109/L and 10 x 109/L. A faster schedule of dose escalation may be considered in patients \npresenting with severe infections. In clinical trials, 97% of patients who responded had a complete \nresponse at doses \u2264 24 \u00b5g/kg/day. The long-term safety of filgrastim administration above \n24 \u00b5g/kg/day in patients with SCN has not been established. \n\nMethod of administration\n\nCongenital, idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: Filgrastim should be given by subcutaneous injection.\n\nIn patients with HIV infection\n\nPosology\n\nFor reversal of neutropenia:\n\nThe recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU (1 \u00b5g)/kg/day with titration up to a maximum \nof 0.4 MU (4 \u00b5g)/kg/day until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC \n> 2.0 x 109/L). In clinical studies, > 90% of patients responded at these doses, achieving reversal of \nneutropenia in a median of 2 days. \n\nIn a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU (10 \u00b5g)/kg/day were required to achieve \nreversal of neutropenia. \n\nFor maintaining normal neutrophil counts:\n\nWhen reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal \nneutrophil count should be established. Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU \n(300 \u00b5g)/day is recommended. Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by the \npatient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 109/L. In clinical studies, dosing with \n\n\n\n6\n\n30 MU (300 \u00b5g)/day on 1 to 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/L, with \nthe median dose frequency being 3 days per week. Long term administration may be required to \nmaintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/L.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nReversal of neutropenia or maintaining normal neutrophil counts: filgrastim should be given by \nsubcutaneous injection.\n\nElderly\n\nClinical trials with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies have \nnot been performed in this group and therefore specific dosage recommendations cannot be made. \n\nRenal or hepatic impairment\n\nStudies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it \nexhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. \nDose adjustment is not required in these circumstances. \n\nPaediatric use in the SCN and cancer settings\n\nSixty-five percent of the patients studied in the SCN trial program were under 18 years of age. The \nefficacy of treatment was clear for this age group, which included most patients with congenital \nneutropenia. There were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN. \n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\nThe dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving \nmyelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy. \n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nSpecial warning and precautions across indications\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \nbeen reported in patients treated with filgrastim. Permanently discontinue filgrastim in patients with \nclinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer filgrastim to patients with a history of \nhypersensitivity to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. \n\nPulmonary adverse effects\n\nPulmonary adverse effects, in particular interstitial lung disease, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of lung infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk. \nThe onset of pulmonary signs, such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological \n\n\n\n7\n\nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of \nacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate \ntreatment given.\n\nGlomerulonephritis\n\nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended.\n\nCapillary leak syndrome\n\nCapillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported after \ngranulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, and is characterised by hypotension, \nhypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary \nleak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may \ninclude a need for intensive care (see section 4.8).\n\nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture\n\nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture have been reported in \npatients and normal donors following administration of filgrastim. Some cases of splenic rupture were \nfatal. Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A \ndiagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/or patients reporting left upper \nabdominal or shoulder tip pain. Dose reductions of filgrastim have been noted to slow or stop the \nprogression of splenic enlargement in patients with severe chronic neutropenia, and in 3% of patients a \nsplenectomy was required.\n\nMalignant cell growth\n\nGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n\nMyelodysplastic syndrome or Chronic myeloid leukaemia\n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, or \nchronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established. Filgrastim is not indicated for use in these \nconditions. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of \nchronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia. \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia\n\nIn view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be \nadministered with caution. The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML \npatients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics (t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16)) have not been \nestablished. \n\nThrombocytopenia\n\nThrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim. Platelet counts should be \nmonitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy. Consideration should be \ngiven to temporary discontinuation or dose reduction of filgrastim in patients with severe chronic \nneutropenia who develop thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 109/L).\n\n\n\n8\n\nLeucocytosis\n\nWhite blood cell counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 5% of cancer \npatients receiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MU/kg/day (3 \u00b5g/kg/day). No undesirable effects\ndirectly attributable to this degree of leucocytosis have been reported. However, in view of the \npotential risks associated with severe leucocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at \nregular intervals during filgrastim therapy. If leucocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/L after the expected \nnadir, filgrastim should be discontinued immediately. When administered for PBPC mobilisation, \nfilgrastim should be discontinued or its dosage should be reduced if the leucocyte counts rise to \n> 70 x 109/L. \n\nImmunogenicity\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rate of generation of \nantibodies against filgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all \nbiologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present.\n\nAortitis\n\nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases, aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF (see section 4.8). \n\nSpecial warning and precautions associated with co-morbidities\n\nSpecial precautions in sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease\n\nSickle cell crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in patients with \nsickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Physicians should use caution when prescribing filgrastim in \npatients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease.\n\nOsteoporosis\n\nMonitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases \nwho undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months.\n\nSpecial precautions in cancer patients\n\nFilgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established \ndosage regimens.\n\nRisks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy\n\nSpecial caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy, because improved \ntumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may lead \nto increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, and dermatologic effects (please refer \nto the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy agents used). \n\nEffect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes\n\nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy \n(e.g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should \nbe taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause \nsevere thrombocytopenia. \n\n\n\n9\n\nThe use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of \nthrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy. \n\nOther special precautions \n\nThe effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been \nstudied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil \ncounts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors neutrophil response may be diminished (such as \nthose treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration by \ntumour). \n\nVascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been \nreported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation.\n\nThere have been reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF \nafter allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).\n\nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results. \n\nSpecial precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilisation\n\nMobilisation\n\nThere are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods \n(filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient \npopulation. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of \nCD34+ cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult \nto recommend an optimum method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in \nrelation to the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient. \n\nPrior exposure to cytotoxic agents\n\nPatients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient \nmobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (\u2265 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) or \nacceleration of platelet recovery, to the same degree. \n\nSome cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool, and may \nadversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU), and \ncarboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation \nmay reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or BCNU \ntogether with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation. When a PBPC\ntransplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan the stem cell mobilisation procedure early in the \ntreatment course of the patient. Particular attention should be paid to the number of progenitors \nmobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose chemotherapy. If yields are \ninadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of treatment, not requiring progenitor \nsupport should be considered. \n\nAssessment of progenitor cell yields\n\nIn assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular \nattention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of \nCD34+ cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and recommendations of \nnumbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution. \n\n\n\n10\n\nStatistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34+ cells re-infused and the rate of \nplatelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship. \n\nThe recommendation of a minimum yields of \u2265 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg is based on published \nexperience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this appear to \ncorrelate with more rapid recovery, those below with slower recovery. \n\nSpecial precautions in normal donors undergoing PBPC mobilisation\n\nMobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be \nconsidered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. \n\nPBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory \neligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious \ndisease. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim have not been assessed in normal donors < 16 years or > 60 years. \n\nTransient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim administration and \nleukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets \n< 50 x 109/L were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure. \n\nIf more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets \n< 100 x 109/L prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets \n< 75 x 109/L. \n\nLeukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects \nin haemostasis. \n\nDonors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until haematological indices \nreturn to normal. \n\nTransient cytogenetic abnormalities have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use. The \nsignificance of these changes is unknown. Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a malignant myeloid \nclone cannot be excluded. It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and \ntracking of the stem cell donors for at least 10 years to ensure monitoring of long-term safety. \n\nSpecial precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim\n\nCurrent data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the \nrecipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with \nbone marrow transplantation. \n\nSpecial precautions in SCN patients\n\nFilgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop \nleukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution.\n\nBlood cell counts\n\nOther blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, \nwhich require close monitoring of cell counts. \n\nTransformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome\n\nSpecial care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic \ndisorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell \n\n\n\n11\n\ncounts with differential and platelet counts, and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and \nkaryotype should be performed prior to treatment. \n\nThere was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in \nclinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in patients \nwith congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease and are of \nuncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had normal \ncytogenetic evaluations at baseline were subsequently found to have abnormalities, including \nmonosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of \npatients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic \ntransformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow \nexaminations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months). \n\nOther special precautions \n\nCauses of transient neutropenia, such as viral infections should be excluded. \n\nHaematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis \nshould be performed to monitor these events. \n\nThe safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been \nestablished.\n\nSpecial precautions in patients with HIV infection\n\nBlood cell counts\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks \nof filgrastim therapy. Some patients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in \nneutrophil count to the initial dose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for \nthe first 2-3 days of filgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured \nat least twice per week for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other \nweek during maintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 \u00b5g)/day of filgrastim, \nthere can be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a patient's trough \nor nadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately \nprior to any scheduled dosing with filgrastim. \n\nRisk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products\n\nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive medications. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater number \nof these medications with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of developing \nthrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see above). \n\nInfections and malignancies causing myelosuppression\n\nNeutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium \navium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow infiltrating \ninfections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition, in \naddition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on \nneutropenia due to bone marrow infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established. \n\nAll patients\n\nNivestim contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be \ngiven this medicine unless strictly necessary.\n\n\n\n12\n\nBabies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary fructose \nintolerance (HFI). Medicines (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be \nlife-threatening and should be contraindicated in this population unless there is an overwhelming \nclinical need and no alternatives are available. \n\nA detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given \nthis medicinal product.\n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.6 mg/ml or 0.96 mg/ml dose, that is to \nsay essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic \nchemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing \nmyeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended \nin the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small \nnumber of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-Fluorouracil indicates that the severity \nof neutropenia may be exacerbated. \n\nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been \ninvestigated in clinical trials. \n\nSince lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, lithium is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. \nAlthough this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an \ninteraction is harmful.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of embryo loss has been observed \nin rabbits at high multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in \npregnant women has been demonstrated. \n\nFilgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is unknown whether filgrastim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nFilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNivestim may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur \nfollowing the administration of filgrastim (see section 4.8).\n\n\n\n13\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\na. Summary of the safety profile\n\nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic \nreaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary \nleak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or\nleukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral \nblood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes \nbone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal \nchest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical trials in cancer patients \nmusculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients.\n\nb.

Description of selected adverse reactions\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nHypersensitivity-type reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea and \nhypotension occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been reported in clinical studies and in \npost-marketing experience. Overall, reports were more common after IV administration. In some \ncases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim should be \npermanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.\n\nPulmonary adverse events\n\nIn clinical studies and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse effects including interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an outcome of \nrespiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section \n4.4).\n\nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture\n\nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported following administration of filgrastim. \nSome cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4).\n\nCapillary leak syndrome\n\nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use. \nThese have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple \nchemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4).\n\n\n\n16\n\nCutaneous vasculitis\n\nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim. The mechanism of vasculitis \nin patients receiving filgrastim is unknown. During long-term use cutaneous vasculitis has been \nreported in 2% of SCN patients.\n\nLeucocytosis\n\nLeucocytosis (WBC > 50 x 109/L) was observed in 41% of normal donors and transient \nthrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim and leukapheresis was observed in \n35% of donors (see section 4.4).\n\nSweets syndrome\n\nCases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) have been reported in patients \ntreated with filgrastim.\n\nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate)\n\nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) has been reported in patients with cancer treated with \nfilgrastim.\n\nGvHD\n\nThere have been reports of GvHD and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone \nmarrow transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).\n\nd. Paediatric population\n\nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no age-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event was \nmusculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population.\n\nThere is insufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects. \n\ne. Other special populations\n\nGeriatric use\n\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age \ncompared to younger adult (> 18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical \nexperience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. \nThere is insufficient data to evaluate filgrastim use in geriatric subjects for other approved filgrastim\nindications.\n\nPaediatric SCN patients\n\nCases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe \nchronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim. \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n17\n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe effects of filgrastim overdosage have not been established.\n\nDiscontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils \nwithin 1 to 2 days, with a return to normal levels in 1 to 7 days.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cytokines, ATC code: L03AA02 \n\nNivestim is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.\n\nHuman G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils \nfrom the bone marrow. Nivestim containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in \nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within twenty four hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In \nsome SCN patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils \nand basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia \nalready prior to treatment. Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose dependent at recommended doses. \nNeutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by \ntests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating \nneutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 to 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 to 7 days. \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the \nincidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Treatment with filgrastim \nsignificantly reduces the durations of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after \ninduction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone \nmarrow transplantation. The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either \nsetting. The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed \nby bone marrow transplantation. \n\nUse of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into \nthe peripheral blood. These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high dose cytotoxic \ntherapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation. Infusion of PBPC accelerates \nhaematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and the need for \nplatelet transfusions. \n\nRecipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim experienced significantly more rapid \nhaematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time to unsupported platelet recovery \nwhen compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. \n\nOne retrospective European study evaluating the use of GCSF after allogeneic bone marrow \ntransplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment \nrelated mortality (TRM) and mortality when GCSF was administered. In a separate retrospective \nInternational study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of \nGvHD, TRM and mortality was seen. A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the \nresults of nine prospective randomized trials, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did \nnot detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n18\n\nRelative Risk (95% CI) of GvHD and TRM\nFollowing Treatment with GCSF after Bone Marrow Transplantation\n\nPublication\nPeriod of \n\nStudy\nN\n\nAcute Grade II \n- IV GvHD\n\nChronic \nGvHD\n\nTRM\n\nMeta-Analysis (2003) \n1986 \uf02d\n2001a\n\n1198\n1.08\n\n(0.87, 1.33)\n1.02\n\n(0.82, 1.26)\n0.70\n\n(0.38, 1.31)\n\nEuropean Retrospective \nStudy (2004) \n\n1992 \uf02d\n2002b\n\n1789\n1.33\n\n(1.08, 1.64)\n1.29\n\n(1.02, 1.61)\n1.73\n\n(1.30, 2.32)\n\nInternational \nRetrospective Study \n(2006) \n\n1995 \uf02d\n2000b\n\n2110\n1.11\n\n(0.86, 1.42)\n1.10\n\n(0.86, 1.39)\n1.26\n\n(0.95, 1.67)\n\na Analysis includes studies involving BM transplant during this period; some studies used GM-CSF.\nb Analysis includes patients receiving BM transplant during this period.\n\nUse of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC \ntransplantation\n\nIn normal donors, a 10 \u00b5g/kg/day dose administered subcutaneously for 4 to 5 consecutive days allows \na collection of \u2265 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient body weight in the majority of the donors after two \nleukapheresis.\n\nUse of filgrastim in patients, children or adults, with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic \nneutropenia) induces a sustained increase in absolute neutrophil counts in peripheral blood and a \nreduction of infection and related events. \n\nUse of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled \ndosing of antiviral and/or other myelosuppressive medication. There is no evidence that patients with \nHIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication. \n\nAs with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on \nhuman endothelial cells. \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nA randomised, open-label, single-dose, comparator-controlled, two-way crossover study in 46 healthy \nvolunteers showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of Nivestim was comparable to that of the \nreference product after subcutaneous and intravenous administration. Another randomised, \ndouble-blind, multiple-dose, comparator-controlled, two-way crossover study in 50 healthy volunteers \nshowed that the pharmacokinetic profile of Nivestim was comparable to that of the reference product \nafter subcutaneous administration.\n\nClearance of filgrastim has been shown to follow first-order pharmacokinetics after both subcutaneous \nand intravenous administration. The serum elimination half-life of filgrastim is approximately \n3.5 hours, with a clearance rate of approximately 0.6 ml/min/kg. Continuous infusion with filgrastim \nover a period of up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, \nresulted in no evidence of drug accumulation and comparable elimination half-lives. There is a \npositive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, whether \nadministered intravenously or subcutaneously. Following subcutaneous administration of \nrecommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained above 10 ng/ml for 8 to 16 hours. The \nvolume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 ml/kg.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nFilgrastim was studied in repeated dose toxicity studies up to 1 year in duration which revealed \nchanges attributable to the expected pharmacological actions including increases in leucocytes, \nmyeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, extramedullary granulopoiesis and splenic enlargement. These \nchanges all reversed after discontinuation of treatment.\n\n\n\n19\n\nEffects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. Intravenous \n(80 \u00b5g/kg/day) administration of filgrastim to rabbits during the period of organogenesis was \nmaternally toxic and increased spontaneous abortion, post-implantation loss, and decreased mean live \nlitter size and foetal weight were observed. \n\nBased on reported data for another filgrastim product similar to the originator, comparable findings \nplus increased foetal malformations were observed at 100 \u00b5g/kg/day, a maternally toxic dose which \ncorresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately 50-90 times the exposures observed in patients \ntreated with the clinical dose of 5 \u00b5g/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect level for embryo-foetal \ntoxicity in this study was 10 \u00b5g/kg/day, which corresponded to a systemic exposure of approximately \n3-5 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical dose.\n\nIn pregnant rats, no maternal or foetal toxicity was observed at doses up to 575 \u00b5g/kg/day. Offspring \nof rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods, exhibited a delay in external \ndifferentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 \u00b5g/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate \n(100 \u00b5g/kg/day). \n\nFilgrastim had no observed effect on the fertility of male or female rats.\n\n6.

You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.\n\nWhat is in this leaflet\n\n1. What Nivestim is and what it is used for\n2. What you need to know before you use Nivestim\n3. How to use Nivestim\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Nivestim\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Nivestim is and what it is used for\n\nNivestim is a white blood cell growth factor (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and belongs to a \ngroup of medicines called cytokines. Growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the \nbody but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. Nivestim works by \nencouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells.\n\nA reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes\nyour body less able to fight infection. Nivestim stimulates the bone marrow to produce new white cells \nquickly.\n\nNivestim can be used:\n- to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent\n\ninfections;\n- to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent\n\ninfections;\n- before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be\n\ncollected and given back to you after your treatment. These can be taken from you or from a\ndonor. The stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells;\n\n- to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help\nprevent infections;\n\n- in patients with advanced HIV infection which will help reduce the risk of infections.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Nivestim\n\nDo not use Nivestim\n\n- if you are allergic to filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).\n\n\n\n37\n\nWarnings and precautions\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nivestim.\n\nPlease tell your doctor before starting treatment if you have:\n- sickle cell anaemia, as Nivestim may cause sickle cell crisis.\n- osteoporosis (bone disease).\n\nPlease tell your doctor immediately during treatment with Nivestim, if you:\n\uf0b7 have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, \n\ntongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these \ncould be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity).\n\n\uf0b7 experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you \nnotice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis).\n\n\uf0b7 get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left\nshoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of\nthe spleen).\n\n\uf0b7 notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets\n(thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot).\n\nInflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) \nhas been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include fever, \nabdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you \nexperience these symptoms.\n\nLoss of response to filgrastim\n\nIf you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your\ndoctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which\nneutralise filgrastim\u2019s activity.\n\nYour doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet.\n\nIf you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the\nblood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)). You should talk to your doctor about your risks\nof developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. If you develop or are likely to\ndevelop cancers of the blood, you should not use Nivestim, unless instructed by your doctor.\n\nIf you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between 16 and 60 years.\n\nTake special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells\n\nNivestim is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. Your\nhealthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using.\n\nOther medicines and Nivestim\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\nNivestim has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women. \n\nNivestim is not recommended during pregnancy.\n\n\n\n38\n\nIt is important to tell your doctor if you:\n- are pregnant or breast-feeding;\n- think you may be pregnant; or \n- are planning to have a baby.\n\nIf you become pregnant during Nivestim treatment, please inform your doctor.\n\nUnless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Nivestim.\n\nDriving and using machines\n\nNivestim may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may \ncause dizziness. It is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking Nivestim and before driving \nor operating machinery.\n\nNivestim contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.6 mg/ml or 0.96 mg/ml dose, that is to \nsay essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.\n\nNivestim contains sorbitol\n\nThis medicine contains 50 mg sorbitol in each ml.\n\nSorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare \ngenetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI cannot break \ndown fructose, which may cause serious side effects.\n\nYou must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if your \nchild can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get unpleasant effects \nsuch as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea.\n\n3. How to use Nivestim\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nHow is Nivestim given and how much should I take?\n\nNivestim is usually given as a daily injection into the tissue just under the skin (known as a \nsubcutaneous injection). It can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an \nintravenous infusion). The usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. Your doctor will \ntell you how much Nivestim you should take.\n\nPatients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy:\nYou will normally receive your first dose of Nivestim at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy and at \nleast 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant.\n\nYou, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can \ncontinue your treatment at home. However, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly \ntrained first by your healthcare provider.\n\n\n\n39\n\nHow long will I have to take Nivestim?\n\nYou will need to take Nivestim until your white blood cell count is normal. Regular blood tests will be \ntaken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. Your doctor will tell you how long you \nwill need to take Nivestim.\n\nUse in children\n\nNivestim is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low\nwhite blood cell count (neutropenia). The dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the same as for \nadults.\n\nIf you use more Nivestim than you should\n\nDo not increase the dose your doctor has given you. If you think you have injected more than you \nshould, contact your doctor as soon as possible.\n\nIf you forget to use Nivestim\n\nIf you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not \ntake a double dose to make up for any missed doses.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nPlease tell your doctor immediately during treatment:\n- if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty\n\nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the\nface, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).\n\n- if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\n\n- if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). Kidney injury has been seen in patients\nwho received filgrastim. Call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or\nankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual.\n\n- if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:\no swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently,\n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of \ntiredness. These symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion.\n\nThese could be symptoms of a condition called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d which causes blood \nto leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention.\n\n- if you have a combination of any of the following symptoms:\no fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, \n\nshortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin.\nThese could be symptoms of a condition called \u201csepsis\u201d (also called \u201cblood poisoning\u201d), a \nsevere infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and \nneeds urgent medical attention.\n\n- if you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your \nshoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) \nor rupture of the spleen).\n\n- if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine \n(haematuria). Your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if \nprotein is found in your urine (proteinuria).\n\n\n\n40\n\nA common side effect of filgrastim use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which \ncan be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). In patients undergoing a stem cell \nor bone marrow transplant, Graft versus host disease (GvHD) may occur - this is a reaction of the \ndonor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms \nof your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, \nlungs, vagina and joints. \n\nIn normal stem cell donors, an increase in white blood cells (leucocytosis) and a decrease of platelets \nmay be seen. This reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). These will be \nmonitored by your doctor.\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia)\n\uf0b7 low red blood cell count (anaemia)\n\uf0b7 headache\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 vomiting\n\uf0b7 nausea\n\uf0b7 unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia)\n\uf0b7 tiredness (fatigue)\n\uf0b7 soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus \n\n(mucosal inflammation)\n\uf0b7 fever (pyrexia)\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lung (bronchitis)\n\uf0b7 upper respiratory tract infection\n\uf0b7 urinary tract infection\n\uf0b7 decreased appetite\n\uf0b7 trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n\uf0b7 dizziness\n\uf0b7 decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia)\n\uf0b7 tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia)\n\uf0b7 low blood pressure (hypotension)\n\uf0b7 high blood pressure (hypertension)\n\uf0b7 cough\n\uf0b7 coughing up blood (haemoptysis)\n\uf0b7 pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain)\n\uf0b7 nose bleeds (epistaxis)\n\uf0b7 constipation\n\uf0b7 oral pain\n\uf0b7 enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly)\n\uf0b7 rash\n\uf0b7 redness of the skin (erythema)\n\uf0b7 muscle spasm\n\uf0b7 pain when passing urine (dysuria)\n\uf0b7 chest pain\n\uf0b7 pain\n\uf0b7 generalised weakness (asthenia)\n\uf0b7 generally feeling unwell (malaise)\n\uf0b7 swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral)\n\uf0b7 increase of certain enzymes in the blood\n\uf0b7 changes in blood chemistry\n\uf0b7 transfusion reaction\n\n\n\n41\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):\n\uf0b7 increase in white blood cells (leucocytosis)\n\uf0b7 allergic reaction (hypersensitivity)\n\uf0b7 rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease)\n\uf0b7 high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (Blood uric acid\n\nincreased)\n\uf0b7 liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease)\n\uf0b7 lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure)\n\uf0b7 swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema)\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease)\n\uf0b7 abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration)\n\uf0b7 bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage)\n\uf0b7 lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia)\n\uf0b7 bumpy skin rash (rash maculo-papular)\n\uf0b7 disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely \n\nto break (osteoporosis)\n\uf0b7 injection site reaction\n\nRare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people):\n\uf0b7 severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle cell anaemia with crisis)\n\uf0b7 sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction)\n\uf0b7 pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout)\n\uf0b7 a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness (fluid\n\nvolume disturbances)\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis)\n\uf0b7 plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever\n\n(Sweets syndrome)\n\uf0b7 worsening of rheumatoid arthritis\n\uf0b7 unusual change in the urine \n\uf0b7 bone density decreased\n\uf0b7 inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \n\nbody), see section 2\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor \nor nurse. It is also important that you dispose of the syringe in a puncture-proof container. If you are \nnot sure about giving yourself the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse \nfor help.\n\nHow do I administer my Nivestim?\n\nNivestim is usually given once a day by injection, usually into the tissue just under the skin. This is \nknown as a subcutaneous injection.\n\nLearning to give your own injections will mean that you will not have to wait at home for a nurse to \ncall, nor will you have to go to the hospital or clinic every day to receive your injections.\n\nYou will need to have your injections at about the same time every day. The most suitable places for \ninjection are:\n\n\uf0b7 the front of the thighs, \n\uf0b7 the abdomen, except for the area around the navel. \n\nIt is better to change the injection site every day to avoid the risk of soreness at any one site.\n\nEquipment required for administration\n\nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need the following items:\n\uf0b7 A new pre-filled syringe of Nivestim.\n\uf0b7 A sharps container (puncture proof container) for disposing of used syringes safely.\n\uf0b7 Antiseptic wipes (if recommended by your doctor or nurse).\n\nHow do I give my subcutaneous Nivestim injection?\n\n1. Try to self-inject at approximately the same time every day.\n2. Remove the Nivestim syringe from the fridge and allow it to reach room temperature \n\n(approximately 25 \uf0b0C). This will take 15\u201330 minutes. Check the date on the pack to make \nsure that the medicine has not passed the expiry date. Make sure you have your sharps \ncontainer nearby.\n\n3. Find a comfortable well lit working place to give your injection and check the dose that \nyou have been prescribed.\n\n4. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n45\n\n5. Remove the syringe from the blister pack and check that the solution is clear, colourless \nand practically free from visible particles. Do not use the Nivestim syringe if the liquid has \nparticles floating in it or any of the liquid has leaked out of the syringe.\n\n6. Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards. Remove the protective cap from the \ninjection needle. The syringe is now ready for use. You may notice a small air bubble in \nthe syringe. You do not have to remove the air bubble before injecting. Injecting the \nsolution with an air bubble present is harmless.\n\n7. Decide where to inject Nivestim - find a place on the front of your abdomen or the front of \nyour thigh. Choose a different injection site each time. Do not choose an area which is \ntender, red, bruised or scarred. If your nurse or doctor recommends it, clean the area of \nskin with an antiseptic wipe.\n\n8. Pinch a large area of skin, taking care not to touch the area you have cleaned.\n9. With your other hand, insert the needle at an approximate 45\u02da angle.\n\n10. Pull the plunger back slightly to check if any blood appears in the syringe. If you do see \nblood inside the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in a different site. Slowly push \ndown the plunger until all the contents of the syringe have been emptied.\n\n11. After injecting the solution remove the needle from the skin. \n12. Ensure the needle guard covers the needle according to the instructions for active needle \n\nguard or passive needle guard below.\n13. Place the syringe into the sharps container. Do not try to replace the protective cap.\n\n\uf0b7 Keep used syringes out of the reach and sight of children\n\uf0b7 NEVER put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.\n\nRemember\n\nMost people can learn to give themselves a subcutaneous injection, but if you are experiencing a lot of \ndifficulty, please do not be afraid to ask for help and advice from your doctor or nurse.\n\nUse of Active UltraSafe Needle Guard for Nivestim 12 MU/0.2 ml solution for injection/infusion\n\nThe pre-filled syringe has an UltraSafe Needle Guard attached in order to protect from needle stick \ninjury. When handling the pre-filled syringe, keep hands behind the needle.\n\n1. Perform the injection using the technique described above.\n2. When you have completed the injection, slide the needle guard forward until the needle is \n\ncompletely covered (device \u2018clicks\u2019 into place). \n\n\n\n46\n\nUse of UltraSafe Passive Needle Guard for Nivestim 30 MU/0.5 ml solution for injection/infusion \nand Nivestim 48 MU/0.5 ml solution for injection/infusion\n\nThe pre-filled syringe has an UltraSafe Needle Guard attached in order to protect from needle stick \ninjury. When handling the pre-filled syringe, keep hands behind the needle.\n\n1. Perform the injection using the technique described above.\n\n2. Depress the plunger while grasping the finger flange until the entire dose has been given. The \npassive needle guard will NOT activate unless the ENTIRE dose has been given.\n\n3. Remove the needle from your skin, then let go of the plunger and allow the syringe to move up \nuntil the entire needle is guarded and locks into place.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n\nTHE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS INTENDED FOR MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE\nPROFESSIONALS ONLY:\n\nNivestim does not contain any preservative. In view of the possible risk of microbial contamination, \nNivestim syringes are for single use only.\n\nAccidental exposure to freezing temperatures for up to 24 hours does not affect the stability of \nNivestim. The frozen pre-filled syringes can be thawed and then refrigerated for future use. If exposure \nhas been greater than 24 hours or frozen more than once, then Nivestim should NOT be used.\n\nNivestim must not be diluted with sodium chloride solution. This medicinal product must not be mixed \nwith other medicinal products except those mentioned below. Diluted filgrastim may be adsorbed to \nglass and plastic materials except diluted, as mentioned below.\n\nIf required, Nivestim may be diluted in 5% glucose solution. Dilution to a final concentration less than \n0.2 MU (2 \uf06dg) per ml is not recommended at any time. The solution should be visually inspected prior \nto use. Only clear solutions without particles should be used. For patients treated with filgrastim \ndiluted to concentrations below 1.5 MU (15 \uf06dg) per ml, human serum albumin (HSA) should be added \nto a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. \n\nExample: In a final injection volume of 20 ml, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 \uf06dg) \nshould be given with 0.2 ml of 200 mg/ml (20%) human albumin solution added. When diluted in 5% \n\n\n\n47\n\nglucose solution, Nivestim is compatible with glass and a variety of plastics including PVC, polyolefin \n(a co-polymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and polypropylene.\n\nAfter dilution: Chemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution for infusion has been \ndemonstrated for 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should \nbe used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C, unless \ndilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.\n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

belongs to a group of medicines called cytokines. growth factors are proteins that are produced naturally in the body but they can also be made using biotechnology for use as a medicine. nivestim works by encouraging the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. a reduction in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) can occur for several reasons and makes your body less able to fight infection. nivestim stimulates the bone marrow to produce new white cells quickly. nivestim can be used: - to increase the number of white blood cells after treatment with chemotherapy to help prevent infections; - to increase the number of white blood cells after a bone marrow transplant to help prevent infections; - before high-dose chemotherapy to make the bone marrow produce more stem cells which can be collected and given back to you after your treatment. these can be taken from you or from a donor. the stem cells will then go back into the bone marrow and produce blood cells; - to increase the number of white blood cells if you suffer from severe chronic neutropenia to help prevent infections; - in patients with advanced hiv infection which will help reduce the risk of

disease). please tell your doctor immediately during treatment with nivestim, if you: have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing as these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction (hypersensitivity). experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual (glomerulonephritis). get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or at the tip of your left shoulder (these may be symptoms of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), or possibly rupture of the spleen). notice unusual bleeding or bruising (these may be symptoms of a decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), with a reduced ability of your blood to clot). inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. the symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. tell your doctor if you experience these symptoms. loss of response to filgrastim if you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with filgrastim treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which neutralise filgrastim's activity. your doctor may want to monitor you closely, see section 4 of the package leaflet. if you are a patient with severe chronic neutropenia, you may be at risk of developing cancer of the blood (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (mds)). you should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood and what testing should be done. if you develop or are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use nivestim, unless instructed by your doctor. if you are a stem cell donor, you must be aged between 16 and 60 years. take special care with other products that stimulate white blood cells nivestim is one of a group of products that stimulate the production of white blood cells. your healthcare professional should always record the exact product you are using. other medicines and nivestim tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding nivestim has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women. nivestim is not recommended during pregnancy. it is important to tell your doctor if you: - are pregnant or breast-feeding; - think you may be pregnant; or - are planning to have a baby. if you become pregnant during nivestim treatment, please inform your doctor. unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use nivestim. driving and using machines nivestim may have a minor influence on your ability to drive and use machines. this medicine may cause dizziness. it is advisable to wait and see how you feel after taking nivestim and before driving or operating machinery. nivestim contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.6 mg/ml or 0.96 mg/ml dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. nivestim contains sorbitol this medicine contains 50 mg sorbitol in each ml. sorbitol is a source of fructose. if you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi), a rare genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. patients with hfi cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.

the skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). it can also be given as a daily slow injection into the vein (known as an intravenous infusion). the usual dose varies depending on your illness and weight. your doctor will tell you how much nivestim you should take. patients having a bone marrow transplant after chemotherapy: you will normally receive your first dose of nivestim at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after receiving your bone marrow transplant. you, or people caring for you, can be taught how to give subcutaneous injections so that you can continue your treatment at home. however, you should not attempt this unless you have been properly trained first by your healthcare provider. how long will i have to take nivestim? you will need to take nivestim until your white blood cell count is normal. regular blood tests will be taken to monitor the number of white blood cells in your body. your doctor will tell you how long you will need to take nivestim. use in children nivestim is used to treat children who are receiving chemotherapy or who suffer from severe low white blood cell count (neutropenia). the dosing in children receiving chemotherapy is the same as for adults. if you use more nivestim than you should do not increase the dose your doctor has given you. if you think you have injected more than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible. if you forget to use nivestim if you have missed an injection, or injected too little, contact your doctor as soon as possible. do not take a double dose to make up for any missed doses. if you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nivestim", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":

{"Title": "4. possible side effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. please tell your doctor immediately during treatment: - if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), skin rash, itchy rash (urticaria), swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat (angioedema) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). - if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing (dyspnoea) as this can be a sign of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). - if you experience kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). kidney injury has been seen in patients who received filgrastim. call your doctor right away if you experience puffiness in your face or ankles, blood in your urine or brown-coloured urine or you notice you urinate less than usual. - if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: o swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of tiredness. these symptoms generally develop in a rapid fashion. these could be symptoms of a condition called \"capillary leak syndrome\" which causes blood to leak from the small blood vessels into your body and needs urgent medical attention. - if you have a combination of any of the following symptoms: o fever, or shivering, or feeling very cold, high heart rate, confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, extreme pain or discomfort and clammy or sweaty skin. these could be symptoms of a condition called \"sepsis\" (also called \"blood poisoning\"), a severe infection with whole-body inflammatory response which can be life threatening and needs urgent medical attention. - if you get left upper belly (abdominal) pain, pain below the left rib cage or pain at the tip of your shoulder, as there may be a problem with your spleen (enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) or rupture of the spleen). - if you are being treated for severe chronic neutropenia and you have blood in your urine (haematuria). your doctor may regularly test your urine if you experience this side effect or if protein is found in your urine (proteinuria). a common side effect of filgrastim use is pain in your muscles or bones (musculoskeletal pain), which can be helped by taking standard pain relief medicines (analgesics). in patients undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, graft versus host disease (gvhd) may occur - this is a reaction of the donor cells against the patient receiving the transplant; signs and symptoms include rash on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet and ulcer and sores in your mouth, gut, liver, skin, or your eyes, lungs, vagina and joints. in normal stem cell donors, an increase in white blood cells (leucocytosis) and a decrease of platelets may be seen. this reduces the ability of your blood to clot (thrombocytopenia). these will be monitored by your doctor. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): decrease of platelets which reduces the ability of blood to clot (thrombocytopenia) low red blood cell count (anaemia) headache diarrhoea vomiting nausea unusual hair loss or thinning (alopecia) tiredness (fatigue) soreness and swelling of the digestive tract lining which runs from the mouth to the anus (mucosal inflammation) fever (pyrexia) common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): inflammation of the lung (bronchitis) upper respiratory tract infection urinary tract infection decreased appetite trouble sleeping (insomnia) dizziness decreased feeling of sensitivity, especially in the skin (hypoaesthesia) tingling or numbness of the hands or feet (paraesthesia) low blood pressure (hypotension) high blood pressure (hypertension) cough coughing up blood (haemoptysis) pain in your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal pain) nose bleeds (epistaxis) constipation oral pain enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) rash redness of the skin (erythema) muscle spasm pain when passing urine (dysuria) chest pain pain generalised weakness (asthenia) generally feeling unwell (malaise) swelling in the hands and feet (oedema peripheral) increase of certain enzymes in the blood changes in blood chemistry transfusion reaction 41 uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): increase in white blood cells (leucocytosis) allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) rejection of transplanted bone marrow (graft versus host disease) high uric acid levels in the blood, which may cause gout (hyperuricaemia) (blood uric acid increased) liver damage caused by blocking of the small veins within the liver (veno-occlusive disease) lungs do not function as they should, causing breathlessness (respiratory failure) swelling and/or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) abnormal x-rays of the lungs (lung infiltration) bleeding from the lung (pulmonary haemorrhage) lack of absorption of oxygen in the lung (hypoxia) bumpy skin rash (rash maculo-papular) disease which causes bones to become less dense, making them weaker, more brittle and likely to break (osteoporosis) injection site reaction rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): severe pain in the bones, chest, gut or joints (sickle cell anaemia with crisis) sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) pain and swelling of the joints, similar to gout (pseudogout) a change in how your body regulates fluids within your body and may result in puffiness (fluid volume disturbances) inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous vasculitis) plum-coloured, raised, painful sores on the limbs and sometimes the face and neck with a fever (sweets syndrome) worsening of rheumatoid arthritis unusual change in the urine bone density decreased inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body), see section 2 reporting of side effects if you get any
