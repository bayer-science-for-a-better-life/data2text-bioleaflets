CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis \n\nof peanut allergy. PALFORZIA may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA should be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nThis medicine should be administered under the supervision of a health care professional qualified in \n\nthe diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. \n\n \n\nInitial dose escalation and the first dose of each new up-dosing level are to be administered in a health \n\ncare setting prepared to manage potential severe allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nSelf-injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) must be available to the patient at all times. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTreatment with PALFORZIA is administered in 3 sequential phases: Initial dose escalation, up-dosing, \n\nand maintenance.  \n\n \n\nFor each dose level during up-dosing, the doses given in clinic and at home should be from the same \n\nbatch to avoid variations in the potency range (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nThe dose configurations for each phase of dosing are provided in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. \n\n \n\nA dose level can be considered tolerated if no more than transient symptoms are observed with no or \n\nminimal medical intervention/therapy required. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nInitial dose escalation phase \n\n \n\nInitial dose escalation is administered on a single day under the supervision of a health care \n\nprofessional in a health care setting with the ability to manage potentially severe allergic reactions, \n\nincluding anaphylaxis.  \n\n \n\nInitial dose escalation is administered in sequential order on a single day beginning at 0.5 mg and \n\ncompleting with 6 mg (see Table 1).  \n\n \n\nTable 1:  Dose and capsule presentation for initial dose escalation \n\nDose Capsule presentation per dose \n\n0.5 mg 1 × 0.5 mg capsule \n\n1 mg 1 × 1 mg capsule \n\n1.5 mg 1 × 0.5 mg capsule + 1 × 1 mg capsule \n\n3 mg 3 × 1 mg capsules \n\n6 mg 6 × 1 mg capsules \n\n \n\nEach dose should be separated by an observation period of 20 to 30 minutes.  \n\n \n\nNo dose level should be omitted.  \n\n \n\nPatients must be observed after the last dose for at least 60 minutes until suitable for discharge.  \n\n \n\nTreatment must be discontinued if symptoms requiring medical intervention (e.g., use of adrenaline) \n\noccur with any dose during initial dose escalation. \n\n \n\nPatients who tolerate at least the 3 mg single dose PALFORZIA during initial dose escalation must \n\nreturn to the health care setting for initiation of up-dosing. \n\n \n\nIf possible, up-dosing should begin the day after initial dose escalation.  \n\n \n\nIf the patient is unable to begin up-dosing within 4 days, initial dose escalation should be repeated in a \n\nhealth care setting. \n\n \n\nUp-dosing phase \n\n \n\nInitial dose escalation must be completed before starting up-dosing. \n\n \n\nUp-dosing consists of 11 dose levels and is initiated at a 3 mg dose (see Table 2).  \n\n \n\nThe first dose of each new up-dosing level is administered under the supervision of a health care \n\nprofessional in a health care setting with the ability to manage potentially severe allergic reactions, \n\nincluding anaphylaxis. Patients should be observed for at least 60 minutes after administering the first \n\ndose of a new up-dosing level until suitable for discharge.  \n\n \n\nIf the patient tolerates the first dose of the increased dose level, the patient may continue that dose \n\nlevel at home.  \n\n \n\nAll the dose levels in Table 2 must be administered in sequential order at 2-week intervals if tolerated. \n\nNo dose level should be omitted. Patients must not progress through up-dosing more rapidly than \n\nshown in Table 2.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nTable 2:  Daily dosing configuration for up-dosing \n\nDose level \n\nTotal \n\ndaily dose Presentation of dose (capsule colour) \n\nDose duration \n\n(weeks) \n\n1 3 mg 3 × 1 mg capsules (red) 2 \n\n2 6 mg 6 × 1 mg capsules (red) 2 \n\n3 12 mg 2 × 1 mg capsules (red)  \n\n1 × 10 mg capsule (blue) \n\n2 \n\n4 20 mg 1 × 20 mg capsule (white) 2 \n\n5 40 mg 2 × 20 mg capsules (white) 2 \n\n6 80 mg 4 × 20 mg capsules (white) 2 \n\n7 120 mg 1 × 20 mg capsule (white)  \n\n1 × 100 mg capsule (red) \n\n2 \n\n8 160 mg 3 × 20 mg capsules (white) \n\n1 × 100 mg capsule (red) \n\n2 \n\n9 200 mg 2 × 100 mg capsules (red) 2 \n\n10 240 mg 2 × 20 mg capsules (white)  \n\n2 × 100 mg capsules (red) \n\n2 \n\n11 300 mg 1 × 300 mg sachet 2 \n\n \n\nNo more than one dose should be consumed per day. Patients should be instructed not to consume a \n\ndose at home on the same day as a dose consumed in the clinic. \n\n \n\nCare should be taken to ensure that patients have only one dose level in their possession at any time. \n\n \n\nDose modification or discontinuation should be considered for patients who do not tolerate up-dosing \n\nas described in Table 2 (see Dose modification instructions).  \n\n \n\nMaintenance therapy \n\n \n\nAll dose levels of up-dosing must be completed before starting maintenance.  \n\n \n\nThe maintenance dose of PALFORZIA is 300 mg daily.  \n\n \n\nTable 3:  Daily dosing configuration for maintenance \n\nPresentation of dose Total daily dose \n\n1 × 300 mg sachet 300 mg \n\n \n\nDaily maintenance is required to maintain the tolerability and clinical effects of PALFORZIA.  \n\n \n\nEfficacy data currently are available for up to 24 months of treatment with PALFORZIA. No \n\nrecommendation can be made about the duration of treatment beyond 24 months. \n\n \n\nThe effect of stopping treatment on maintenance of clinical efficacy has not been evaluated.  \n\n \n\nIf treatment with PALFORZIA is stopped, patients must continue to carry self-injectable adrenaline at \n\nall times.   \n\n \n\nDose modification instructions \n\n \n\nDose modifications are not appropriate during initial dose escalation. \n\n \n\nTemporary dose modification of PALFORZIA may be required for patients who experience allergic \n\nreactions during up-dosing or maintenance or for practical reasons for patient management. Allergic \n\nreactions, including gastrointestinal reactions, that are severe, recurrent, bothersome, or last longer \n\nthan 90 minutes during up-dosing or maintenance should be actively managed with dose \n\nmodifications. Clinical judgment should be used to determine the best course of action on a patient by \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\npatient basis. This can include maintaining the dose level for longer than 2 weeks, reducing, or \n\nwithholding PALFORZIA doses.  \n\n \n\nManagement of consecutive missed doses \n\n \n\nMissed doses of PALFORZIA may pose a significant risk to patients due to potential loss of \n\ndesensitisation. The guidelines in Table 4 are to be used for managing missed doses. \n\n \n\nTable 4:  Management of consecutive missed doses \n\nConsecutive missed doses Action \n\n1 to 2 days Patients may resume treatment at the same dose level at home. \n\n3 to 4 days Patients may resume treatment at the same dose level under \n\nmedical supervision in a health care setting based on medical \n\njudgment. \n\n5 to 14 days Patients may resume up-dosing with PALFORZIA under \n\nmedical supervision in a health care setting at a dose of 50% or \n\nless of the last tolerated dose. \n\nGreater than 14 days Patient compliance should be evaluated and it should be \n\nconsidered to re-start up-dosing at 3 mg under supervision in \n\na health care setting or to discontinue treatment completely.  \n\n \n\nFollowing a dose reduction due to missed doses, up-dosing should be resumed as described in Table 2. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of PALFORZIA therapy initiated in patients aged over 17 years has not been \n\nestablished. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of PALFORZIA therapy in children aged less than 4 years have not yet been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nThe powder must be taken orally after mixing with an age-appropriate soft food. \n\n \n\nCapsules are not to be ingested. Inhalation of the powder must be avoided. \n\n \n\nTo empty the contents of each capsule, the two ends of the capsule should be pulled apart gently, and \n\ngently rolled between the finger and thumb. Sachets should be opened by carefully cutting or tearing \n\nalong the line indicated. \n\n \n\nThe entire dose of PALFORZIA powder should be emptied onto a few spoonfuls of refrigerated or \n\nroom temperature semisolid food (e.g., fruit puree, yogurt, rice-pudding) and mixed well. Liquid \n\n(e.g., milk, water, juice) must not be used. \n\n \n\nHands should be washed immediately after handling PALFORZIA capsule(s) or sachets. \n\n \n\nEach dose taken at home should be consumed daily with a meal at approximately the same time each \n\nday, preferably in the evening. PALFORZIA should not be taken on an empty stomach or after fasting.  \n\n \n\nAlcohol should not be taken for 2 hours before or 2 hours after a dose (see section 4.4, Table 5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Current severe or uncontrolled asthma \n\n• A history of, or current, eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE); other eosinophilic gastrointestinal \n\ndisease; chronic, recurrent, or severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); dysphagia \n\n• A history of, or current, severe mast cell disorder \n\n• Severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis within 60 days before initiating treatment with \n\nPALFORZIA  \n\n• Hypersensitivity to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is not intended for, and does not provide, immediate relief of allergic symptoms. \n\nTherefore, this medicinal product is not to be used for emergency treatment of allergic reactions, \n\nincluding anaphylaxis. \n\n \n\nPatients should not have active wheezing, uncontrolled severe atopic disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis or \n\neczema), a flare of atopic disease or suspected intercurrent illness prior to initiation of therapy. \n\n \n\nTraceability \n\n \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nAdrenaline \n\n \n\nSelf-injectable adrenaline must be prescribed to patients receiving this medicinal product. Patients \n\nmust be instructed to carry self-injectable adrenaline at all times. Patients and caregivers must be \n\ninstructed to recognise the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction and in the proper use of self-\n\ninjectable adrenaline. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical care upon its use and to \n\nstop treatment until they have been evaluated by a physician. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA may not be suitable for patients who are taking medications that can inhibit or potentiate \n\nthe effect of adrenaline (see the SmPC of adrenaline for further information). \n\n \n\nSystemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis \n\n \n\nWhen treated with PALFORZIA, peanut-allergic patients are exposed to peanut allergens that cause \n\nallergic symptoms. Therefore, allergic reactions to this medicinal product are expected in these \n\npatients. These reactions mostly occur during the first 2 hours after ingestion of the dose and are \n\nusually mild or moderate; however, more severe reactions may occur. Patients aged 12 years or older \n\nand/or with high sensitivity to peanut may be at higher risk of experiencing allergic symptoms during \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nDose modifications should be considered for patients who experience moderate or severe adverse \n\nallergic reactions to PALFORZIA. For dose modification instructions, see section 4.2. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA can cause systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, which may be life-\n\nthreatening.  \n\n \n\nSevere adverse reactions such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, changes in voice or \n\nfeeling of fullness in the throat, dizziness or fainting, severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting, \n\ndiarrhoea, or severe flushing or itching of the skin require immediate treatment, including use of \n\nadrenaline and subsequent medical evaluation. \n\n \n\nPatients must be educated to recognise the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions. Patients and \n\ncaregivers should be instructed to contact a health care professional before administering the next dose \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nof PALFORZIA if symptoms of an escalating or persistent allergic reaction occur. Any reaction must \n\nbe treated promptly (e.g., with self-administration of intramuscular adrenaline) in case a severe \n\nadverse reaction develops and immediate medical attention should be sought directly afterwards. In \n\nthe emergency department, treatment should follow the anaphylaxis guidelines. \n\n \n\nPatients may be more likely to experience allergy symptoms after dosing of PALFORZIA in the \n\npresence of a medical event such as an intercurrent illness (e.g., viral infection), exacerbation of \n\nasthma, or in the presence of other co-factors (e.g., exercise, menstruation, stress, fatigue, sleep \n\ndeprivation, fasting, intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol). Patients should be \n\ncounselled proactively about the potential for the increased risk of anaphylaxis in the presence of these \n\nco-factors, which may be modifiable or non-modifiable. On an individual basis and when needed, the \n\ntime of dosing should be adjusted to avoid modifiable cofactors. If it is not possible to avoid any of the \n\nmodifiable cofactors or if affected by non-modifiable co-factors, withholding or decreasing the \n\nPALFORZIA dose temporarily should be considered. Table 5 provides guidance on recommended \n\nactions to mitigate the risks associated with co-factors whilst on treatment. \n\n \n\nTable 5:  Guidelines on management of co-factors \n\nModifiable co-factors Recommended action to be taken \n\nHot bath or shower Hot showers or baths should be avoided immediately prior to or \n\nfollowing 3 hours of treatment. \n\nExercise Exercise should be avoided immediately prior to or for 3 hours \n\nfollowing treatment. \n\nAfter strenuous exercise signs of a hypermetabolic state \n\n(e.g., flushing, sweating, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate) must \n\nhave subsided before taking a dose. \n\nFasting or empty stomach Each dose should be consumed with a meal. \n\nAlcohol Alcohol should not be taken for 2 hours before or 2 hours after \n\na dose. \n\nIntake of non-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory medicines \n\nThe potential for allergic reactions to occur if taking non-\n\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines whilst on PALFORZIA \n\ntreatment should be considered.  \n\nNon-modifiable co-factors \n\nIntercurrent illness Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice before \n\ntaking their next dose of PALFORZIA. Exacerbation of asthma \n\nMenstruation Withholding or decreasing the PALFORZIA dose temporarily \n\nshould be considered based on individual patient needs. Stress \n\nFatigue or sleep deprivation \n\n \n\nDesensitisation response \n\n \n\nStrict daily, long-term dosing in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet is required to achieve \n\ndesensitisation and maintain the treatment effect of PALFORZIA. Treatment interruptions, including \n\nnon-daily dosing, may potentially lead to an increased risk of allergic reactions or even anaphylaxis. \n\n \n\nAs with any immunotherapy treatment, clinically meaningful desensitisation may not occur in all \n\npatients (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nAsthma \n\n \n\nIn patients with asthma, treatment may only be initiated when the asthma status is controlled. \n\nTreatment should be temporarily withheld if the patient is experiencing an acute asthma exacerbation. \n\nFollowing resolution of the exacerbation, resumption of PALFORZIA should be undertaken \n\ncautiously. Patients who have recurrent asthma exacerbations should be re-evaluated and \n\ndiscontinuation considered. This medicinal product has not been studied in patients on long-term \n\nsystemic corticosteroid therapy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nConcomitant illnesses \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product may not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions that may \n\nreduce the ability to survive a severe allergic reaction or increase the risk of adverse reactions after \n\nadrenaline administration. Examples of these medical conditions include, but are not limited to, \n\nmarkedly compromised lung function (chronic or acute; e.g., severe cystic fibrosis), unstable angina, \n\nrecent myocardial infarction, significant arrhythmias, cyanotic congenital heart disease, uncontrolled \n\nhypertension, and inherited metabolic disorders. \n\n \n\nGastro-intestinal adverse reactions including eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) \n\n \n\nIf patients develop chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, dose modification may be \n\nconsidered (see section 4.2). EoE has been reported in association with PALFORZIA (see section 4.8). \n\nFor chronic/recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, especially upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, \n\nvomiting, dysphagia), the potential for a diagnosis of EoE should be considered. In patients who \n\nexperience severe or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including dysphagia, gastroesophageal \n\nreflux, chest pain, or abdominal pain, treatment must be discontinued and a diagnosis of EoE should \n\nbe considered. \n\n \n\nConcomitant allergen immunotherapy \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product has not been studied in patients receiving concomitant allergen \n\nimmunotherapy. Caution should be exercised when administering this medicinal product in \n\nconjunction with other allergen immunotherapies as the potential for severe allergic reactions may be \n\nenhanced.  \n\n \n\nOral inflammation or wounds \n\n \n\nPatients with acute severe inflammation of the mouth or oesophagus, or with oral wounds may be at \n\ngreater risk of severe systemic allergic reactions following ingestion of peanut protein. Initiation of \n\ntreatment should be postponed in these patients and ongoing treatment should be temporarily \n\ninterrupted to allow healing of the oral cavity. \n\n \n\nChronic urticaria \n\n \n\nChronic urticaria, especially in the presence of severe exacerbations may confound the safety \n\nassessment of treatment. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed. Interactions with other medicinal products are not \n\nexpected. \n\n \n\nSevere allergic reactions may be treated with adrenaline (see section 4.4). Please refer to the SmPC for \n\nadrenaline for further information on medicines that may potentiate or inhibit the effects of adrenaline. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data from defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nInitiation of treatment with PALFORZIA is not recommended during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nTreatment with this medicinal product may cause anaphylaxis, which is a risk to pregnant women. \n\nAnaphylaxis can cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, which could result in compromised \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nplacental perfusion and significant risk to a foetus during pregnancy. In addition, the effect of oral \n\nimmunotherapy (OIT) on the immune system of the mother and foetus during pregnancy is unknown. \n\n \n\nFor patients who are established on OIT and become pregnant, the benefits of remaining on OIT and \n\nretaining desensitisation should be weighed against the risks of an anaphylactic reaction while \n\nremaining on OIT. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nPeanut allergens have been found in human milk after consumption of peanuts. There are no data \n\navailable on the effects of PALFORZIA on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The \n\ndevelopmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother’s \n\nclinical need for treatment and any other potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from \n\nPALFORZIA or from the underlying maternal condition. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere are no specific clinical or nonclinical data on the effects of defatted powder of Arachis \n\nhypogaea L., semen (peanuts) on fertility. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Caution should be \n\nexercised for 2 hours after dosing in case any symptoms of an allergic reaction occur that could impact \n\nthe ability to drive or use machines.  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions (of any severity) are abdominal pain (49.4%), throat irritation \n\n(40.7%), pruritus (33.7%), nausea (33.2%), vomiting (28.5%), urticaria (28.5%), oral pruritus (26.0%), \n\nabdominal discomfort (22.9%), and abdominal pain upper (22.8%).  \n\n \n\nThe incidence of adverse reactions was higher during up-dosing (85.7%) than initial dose escalation \n\n(45.1%) and maintenance (57.7%).  \n\n \n\nThe median time from administration of PALFORZIA in a clinical setting to onset of the first \n\nsymptom ranged from 4 to 8 minutes. The median time from onset of the first symptom to resolution \n\nof the last symptom ranged from 15 to 30 minutes. \n\n \n\n10.5% of subjects discontinued study product due to 1 or more adverse reactions. The most common \n\nadverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment were abdominal pain (3.8%), vomiting \n\n(2.5%), nausea (1.9%), and systemic allergic reaction (1.6%), including anaphylaxis. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nTable 6 is based on data from clinical trials. Listed adverse reactions are divided into groups according \n\nto the MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequency categories are defined as: Very \n\ncommon (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000), and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are \n\npresented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nTable 6:  Adverse reactions \n\nMedDRA system organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nImmune system disorders Very common Anaphylactic reaction (systemic allergic \n\nreaction; any severity)   \n\nCommon Anaphylactic reaction, severe (anaphylaxis; \n\nsystemic allergic reaction, severe)  \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nVery common Throat tightness \n\nCough \n\nSneezing \n\nThroat irritation \n\nCommon Dyspnoea \n\nWheezing \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Vomiting \n\nAbdominal pain \n\nAbdominal pain upper \n\nNausea \n\nAbdominal discomfort \n\nParaesthesia oral \n\nOral pruritus \n\nLip pruritus \n\nUncommon Eosinophilic oesophagitis \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\nVery common Urticaria \n\nPruritus \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nSystemic allergic reactions (Anaphylactic reactions)  \n\n \n\nFor the purpose of reporting the clinical study results, the term systemic allergic reaction is used to \n\ndescribe anaphylactic reaction events of any severity and the term anaphylaxis is used to distinguish \n\nanaphylactic reaction events that were severe. \n\n \n\nSystemic allergic reactions of any severity were reported in 15.1% of subjects, including 0.6% during \n\ninitial dose escalation, 8.7% during up-dosing, and 9.9% during maintenance. The majority of subjects \n\nwho had systemic allergic reactions had reactions of mild or moderate severity. Severe systemic \n\nallergic reaction (anaphylaxis) was reported in 10 subjects (1.1% overall), including 4 subjects (0.4%) \n\nduring up-dosing and 6 (0.8%) during maintenance at 300 mg/day. 1.6% discontinued due to systemic \n\nallergic reaction including 0.3% with anaphylaxis. Of the total population, 10.6% of subjects reported \n\na single episode of systemic allergic reaction and 4.6% reported two or more systemic allergic \n\nreactions. Existing data suggest an increased risk of systemic allergic reaction for adolescents (21.9%) \n\nthan for children (≤ 11 years; 11.9%). \n\n \n\nIn the clinical trials, the most commonly reported symptoms of systemic allergic reactions included \n\nskin disorders (urticaria, flushing, pruritis, face swelling, rash), respiratory disorders (dyspnea, \n\nwheezing, cough, throat tightness, rhinorrhea, throat irritation), and gastrointestinal disorders \n\n(abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting). The onset of most (87.0%) episodes of systemic allergic reaction \n\nwas within 2 hours of the administration of the medication. \n\n \n\nAdrenaline use \n\n \n\nIn the PALFORZIA safety population, 14.9% of subjects reported at least one episode of adrenaline \n\nuse for any reason. 1.8% of patients reported at least one episode during initial dose escalation, \n\n9.1% during up-dosing, and 8.7% during maintenance. Of subjects who reported adrenaline usage, \n\n91.6% subjects required a single dose and 92.5% of adrenaline usage was for events of mild to \n\nmoderate severity. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nEosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) \n\n \n\nIn clinical trials, 12 out of 1,217 subjects were diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed eosinophilic \n\noesophagitis while receiving PALFORZIA compared with 0 of 443 subjects receiving placebo. After \n\ndiscontinuation of PALFORZIA, symptomatic improvement was reported in 12 of 12 subjects. In \n\n8 subjects with available follow-up biopsy results, eosinophilic oesophagitis was resolved in 6 subjects \n\nand improved in 2 subjects.  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nAdministration of PALFORZIA at greater than recommended doses in peanut-allergic patients \n\nincreases the risk of side effects, including the risk of systemic allergic reactions or severe \n\nsingle-organ allergic reactions. In the event of anaphylaxis at home, patients should self-administer \n\nintramuscular adrenaline and follow-up with an emergency medical evaluation. In an emergency \n\ndepartment, the anaphylaxis guidelines should be followed. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

This food challenge was \n\nperformed according to the Practical Allergy (PRACTALL) guidelines with modification to include a \n\n600 mg protein dose (between the 300 mg and 1,000 mg challenge doses). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nThe efficacy of PALFORZIA was assessed in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, \n\nmulticentre, phase 3 pivotal studies PALISADE and ARTEMIS. Both studies recruited subjects with \n\na documented history of peanut allergy. Subjects with a severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis event \n\nwithin 60 days of study entry and those with severe or uncontrolled asthma were excluded from the \n\nstudies. After an initial dose escalation ranging from 0.5 mg to 6 mg on day 1 and confirmation of \n\ntolerability of the 3 mg dose on day 2, subjects underwent up-dosing for 20 to 40 weeks starting at \n\n3 mg until the 300 mg dose was reached. The Up-Dosing period varied for each subject depending on \n\ndoses tolerated. Subjects then underwent 6 months (PALISADE) or 3 months (ARTEMIS) of \n\nmaintenance immunotherapy with 300 mg PALFORZIA or placebo until the end of the study when \n\nsubjects completed an exit DBPCFC to assess desensitisation to peanut. \n\n \n\nPALISADE recruited subjects aged 4 to 55 years in Europe and North America. A total of \n\n750 subjects aged 4 to 17 years were screened and 499 were randomly assigned (3:1) to study \n\ntreatment (374 to PALFORZIA and 125 to placebo). The primary efficacy analysis population \n\nconsisted of 496 subjects aged 4 to 17 years who received at least one dose of study treatment. In this \n\nstudy, eligible subjects were those sensitive to ≤ 100 mg of peanut protein at the screening DBPCFC. \n\nOf the subjects treated with PALFORZIA in the primary analysis population, 72% had a medical \n\nhistory of allergic rhinitis, 66% reported multiple food allergies, 63% had a medical history of atopic \n\ndermatitis, and 53% had a present or previous diagnosis of asthma. The median age of subjects was \n\n9 years. More than half of the subjects were male (56%) and most subjects were white (78%).  \n\n \n\nARTEMIS recruited subjects aged 4 to 17 years of age in Europe. A total of 175 subjects aged \n\n4 to 17 years were randomly assigned (3:1) to study treatment (132 to PALFORZIA and 43 to \n\nplacebo). The primary efficacy analysis population consisted of 175 subjects aged 4 to 17 years who \n\nreceived at least one dose of study treatment. In this study, eligible subjects were those sensitive to \n\n≤ 300 mg of peanut protein at the screening DBPCFC. Of the subjects treated with PALFORZIA in \n\nthe primary analysis group, 61% reported multiple food allergies, 59% had a medical history of atopic \n\ndermatitis, 48% had a medical history of allergic rhinitis, and 42% had a present or previous diagnosis \n\nof asthma. The median age of subjects was 8.0 years. More than half of the subjects were male (52%) \n\nand most subjects were white (82%).  \n\n \n\nEfficacy data \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both PALISADE and ARTEMIS was the proportion of subjects aged \n\n4 to 17 years who tolerated a single highest dose of at least 1,000 mg peanut protein with no more than \n\nmild allergic symptoms at the exit DBPCFC (desensitisation response rate). Key secondary endpoints \n\nin this age group included determination of the desensitisation response rates after single doses of \n\n300 mg and 600 mg peanut protein and the maximum severity of symptoms at the exit DBPCFC. \n\n \n\nDesensitisation response rates \n\n \n\nThe summary of desensitisation response rates for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for the \n\nintention to treat (ITT) population in both PALISADE and ARTEMIS are provided in Table 9. \n\nSubjects without an exit DBPCFC were counted as non-responders. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nTable 9:  PALISADE and ARTEMIS: Summary of desensitisation response rates for primary \n\nand key secondary efficacy endpoints (ITT population, 4-17 years) \n\nEndpoint \n\nPALISADE ARTEMIS \n\nPALFORZIA \n\nN = 372 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN = 124 \n\nPALFORZIA \n\nN = 132 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN = 43 \n\nPrimary efficacy endpoint \n\nResponse rate: proportion of subjects \n\nwho tolerated 1,000 mg peanut \n\nprotein (95% CI) [1] \n\n50.3%  \n\n(45.2, 55.3) \n\n2.4%  \n\n(0.8, 6.9) \n\n58.3%  \n\n(49.4, 66.8) \n\n2.3%  \n\n(0.1, 12.3) \n\nP-value [2] < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n\nKey secondary efficacy endpoints \n\nResponse rate: proportion of subjects \n\nwho tolerated 600 mg peanut protein \n\n(95% CI) [1] \n\n67.2%  \n\n(62.3, 71.8) \n\n4.0%  \n\n(1.7, 9.1) \n\n68.2%  \n\n(59.5, 76.0) \n\n9.3%  \n\n(2.6, 22.1) \n\nP-value [2] < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n\nResponse rate: proportion of subjects \n\nwho tolerated 300 mg peanut protein \n\n(95% CI) [1] \n\n76.6%  \n\n(72.1, 80.6) \n\n8.1%  \n\n(4.4, 14.2) \n\n73.5%  \n\n(65.1, 80.8) \n\n16.3%  \n\n(6.8, 30.7) \n\nP-value [2] < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n\n[1] PALISADE: Based on Wilson (score) confidence limits, ARTEMIS: Based on exact Clopper-\n\nPearson interval. \n\n[2] PALISADE: Based on the Farrington-Manning confidence limits.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What PALFORZIA is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA contains peanut protein from defatted powder of peanut seed. It is a treatment for people \n\nwho are allergic to peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.).  \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is intended for children and young people aged from 4 to 17 years and those who \n\nbecome adults whilst on treatment. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA works in people with peanut allergy by gradually increasing the body’s ability to \n\ntolerate small amounts of peanut (desensitisation). PALFORZIA can help reduce the severity of \n\nallergic reactions after coming into contact with peanut. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is not effective against any other nut or food allergies. \n\n \n\nYou must continue to strictly avoid eating peanuts while taking PALFORZIA. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take PALFORZIA \n\n \n\nDo not take PALFORZIA \n\n- if you are allergic to any of the excipients (other ingredients) in this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\n- if you have severe asthma or if your asthma is not under control (as assessed by a doctor). \n\n- if you have ever had a problem swallowing or long term problems with your digestive system. \n\n- if you have ever had a severe mast cell disorder (as assessed by a doctor). \n\n- if you had severe or life-threatening anaphylaxis within 60 days before starting treatment. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n  \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking PALFORZIA and tell your doctor about any medical conditions that \n\nyou have. \n\n \n\nYou must not take any peanut or peanut containing food in your diet whilst taking PALFORZIA. \n\n \n\nIt is important to keep a record of the batch number of your PALFORZIA. So, every time you get a \n\nnew package of PALFORZIA, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging \n\nafter “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA does not treat the symptoms of peanut allergy and you must not take \n\nPALFORZIA during an allergic reaction. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will advise the best time to start treatment depending on any medical conditions that you \n\nhave.  \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA contains the substance that patients with peanut allergy react to. Allergic reactions to \n\nPALFORZIA may occur during treatment. These reactions mostly occur during the first two hours \n\nafter taking a PALFORZIA dose and are usually mild or moderate but ocasionally can be severe. \n\n \n\nStop taking PALFORZIA and get medical treatment straight away if you have any of the following \n\nsymptoms: \n\n- Trouble breathing \n\n- Throat tightness or feeling of fulness in throat  \n\n- Trouble swallowing \n\n- Change in voice  \n\n- Dizziness or fainting or feeling of impending doom \n\n- Severe stomach cramps or pain, vomiting or diarrhoea \n\n- Severe flushing or itching of the skin \n\n- Worsening of asthma or of any other breathing condition \n\n- Heartburn, difficult swallowing, pain with swallowing, stomach pain or chest pain that does \n\nnot go away or worsens \n\n \n\nCertain conditions or factors can increase the likelihood of an allergic reaction. These include: \n\n- Worsening of asthma \n\n- Having an open sore or other damage to the lining of the mouth or the passage leading from the \n\nmouth to the stomach (oesophagus) \n\n- Exercising \n\n- Having a hot bath or shower \n\n- Being very tired or missing sleep \n\n- For women, having your period  \n\n- Taking certain pain medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen \n\n- Drinking alcohol \n\n- Being stressed \n\n- Taking PALFORZIA on an empty stomach \n\n \n\nThere are actions you should take to avoid some of these factors from affecting you. These factors \n\ninclude: exercise, having a hot bath or shower, drinking alcohol, or taking this medicine on an empty \n\nstomach. See the sections on ‘PALFORZIA with food, drink and alcohol’ and ‘Dosing instructions’ \n\nfor advice on what to do about these. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\nFor all other conditions or factors listed above, contact your doctor for advice if you experience \n\nallergic reactions during any of these. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will prescribe adrenaline for you to self-inject, which you must have with you at all times \n\nin case you have a severe allergic reaction. Your doctor will tell you how to recognise an allergic \n\nreaction and teach you when and how to use the adrenaline. Talk to your doctor and read the \n\nadrenaline package leaflet if you have any questions about its use. \n\n \n\nIf you use adrenaline, do not take any further doses of PALFORZIA and seek emergency medical care \n\nimmediately afterwards. \n\n \n\nDesensitisation to peanut with PALFORZIA takes time. The ability to tolerate gradually increasing \n\nsmall amounts of peanut has been shown after completion of all up-dosing levels of PALFORZIA and \n\nafter at least 3 months of maintenance therapy and this continues to improve over time. \n\n \n\nYou must take PALFORZIA every day to maintain the desensitisation it provides. Missing any doses \n\ncan lead to an increased risk of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA treatment may not work in all patients. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is intended for children and young people aged 4 to 17 years and those who become \n\nadults whilst on treatment. \n\n \n\nDo not give this medicine to children aged less than 4 years because it is not known if PALFORZIA is \n\nsafe and effective in this age group. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and PALFORZIA \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA with food, drink and alcohol \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA should not be mixed with liquid (e.g., water, milk, juice, soup, smoothie). \n\n \n\nDo not drink alcohol 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking PALFORZIA as this may increase the \n\nlikelihood of an allergic reaction.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\n \n\nDo not start treatment with PALFORZIA if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA may have a small effect on your ability to drive, cycle or operate machinery. Exercise \n\ncaution for 2 hours after taking a dose of PALFORZIA in case you have an allergic reaction which \n\naffects your ability to drive, cycle, or use machinery. Wait until all symptoms of such allergic \n\nreactions have gone away before driving, cycling, or using machinery. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n3. How to take PALFORZIA \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is prescribed by doctors who are experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of allergy \n\nand allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. \n\n \n\nHow should I take PALFORZIA? \n\n \n\nDosing \n\n \n\nThere are 3 phases of treatment with PALFORZIA: initial dose escalation, up-dosing, and \n\nmaintenance. You must complete these treatment phases in the order that your doctor has prescribed. \n\nDuring the initial dose escalation and up-dosing phases, the dose of PALFORZIA is increased in a \n\nprecise way. During the maintenance phase, you take the same dose of PALFORZIA each day. \n\n \n\nYou should take PALFORZIA every day to maintain your level of desensitisation to peanuts. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor on the day of each clinic visit if you are feeling unwell or if you feel your asthma is \n\nless controlled. \n\n \n\nInitial dose escalation \n\n \n\nYou will be treated with the first doses (initial dose escalation) of PALFORZIA over about 4 to \n\n5 hours in your doctor’s clinic. On the first day you will be treated with 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, \n\nand 6 mg of PALFORZIA. \n\n \n\nUp-dosing \n\n \n\nIf you tolerate the initial dose-escalation phase, you will be asked to return to your doctor’s clinic on \n\nanother day (usually the next day) to start the up-dosing phase. \n\n \n\nThere are 11 different dose levels of up-dosing, starting with PALFORZIA 3 mg (level 1) and \n\nincreasing to PALFORZIA 300 mg (level 11). \n\n \n\nThe up-dosing levels are shown in the table below: \n\n \n\nDaily dose Dose level Presentation of dose \n\n3 mg level 1 3 × 1 mg capsules (red) \n\n6 mg level 2 6 × 1 mg capsules (red) \n\n12 mg level 3 2 × 1 mg capsules (red) and  \n\n1 × 10 mg capsule (blue) \n\n20 mg level 4 1 × 20 mg capsule (white) \n\n40 mg level 5 2 × 20 mg capsules (white) \n\n80 mg level 6 4 × 20 mg capsules (white) \n\n120 mg level 7 1 × 20 mg capsule (white) and  \n\n1 × 100 mg capsule (red) \n\n160 mg level 8 3 × 20 mg capsules (white) and  \n\n1 × 100 mg capsule (red) \n\n200 mg level 9 2 × 100 mg capsules (red) \n\n240 mg level 10 2 × 20 mg capsules (white) and  \n\n2 × 100 mg capsules (red) \n\n300 mg level 11 1 × 300mg sachet \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nThe first dose of each up-dosing level is given to you by your doctor in a clinic. If you tolerate the first \n\ndose of a new dose level, your doctor will ask you to continue to take that dose every day at home for \n\nabout 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nDuring the up-dosing phase, your doctor will see you about every 2 weeks to assess you for a new up-\n\ndosing level. \n\n \n\nYou must have completed all 11 up-dosing levels before you can start maintenance treatment. It will \n\ntake at least 22 weeks to complete all up-dosing levels. \n\n \n\nMaintenance dosing \n\n \n\nIf you are able tolerate level 11 of the up-dosing phase, your doctor will ask you to continue taking \n\nPALFORZIA at a 300 mg dose every day as maintenance therapy. \n\n \n\nPreparation for use \n\n \n\nPALFORZIA is available either in capsules or sachets. Empty the powder from PALFORZIA capsules \n\nor sachets.  \n\n \n\nDo not swallow PALFORZIA capsules. \n\n \n\nOpen the daily dose of PALFORZIA. \n\n- To open a capsule gently pull the two ends of the capsule apart over a bowl with soft food and \n\nempty the powder into the bowl by rolling each half of the capsule between the finger and \n\nthumb. Tap the ends of each half capsule to make sure that all the powder is emptied. \n\n- To open a sachet carefully cut or tear along the top along the line indicated. Tip the sachet \n\nupside down over a bowl with soft food and tap the sachet to make sure that all the powder is \n\nemptied. \n\n \n\nEmpty the full dose of PALFORZIA oral powder on to a small amount of soft food to which you are \n\nnot allergic such as fruit puree, yogurt, or rice-pudding. Make sure you are not allergic to the food \n\nused for mixing. \n\n \n\nThe food used for mixing should be cool and no warmer than room temperature. \n\n \n\nMix well. \n\n \n\nUse just enough food to mix with PALFORZIA so you can eat it all in a few spoonfuls to take the full \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nTake PALFORZIA immediately after mixing. However, if needed, you can mix PALFORZIA with \n\nfood and keep it in a refrigerator for up to 8 hours before taking. If it is not used within 8 hours, throw \n\nit away and prepare a new dose. \n\n \n\nHandling instructions \n\n \n\nDo not breathe in PALFORZIA powder as this could cause breathing problems (worsening of asthma) \n\nor cause an allergic reaction. \n\n \n\nWash your hands immediately after handling PALFORZIA capsules or sachets. \n\n \n\nWhen your doctor has told you that an up-dosing level is complete, you must dispose of all remaining \n\ncapsules or sachets from that pack (see section 5) before starting on a new level. This includes any \n\nextra doses that are provided in each pack, if not used. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\nDosing instructions \n\n \n\nTake PALFORZIA at about the same time every day with food, preferably as part of your evening \n\nmeal. Do not take this medicine on an empty stomach. \n\n \n\nDo not take PALFORZIA at home on the days that you visit your doctor for assessment as your doctor \n\nwill give you PALFORZIA on these days. \n\n \n\nChildren should be given each dose of PALFORZIA by an adult and they should be watched for about \n\n1 hour afterwards for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. \n\n \n\nDo not take within 2 hours of bedtime. \n\n \n\nDo not have a hot bath or shower just before or for 3 hours after taking PALFORZIA. \n\n \n\nDo not exercise just before or for 3 hours after taking PALFORZIA. \n\n \n\nIf you have been exercising or have taken a hot bath or shower and are feeling hot, or you are sweating \n\nand your heart is beating fast, do not take PALFORZIA until you have cooled down and your heart \n\nrate (pulse) has returned to normal. \n\n \n\nDo not take more than your individual total daily dose according to your current dose level of \n\nPALFORZIA in a single day. \n\n \n\nIf you take more PALFORZIA than you should \n\n \n\nTaking PALFORZIA at doses more than those recommended increases the risk of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nIn the case of severe reactions such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, changes in your \n\nvoice, or a feeling of fullness in the throat, treat the reaction with adrenaline self-injector as instructed \n\nby your doctor and then contact a doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to take PALFORZIA \n\n \n\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nMissed doses of PALFORZIA may cause you to lose the peanut tolerance you have built up and \n\nincrease your risk of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nIf you miss your dose of PALFORZIA for 1 to 2 days in a row, take the next dose at your normal \n\nscheduled time the next day. \n\n \n\nIf you miss your dose of PALFORZIA for 3 days in a row or longer, stop taking PALFORZIA and \n\ncontact your doctor for advice on how to start your treatment again. \n\n \n\nIf you stop taking PALFORZIA \n\n \n\nStopping PALFORZIA may cause you to lose the peanut tolerance you have built up and increase \n\nyour risk of allergic reactions. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.
