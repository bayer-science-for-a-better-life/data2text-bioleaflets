NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVaniqa 11.5% cream \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach gram of cream contains 115 mg of eflornithine (as hydrochloride monohydrate). \n \nExcipients with known effect: \nEach gram of cream contains 47.2 mg of cetostearyl alcohol, 14.2 mg of stearyl alcohol, 0.8 mg of \nmethyl parahydroxybenzoate and 0.32 mg of propyl parahydroxybenzoate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nCream. \n \nWhite to off white cream \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n \nTreatment of facial hirsutism in women. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \nVaniqa cream should be applied to the affected area twice daily, at least eight hours apart. Efficacy has \nonly been demonstrated for affected areas of the face and under the chin. Application should be \nlimited to these areas. Maximal applied doses used safely in clinical trials were up to 30 grams per \nmonth. \nImprovement in the condition may be noticed within eight weeks of starting treatment. \nContinued treatment may result in further improvement and is necessary to maintain beneficial effects. \nThe condition may return to pre-treatment levels within eight weeks following discontinuation of \ntreatment. \nUse should be discontinued if no beneficial effects are noticed within four months of commencing \ntherapy. \nPatients may need to continue to use a hair removal method (e.g. shaving or plucking) in conjunction \nwith Vaniqa. In that case, the cream should be applied no sooner than five minutes after shaving or use \nof other hair removal methods, as increased stinging or burning may otherwise occur. \n \nSpecial population \nElderly: (> 65 years) no dosage adjustment is necessary. \n \nPaediatric population:  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Vaniqa in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. There is no \ndata available to support use in this age group. \n\n \nHepatic/renal impairment: the safety and efficacy of Vaniqa in women with hepatic or renal \nimpairment have not been established. As the safety of Vaniqa has not been studied in patients with \n\n\n\n3 \n\nsevere renal impairment, caution should be used when prescribing Vaniqa for these patients. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \nA thin layer of the cream should be applied to clean and dry affected areas. The cream should be \nrubbed in thoroughly. The medicinal product should be applied such that no visual residual product \nremains on the treated areas after rub-in. Hands should be washed after applying this medicinal \nproduct. For maximal efficacy, the treated area should not be cleansed within four hours of \napplication. Cosmetics (including sunscreens) can be applied over the treated areas, but no sooner than \nfive minutes after application. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nExcessive hair growth can result from serious underlying disorders (e.g. polycystic ovary syndrome, \nandrogen secreting neoplasm) or certain active substances (e.g. cyclosporin, glucocorticoids, \nminoxidil, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, combined oestrogen-androgen hormone replacement therapy). \nThese factors should be considered in the overall medical treatment of patients who might be \nprescribed Vaniqa. \nVaniqa is for cutaneous use only. Contact with eyes or mucous membranes (e.g. nose or mouth) \nshould be avoided. Transient stinging or burning may occur when the cream is applied to abraded or \nbroken skin. \nIf skin irritation or intolerance develops, the frequency of application should be reduced temporarily to \nonce a day. If irritation continues, treatment should be discontinued and the physician consulted. \nThis medicinal product contains cetostearyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol which may cause local skin \nreactions (e.g. contact dermatitis) as well as methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl \nparahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThroughout clinical trials data from a limited number of exposed pregnancies (22) indicate that there is \nno clinical evidence that treatment with Vaniqa adversely affects mothers or foetuses. Among the \n22 pregnancies that occurred during the trials, only 19 pregnancies occurred while the patient was \nusing Vaniqa. Of these 19 pregnancies, there were 9 healthy infants, 5 elective abortions, \n4 spontaneous abortions and 1 birth defect (Down\u2019s Syndrome to a 35 year old). To date, no other \nrelevant epidemiological data are available. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. Therefore, women who are pregnant or \nplanning pregnancy should use an alternative means to manage facial hair. \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether eflornithine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Women should not use \nVaniqa whilst breastfeeding. \nFertility \nThere are no data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVaniqa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nThe mostly skin related adverse reactions reported were primarily mild in intensity and resolved \nwithout discontinuation of Vaniqa or initiation of medical treatment. The most frequently reported \nadverse reaction was acne, which was generally mild. In the vehicle controlled trials (n= 596), acne \nwas observed in 41% of patients at baseline; 7% of patients treated with Vaniqa and 8% treated with \nvehicle experienced a worsening of their condition. Of those with no acne at baseline, similar \npercentages (14%) reported acne following treatment with Vaniqa or vehicle. \nThe following listing notes the frequency of adverse skin reactions seen in clinical trials, according to \nMedDRA convention. MedDRA conventions for frequency are very common (\u22651/10), common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) including isolated reports. \nNote that over 1350 patients were treated with Vaniqa in these trials for 6 months to one year, while \nonly slightly more than 200 patients were treated with vehicle for 6 months. Most events were \nreported at similar rates between Vaniqa and vehicle. The skin effects of burning, stinging, tingling, \nrash and erythema were reported at higher levels in Vaniqa treated patients compared to vehicle, as \nindicated by the asterisk (*). \n \nFrequency of adverse skin reactions seen in Vaniqa clinical trials, (according to MedDRA frequency \nconvention). \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nVery common \n(\u22651/10) \n \n\nAcne \n\nCommon \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10) \n \n\nPseudofolliculitis barbae, alopecia, stinging skin*, burning skin*, dry skin, \npruritus, erythema*, tingling skin*, irritated skin, rash*, folliculitis \n\nUncommon \n(\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \n \n \n\nIngrown hair, oedema face, dermatitis, oedema mouth, papular rash, bleeding \nskin, herpes simplex, eczema, cheilitis, furunculosis, contact dermatitis,  \nabnormal hair texture and abnormal hair growth, hypopigmentation, flushing \nskin, lip numbness, skin soreness \n\nRare \n(\u22651/10,000 to \n<1/1,000) \n\nRosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, skin neoplasm, maculopapular rash, skin \ncysts, vesiculobullous rash, skin disorder, hirsutism, skin tightness \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe adverse reactions observed in adolescents are similar to the ones observed in adults. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nGiven the minimal cutaneous penetration of eflornithine (see section 5.2), overdose is highly unlikely. \nHowever, should very high dose cutaneous administration or accidental oral ingestion occur, attention \nshould be paid to the effects seen with therapeutic doses of intravenous eflornithine (400 mg/kg/day or \napproximately 24 g/day) used in the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection (African \nsleeping sickness): hair loss, facial swelling, seizures, hearing impairment, gastrointestinal \ndisturbance, loss of appetite, headache, weakness, dizziness, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and \nleucopenia. \nIf symptoms of overdose occur the use of the medicinal product should be stopped. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other dermatological preparations, ATC code: D11AX16. \n \nMechanism of action \nEflornithine irreversibly inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in the production of the \nhair shaft by the hair follicle. Vaniqa has been shown to reduce the rate of hair growth. \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and efficacy of Vaniqa was evaluated in two double-blind, randomised, vehicle-controlled \nclinical trials involving 596 women of skin types I-VI (395 on Vaniqa, 201 on vehicle) treated for up \nto 24 weeks. Physicians assessed the change from baseline on a 4-point scale, 48 hours after women \nhad shaved the treated areas of the affected areas of the face and under the chin, considering \nparameters such as hair length and density, and darkening of the skin associated with the presence of \nterminal hair. Improvement was seen as early as 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. \n \nThe combined results of these two trials are presented below: \n \n\nOutcome* Vaniqa 11.5% cream Vehicle \nClear / almost clear \nMarked improvement \nImproved \nNo improvement / worse \n\n6% \n29% \n35% \n30% \n\n0% \n9% \n33% \n58% \n\n* At end of therapy (Week 24). For patients who discontinued therapy during the \ntrial last observations were carried forward to Week 24. \n\n \nStatistically significant (p \u2264 0.001) improvement for Vaniqa versus vehicle was seen in each of these \nstudies for women with marked improvement and clear/almost clear responses. These improvements \nresulted in a corresponding reduction in the darkening appearance of the facial skin associated with the \npresence of terminal hair. Subgroup analysis revealed a difference in treatment success where 27% of \nnon-white women and 39% of white women showed a marked or better improvement. Subgroup \nanalysis also showed that 29% of obese women (BMI \u2265 30) and 43% of normal weight women \n(BMI < 30) showed a marked or better improvement. About 12% of women in the clinical trials were \npostmenopausal. Significant improvement (p < 0.001) versus vehicle was seen in postmenopausal \nwomen. \nPatient self-assessments demonstrated a significantly reduced psychological discomfort with the \ncondition, as measured by responses to 6 questions on a visual analogue scale. Vaniqa significantly \nreduced how bothered patients felt by their facial hair and by the time spent removing, treating, or \nconcealing facial hair. Patient comfort in various social and work settings was also improved. Patient \nself-assessments were found to correlate with physician observations of efficacy. These patient-\nobservable differences were seen 8 weeks after initiating treatment. \nThe condition returned to pre-treatment levels within eight weeks after discontinuation of treatment. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nSteady state cutaneous penetration of eflornithine in women from Vaniqa on facial skin of shaving \nwomen was 0.8%. \nThe steady state plasma half-life of eflornithine was approximately 8 hours. Steady state was reached \nwithin four days. The steady state peak and trough plasma concentrations of eflornithine were \napproximately 10 ng/ml and 5 ng/ml, respectively. The steady state 12-hour area under the plasma \nconcentration versus time curve was 92.5 ng.hr/ml. \nEflornithine is not known to be metabolised and is eliminated primarily in the urine. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose \ntoxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, including one photocarcinogenicity study in mice. \nIn a dermal fertility study in rats, no adverse effects on fertility were observed at up to 180 times the \nhuman dose. In dermal teratology studies, no teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits at \ndoses up to 180 and 36 times the human dose, respectively. Higher doses resulted in maternal and \nfoetal toxicity without evidence of teratogenicity. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their symptoms are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Vaniqa is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Vaniqa \n3. How to use Vaniqa  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vaniqa \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vaniqa is and what it is used for \nVaniqa contains the active substance eflornithine. Eflornithine slows down the growth of hair through \nits effect on a specific enzyme (a protein in the body involved in the production of hair). \n \nVaniqa is used to reduce the growth of excessive hair (Hirsutism) on the face of women older than \n18 years of age. \n\n \n 2. What you need to know before you use Vaniqa \n \nDo not use Vaniqa: \n \n\n\u2022 if you are allergic to eflornithine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in \nsection 6.  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor of pharmacist before using Vaniqa \n \n\n\u2022 tell your doctor of any other medical problems you may be experiencing (especially related to \nyour kidneys or liver).  \n\n\u2022 if you are unsure whether or not to use this medicine contact your doctor or pharmacist for \nadvice. \n\n \nExcessive growth of hair may be a result of underlying diseases. Talk to your doctor if you suffer from \npolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or specific hormone producing tumours, or if you take medicines \nthat can induce hair growth, e.g. cyclosporine (following organ transplants), glucocorticoids (e.g. \nagainst rheumatic or allergic diseases), minoxidil (against high blood pressure), phenobarbitone \n(against seizures), phenytoin (against seizures) or hormone replacement therapy with male hormone \nlike effects. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nVaniqa is not recommended for use in anyone younger than 18 years of age. \n\n \nOther medicines and Vaniqa \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you need to use other medicines on the areas of skin where you are using the \ncream. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nDo not use Vaniqa if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. You should use an alternative method to \nmanage your facial hair if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nVaniqa is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. \n \n \nVaniqa contains cetostearyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. \ncontact dermatitis). Vaniqa also contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) and propyl \nparahydroxybenzoate (E216) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \n \n \n3. How to use Vaniqa \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n\n\u2022 Use twice a day, at least 8 hours apart. \n\u2022 If you experience irritation (e.g. stinging burning), reduce the use of Vaniqa to once \n\ndaily until the irritation has gone. If it persists contact your doctor. \n\u2022 If you have just shaved or used any other hair removal method, wait at least 5 minutes \n\nbefore using Vaniqa. It may sting or burn if you put this cream on cut or irritated skin. \n\u2022 Clean and dry the areas of the skin where you will be using the cream. \n\u2022 Apply a thin layer of cream and rub it in thoroughly until no visual residual product \n\nremains on the treated areas. \n\u2022 If possible, do not wash these areas of skin for 4 hours after applying the cream \n\u2022 Wash your hands after applying the cream. \n\u2022 Wait at least 5 minutes before using make-up or sunscreen on the same areas. \n\u2022 When using on the face, avoid contact with your eyes or the inside of your nose or \n\nmouth. If you should accidentally get Vaniqa into your eyes, mouth or nose, rinse well \nwith water. \n\n \nVaniqa is not a depilatory cream, so you may need to continue with your hair removal method, for \nexample by shaving or plucking. \n \nIt may take 8 weeks before you see results. It is important to continue using the cream. If you do not \nsee any improvement after using it for 4 months contact your doctor. If you stop using it your original \nhair growth may return within 8 weeks. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nIf you use more Vaniqa than you should \n \nIf you put too much cream on your skin, it is unlikely to harm you. \n \nIf you or anyone else accidentally swallows Vaniqa, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Vaniqa \n \nApply straight away, but wait at least 8 hours before using it again. \n \nIf you stop using Vaniqa \n \nTo maintain the reduction of hair growth keep using Vaniqa continuously as indicated. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects are usually limited to the skin and mild in intensity. In such cases they normally resolve \nwithout discontinuation of Vaniqa. \n \nThe frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: \n \nvery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \ncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \nuncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \nrare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \nvery rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000) \nnot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nVery common (affects more than 1 user in 10) \no acne \n\n \nCommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) \no dry skin \no hair loss \no inflammation around the hair shaft \no itching \no rash \no redness \no skin irritation and bumps caused by shaving \no skin irritation \no stinging, tingling or burning feeling on the skin \n \nUncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) \no bumpy rash (papular rash) \no cold sores \no redness and irritation at the site where the cream is applied \no eczema \no inflammed, dry, cracked or numb lips \no ingrowing hairs \no pale areas on the skin \n\n\n\n19 \n\no skin bleeding \no skin boils \no skin flushing  \no skin inflammation \no sore skin \no swelling of the mouth or face \no unusual hair texture or hair growth \n \nRare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) \no abnormal skin growth (skin neoplasm) \no excessive hair growth  \no flushing, facial redness and pimples possibly with pus \no other skin disorders \no red, scaly and itchy skin inflammation (seborrhoeic dermatitis) \no red, bumpy or blistering rash \no skin cysts \no skin tightness \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

burn if you put this cream on cut or irritated skin. clean and dry the areas of the skin where you will be using the cream. apply a thin layer of cream and rub it in thoroughly until no visual residual product remains on the treated areas. if possible, do not wash these areas of skin for 4 hours after applying the cream wash your hands after applying the cream. wait at least 5 minutes before using make-up or sunscreen on the same areas. when using on the face, avoid contact with your eyes or the inside of your nose or mouth. if you should accidentally get vaniqa into your eyes, mouth or nose, rinse well with water. vaniqa is not a depilatory cream, so you may need to continue with your hair removal method, for example by shaving or plucking. it may take 8 weeks before you see results. it is important to continue using the cream. if you do not see any improvement after using it for 4 months contact your doctor. if you stop using it your original hair growth may return within 8 weeks. if you use more vaniqa than you should if you put too much cream on your skin, it is unlikely to harm you. if you or anyone else accidentally swallows vaniqa, contact your doctor immediately. if you forget to use vaniqa apply straight away, but wait at least 8 hours before using it again. if you stop using vaniqa to maintain the reduction of hair growth keep using vaniqa
