NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nExcipient: \nEach tablet contains 26.65 mg of lactose (as lactose monohydrate). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nPeach, biconvex, oval-shaped, with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2775 engraved on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is \nnot recommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\nHepatic impairment: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not indicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. \nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly patients: no dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n \nPaediatric patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \n\nsulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 4\n\n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, minimal or no effects \nwere reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment \nand/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk \nis recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts \nsubstitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS (see \nsection 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or ischemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 5\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is administered with medicinal \nproducts affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 6\n\nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 7\n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. They may cause a decrease in placental \nperfusion, foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults. \nCases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, or foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal \nthiazide therapy. Since Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not \nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment \nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS during \nbreast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments \nwith better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a \nnewborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect this ability. \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials in which 898 hypertensive patients received various doses (range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to \n300 mg/25 mg irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports* \n\nCommon: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \ncreatinine and creatine kinase \n\nInvestigations: \n\nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and \nsodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, \noedema \n\nCommon: dizziness Nervous system disorders: \nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 8\n\nNot known: headache \nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \nCommon: abnormal urination Renal and urinary disorders: \nNot known: impaired renal function including \n\nisolated cases of renal failure in patients \nat risk (see section 4.4) \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity Musculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: Not known: arthralgia, myalgia \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such \nas angioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n* Frequency for adverse reactions detected by spontaneous reports is described as “not known” \n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to medicinal product) reported with the \nuse of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including \n\nhypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, see \nsection 4.4), hyperuricaemia, glycosuria, \nhyperglycaemia, increases in cholesterol \nand triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow \ndepression, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, \nhaemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, \nthrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including \npneumonitis and pulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, gastric irritation, \nsialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 9\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation \nof cutaneous lupus erythematosus, \nphotosensitivity reactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic \njaundice) \n\nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 10\n\naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff \nduring office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg and \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. These 24-hour effects were \nobserved without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are consistent with safe and effective \nblood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 11\n\nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS as initial therapy for severe hypertension \n(defined as SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-\ncontrolled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, the absolute oral \nbioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does \nnot affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Peak plasma concentration \noccurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the \nterminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \nThe mean plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 12\n\nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. Irbesartan and its \nmetabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or intravenous \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 61% of the \noral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not \nthe blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. In patients with creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of \nhydrochlorothiazide was reported to increase to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide: the potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination after oral administration was evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to \n6 months. There were no toxicological findings observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 13\n\nIrbesartan: there was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant \ndoses. In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \n≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, \nhaemoglobin, haematocrit). At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys \n(such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of \nurea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered \nsecondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. \nFurthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \n≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused \nby the pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in \nsome experimental models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to \nshow an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nTablet. \nPeach, biconvex, oval-shaped, with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2776 engraved on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is \nnot recommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 16\n\nHepatic impairment: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not indicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. \nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly patients: no dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n \nPaediatric patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \n\nsulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 17\n\n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, minimal or no effects \nwere reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment \nand/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk \nis recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts \nsubstitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS (see \nsection 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or ischemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 18\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is administered with medicinal \nproducts affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 19\n\nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 20\n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. They may cause a decrease in placental \nperfusion, foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults. \nCases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, or foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal \nthiazide therapy. Since Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not \nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment \nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS during \nbreast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments \nwith better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a \nnewborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect this ability. \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials in which 898 hypertensive patients received various doses (range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to \n300 mg/25 mg irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports* \n\nCommon: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \ncreatinine and creatine kinase \n\nInvestigations: \n\nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and \nsodium \n\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, \noedema \n\nCommon: dizziness Nervous system disorders: \nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 21\n\nNot known: headache \nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \nCommon: abnormal urination Renal and urinary disorders: \nNot known: impaired renal function including \n\nisolated cases of renal failure in patients \nat risk (see section 4.4) \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity Musculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: Not known: arthralgia, myalgia \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such \nas angioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n* Frequency for adverse reactions detected by spontaneous reports is described as “not known” \n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to medicinal product) reported with the \nuse of hydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including \n\nhypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, see \nsection 4.4), hyperuricaemia, glycosuria, \nhyperglycaemia, increases in cholesterol \nand triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow \ndepression, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, \nhaemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, \nthrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including \npneumonitis and pulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, \nconstipation, gastric irritation, \nsialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 22\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation \nof cutaneous lupus erythematosus, \nphotosensitivity reactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic \njaundice) \n\nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 23\n\naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff \nduring office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg and \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. These 24-hour effects were \nobserved without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are consistent with safe and effective \nblood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 24\n\nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS as initial therapy for severe hypertension \n(defined as SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-\ncontrolled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, the absolute oral \nbioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does \nnot affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Peak plasma concentration \noccurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the \nterminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \nThe mean plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 25\n\nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. Irbesartan and its \nmetabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or intravenous \nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 61% of the \noral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not \nthe blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. In patients with creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of \nhydrochlorothiazide was reported to increase to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide: the potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination after oral administration was evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to \n6 months. There were no toxicological findings observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 26\n\nIrbesartan: there was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant \ndoses. In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \n≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, \nhaemoglobin, haematocrit). At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys \n(such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of \nurea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered \nsecondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. \nFurthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \n≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused \nby the pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in \nsome experimental models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to \nshow an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nExcipient: \nEach film-coated tablet contains 38.5 mg of lactose (as lactose monohydrate). \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nPeach, biconvex, oval-shaped, with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2875 engraved on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is \nnot recommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 29\n\nHepatic impairment: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not indicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. \nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly patients: no dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n \nPaediatric patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \n\nsulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 30\n\n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, minimal or no effects \nwere reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment \nand/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk \nis recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts \nsubstitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS (see \nsection 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or ischemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 31\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is administered with medicinal \nproducts affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 32\n\nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 33\n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. They may cause a decrease in placental \nperfusion, foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults. \nCases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, or foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal \nthiazide therapy. Since Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not \nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment \nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS during \nbreast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments \nwith better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a \nnewborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect this ability. \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials in which 898 hypertensive patients received various doses (range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to \n300 mg/25 mg irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports* \n\nCommon: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \ncreatinine and creatine kinase \n\nInvestigations: \n\nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \n\nCommon: dizziness \nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \n\nNervous system disorders: \n\nNot known: headache \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 34\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \nCommon: abnormal urination Renal and urinary disorders: \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity Musculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: Not known: arthralgia, myalgia \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n* Frequency for adverse reactions detected by spontaneous reports is described as “not known” \n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS.

The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 36\n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff \nduring office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg and \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. These 24-hour effects were \nobserved without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are consistent with safe and effective \nblood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS as initial therapy for severe hypertension \n(defined as SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 37\n\ncontrolled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, the absolute oral \nbioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does \nnot affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Peak plasma concentration \noccurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the \nterminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \nThe mean plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. Irbesartan and its \nmetabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or intravenous \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 38\n\nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 61% of the \noral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not \nthe blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. In patients with creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of \nhydrochlorothiazide was reported to increase to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide: the potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination after oral administration was evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to \n6 months. There were no toxicological findings observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan: there was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant \ndoses. In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \n≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, \nhaemoglobin, haematocrit). At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys \n(such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of \nurea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered \nsecondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 39\n\nFurthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \n≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused \nby the pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in \nsome experimental models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to \nshow an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \nPeach, biconvex, oval-shaped, with a heart debossed on one side and the number 2876 engraved on the \nother side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is \nnot recommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 42\n\nHepatic impairment: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not indicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. \nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly patients: no dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n \nPaediatric patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \n\nsulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 43\n\n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, minimal or no effects \nwere reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment \nand/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk \nis recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts \nsubstitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS (see \nsection 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or ischemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 44\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is administered with medicinal \nproducts affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 45\n\nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 46\n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. They may cause a decrease in placental \nperfusion, foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults. \nCases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, or foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal \nthiazide therapy. Since Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not \nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment \nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS during \nbreast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments \nwith better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a \nnewborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect this ability. \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials in which 898 hypertensive patients received various doses (range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to \n300 mg/25 mg irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports* \n\nCommon: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \ncreatinine and creatine kinase \n\nInvestigations: \n\nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \n\nCommon: dizziness \nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \n\nNervous system disorders: \n\nNot known: headache \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 47\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \nCommon: abnormal urination Renal and urinary disorders: \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity Musculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: Not known: arthralgia, myalgia \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n* Frequency for adverse reactions detected by spontaneous reports is described as “not known” \n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to medicinal product) reported with the use of \nhydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 48\n\ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 49\n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff \nduring office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg and \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. These 24-hour effects were \nobserved without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are consistent with safe and effective \nblood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS as initial therapy for severe hypertension \n(defined as SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 50\n\ncontrolled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, the absolute oral \nbioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does \nnot affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Peak plasma concentration \noccurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the \nterminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \nThe mean plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. Irbesartan and its \nmetabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or intravenous \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 51\n\nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 61% of the \noral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not \nthe blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. In patients with creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of \nhydrochlorothiazide was reported to increase to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide: the potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination after oral administration was evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to \n6 months. There were no toxicological findings observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan: there was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant \ndoses. In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \n≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, \nhaemoglobin, haematocrit). At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys \n(such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of \nurea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered \nsecondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 52\n\nFurthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \n≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused \nby the pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in \nsome experimental models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to \nshow an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of essential hypertension. \nThis fixed dose combination is indicated in adult patients whose blood pressure is not adequately \ncontrolled on irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken once daily, with or without food.  \nDose titration with the individual components (i.e. irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide) may be \nrecommended. \n \nWhen clinically appropriate direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combinations may be \nconsidered: \n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose \n\nblood pressure is not adequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide or irbesartan 150 mg \nalone; \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by irbesartan 300 mg or by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS 150 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/25 mg may be administered in patients \ninsufficiently controlled by Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg. \n\n \nDoses higher than 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily are not recommended. \nWhen necessary, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS may be administered with another \nantihypertensive medicinal product (see section 4.5). \n \nRenal impairment: due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is \nnot recommended for patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). Loop \ndiuretics are preferred to thiazides in this population. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients \nwith renal impairment whose renal creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 55\n\nHepatic impairment: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not indicated in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. \nNo dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). \n \nElderly patients: no dosage adjustment of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is necessary in elderly \npatients. \n \nPaediatric patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for use in children and \nadolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (see section 6.1), or to other \n\nsulfonamide-derived substances (hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide-derived substance) \n Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \n Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) \n Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia \n Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis and cholestasis \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypotension - Volume-depleted patients: Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS has been rarely \nassociated with symptomatic hypotension in hypertensive patients without other risk factors for \nhypotension. Symptomatic hypotension may be expected to occur in patients who are volume and/or \nsodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such \nconditions should be corrected before initiating therapy with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nRenal artery stenosis - Renovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and \nrenal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single \nfunctioning kidney are treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II \nreceptor antagonists. While this is not documented with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, a \nsimilar effect should be anticipated. \n \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used in \npatients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid \nserum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min) (see section 4.3). Thiazide diuretic-associated azotemia may occur in patients \nwith impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment \nwhose creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min but < 60 ml/min) this fixed dose combination should be \nadministered with caution. \n \nHepatic impairment: thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function \nor progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate \nhepatic coma. There is no clinical experience with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS in patients \nwith hepatic impairment. \n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 56\n\n \nMetabolic and endocrine effects: thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. In diabetic patients \ndosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Latent diabetes mellitus \nmay become manifest during thiazide therapy. \nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; \nhowever at the 12.5 mg dose contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, minimal or no effects \nwere reported. \nHyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide \ntherapy. \n \nElectrolyte imbalance: as for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum \nelectrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals. \nThiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis). Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are \ndryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, \nmuscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea \nor vomiting. \nAlthough hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with \nirbesartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is greatest in patients \nwith cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving \ninadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with \ncorticosteroids or ACTH. Conversely, due to the irbesartan component of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS hyperkalaemia might occur, especially in the presence of renal impairment \nand/or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk \nis recommended. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salts \nsubstitutes should be co-administered cautiously with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS (see \nsection 4.5). \nThere is no evidence that irbesartan would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia. Chloride \ndeficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment. \nThiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of \nserum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcaemia \nmay be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out \ntests for parathyroid function. \nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in \nhypomagnaesemia. \n \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended \n(see section 4.5). \n \nAnti-doping test: hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicinal product could produce a positive \nanalytic result in an anti-doping test. \n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive \nagent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischemic cardiopathy or ischemic \ncardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nHypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of \nallergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. \nExacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide \ndiuretics. \nCases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides diuretics (see section 4.8). If \nphotosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a re-\nadministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the \nsun or to artificial UVA. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 57\n\n \nPregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \n \nLactose: this medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nOther antihypertensive agents: the antihypertensive effect of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents. Irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide (at doses up to 300 mg irbesartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) have been safely \nadministered with other antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and \nbeta-adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and \na risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with irbesartan with or without thiazide diuretics unless \nthe volume depletion is corrected first (see section 4.4). \n \nLithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is \nreduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Therefore, the combination of lithium and Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of \nserum lithium levels is recommended. \n \nMedicinal products affecting potassium: the potassium-depleting effect of hydrochlorothiazide is \nattenuated by the potassium-sparing effect of irbesartan. However, this effect of hydrochlorothiazide \non serum potassium would be expected to be potentiated by other medicinal products associated with \npotassium loss and hypokalaemia (e.g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, amphotericin, \ncarbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum \npotassium. Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nMedicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances: periodic monitoring of serum \npotassium is recommended when Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is administered with medicinal \nproducts affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics). \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \n \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 58\n\nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of \nirbesartan. \n \nAdditional information on hydrochlorothiazide interactions: when administered concurrently, the \nfollowing medicinal products may interact with thiazide diuretics: \n \nAlcohol: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur; \n \nAntidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulins): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic \nmedicinal product may be required (see section 4.4); \n \nColestyramine and Colestipol resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of \nanionic exchange resins; \n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; \n \nDigitalis glycosides: thiazide induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnaesemia favour the onset of \ndigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias (see section 4.4); \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \nmay reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics in some patients; \n \nPressor amines (e.g. noradrenaline): the effect of pressor amines may be decreased, but not \nsufficiently to preclude their use; \n \nNondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine): the effect of nondepolarizing skeletal \nmuscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide; \n \nAntigout medicinal products: dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as \nhydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of probenecid or \nsulfinpyrazone may be necessary. Co-administration of thiazide diuretics may increase the incidence \nof hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol; \n \nCalcium salts: thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion. If \ncalcium supplements or calcium sparing medicinal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be \nprescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly; \n \nOther interactions: the hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by \nthiazides. Anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, beperiden) may increase the bioavailability of \nthiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides \nmay increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine. Thiazides may reduce the renal \nexcretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their \nmyelosuppressive effects. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: \n \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 59\n\ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \n \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nThiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. They may cause a decrease in placental \nperfusion, foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults. \nCases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, or foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal \nthiazide therapy. Since Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains hydrochlorothiazide, it is not \nrecommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment \nshould be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. \n \nLactation: \n \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS during \nbreast-feeding, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended and alternative treatments \nwith better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a \nnewborn or preterm infant. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its \npharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect this ability. \nWhen driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that occasionally \ndizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of hypertension. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: \nTable 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled \ntrials in which 898 hypertensive patients received various doses (range: 37.5 mg/6.25 mg to \n300 mg/25 mg irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide). \n \nThe frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: \nvery common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare \n(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects \nare presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials and Spontaneous Reports* \n\nCommon: increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), \ncreatinine and creatine kinase \n\nInvestigations: \n\nUncommon: decreases in serum potassium and sodium \nCardiac disorders: Uncommon: syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, oedema \n\nCommon: dizziness \nUncommon: orthostatic dizziness \n\nNervous system disorders: \n\nNot known: headache \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 60\n\nEar and labyrinth disorders: Not known: tinnitus \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: cough \n\nCommon: nausea/vomiting \nUncommon: diarrhoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: \n\nNot known: dyspepsia, dysgeusia \nCommon: abnormal urination Renal and urinary disorders: \nNot known: impaired renal function including isolated cases \n\nof renal failure in patients at risk (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nUncommon: swelling extremity Musculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: Not known: arthralgia, myalgia \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: hyperkalaemia \n\nVascular disorders: Uncommon: flushing \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nCommon: fatigue \n\nImmune system disorders: Not known: cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as \nangioedema, rash, urticaria \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: hepatitis, abnormal liver function \nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders: \n\nUncommon: sexual dysfunction, libido changes \n\n* Frequency for adverse reactions detected by spontaneous reports is described as “not known” \n \nAdditional information on individual components: in addition to the adverse reactions listed above for \nthe combination product, other adverse reactions previously reported with one of the individual \ncomponents may be potential adverse reactions with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Tables 2 \nand 3 below detail the adverse reactions reported with the individual components of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nUncommon: chest pain \n\n \nTable 3: Adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to medicinal product) reported with the use of \nhydrochlorothiazide alone \nInvestigations: Not known: electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia \n\nand hyponatraemia, see section 4.4), \nhyperuricaemia, glycosuria, hyperglycaemia, \nincreases in cholesterol and triglycerides \n\nCardiac disorders: Not known: cardiac arrhythmias \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: aplastic anaemia, bone marrow depression, \nneutropenia/agranulocytosis, haemolytic \nanaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia \n\nNervous system disorders: Not known: vertigo, paraesthesia, light-headedness, \nrestlessness \n\nEye disorders: Not known: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders: \n\nNot known: respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and \npulmonary oedema) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Not known: pancreatitis, anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation, \ngastric irritation, sialadenitis, loss of appetite \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: Not known: interstitial nephritis, renal dysfunction \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders: \n\nNot known: anaphylactic reactions, toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis, necrotizing angitis (vasculitis, \ncutaneous vasculitis), cutaneous lupus \nerythematosus-like reactions, reactivation of \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 61\n\ncutaneous lupus erythematosus, photosensitivity \nreactions, rash, urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders: \n\nNot known: weakness, muscle spasm \n\nVascular disorders: Not known: postural hypotension \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions: \n\nNot known: fever \n\nHepatobiliary disorders: Not known: jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice) \nPsychiatric disorders: Not known: depression, sleep disturbances \n \nThe dose dependent adverse events of hydrochlorothiazide (particularly electrolyte disturbances) may \nincrease when titrating the hydrochlorothiazide. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide \nBMS. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and \nsupportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms. \nSuggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be \nuseful in the treatment of overdose. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently. \nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume \nreplacements given quickly. \n \nThe most likely manifestations of irbesartan overdose are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; \nbradycardia might also occur. \n \nOverdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, \nhypochloremia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. The most common \nsigns and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence. Hypokalaemia may result in muscle \nspasms and/or accentuate cardiac arrhythmias associated with the concomitant use of digitalis \nglycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products. \n \nIrbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by \nhaemodialysis has not been established. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin-II antagonists, combinations \nATC code: C09DA04. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, \nirbesartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide. The combination of these ingredients has an \nadditive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component \nalone. \n \nIrbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II receptor (AT1 subtype) antagonist. It is \nexpected to block all actions of angiotensin-II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source \nor route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors \nresults in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma \naldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at \nthe recommended doses in patients without risk of electrolyte imbalance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \nIrbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also \ndegrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its \nactivity. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 62\n\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of antihypertensive effect of thiazide \ndiuretics is not fully known. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, \ndirectly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. The \ndiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, \nincreases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, \nand decreases in serum potassium. Presumably through blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem, co-administration of irbesartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these \ndiuretics. With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at \nabout 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours. \n \nThe combination of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan produces dose-related additive reductions in \nblood pressure across their therapeutic dose ranges. The addition of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide to \n300 mg irbesartan once daily in patients not adequately controlled on 300 mg irbesartan alone resulted \nin further placebo-corrected diastolic blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of \n6.1 mm Hg. The combination of 300 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide resulted in an \noverall placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of up to 13.6/11.5 mm Hg. \n \nLimited clinical data (7 out of 22 patients) suggest that patients not controlled with the \n300 mg/12.5 mg combination may respond when uptitrated to 300 mg/25 mg. In these patients, an \nincremental blood pressure lowering effect was observed for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP) (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). \n \nOnce daily dosing with 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide gave systolic/diastolic \nmean placebo-adjusted blood pressure reductions at trough (24 hours post-dosing) of 12.9/6.9 mm Hg \nin patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Peak effects occurred at 3-6 hours. When assessed by \nambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the combination 150 mg irbesartan and 12.5 mg \nhydrochlorothiazide once daily produced consistent reduction in blood pressure over the 24 hours \nperiod with mean 24-hour placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic reductions of 15.8/10.0 mm Hg. When \nmeasured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the trough to peak effects of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg were 100%. The trough to peak effects measured by cuff \nduring office visits were 68% and 76% for Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 150 mg/12.5 mg and \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS 300 mg/12.5 mg, respectively. These 24-hour effects were \nobserved without excessive blood pressure lowering at peak and are consistent with safe and effective \nblood-pressure lowering over the once-daily dosing interval. \n \nIn patients not adequately controlled on 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide alone, the addition of irbesartan \ngave an added placebo-subtracted systolic/diastolic mean reduction of 11.1/7.2 mm Hg. \n \nThe blood pressure lowering effect of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is apparent \nafter the first dose and substantially present within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by \n6-8 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies, the effect of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide was maintained \nfor over one year. Although not specifically studied with the Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, \nrebound hypertension has not been seen with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThe effect of the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide on morbidity and mortality has \nnot been studied. Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with \nhydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. \n \nThere is no difference in response to Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, regardless of age or \ngender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, black \nhypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is \nadministered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e.g. 12.5 mg daily), the \nantihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of non-black patients. \n \nEfficacy and safety of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS as initial therapy for severe hypertension \n(defined as SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 63\n\ncontrolled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-\ntitrated (before assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week to \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. \n \nThe study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years, 13% were ≥ 65 years of age, \nand just 2% were ≥ 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients were diabetic, 34% were \nhyperlipidemic and the most frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina pectoris in 3.5% of \nthe participants. \n \nThe primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients whose SeDBP was \ncontrolled (SeDBP < 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent (47.2%) of patients on \nthe combination achieved trough SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on irbesartan \n(p = 0.0005). The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment \ngroup and decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at five weeks were 30.8/24.0 mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively (p < 0.0001). \n \nThe types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with the combination were \nsimilar to the adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During the 8-week treatment period, \nthere were no reported cases of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 0% of patients \nwith hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the \ncombination and monotherapy groups, respectively. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nConcomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan has no effect on the \npharmacokinetics of either medicinal product. \n \nIrbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are orally active agents and do not require biotransformation for \ntheir activity. Following oral administration of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, the absolute oral \nbioavailability is 60-80% and 50-80% for irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Food does \nnot affect the bioavailability of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS. Peak plasma concentration \noccurs at 1.5-2 hours after oral administration for irbesartan and 1-2.5 hours for hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nPlasma protein binding of irbesartan is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood \ncomponents. The volume of distribution for irbesartan is 53-93 litres. Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% \nprotein-bound in the plasma, and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83-1.14 l/kg. \n \nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. \nA less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg was observed; the \nmechanism for this is unknown. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3.0-3.5 ml/min, \nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hours. Steady-state plasma \nconcentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited \naccumulation of irbesartan (< 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, \nsomewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. \nHowever, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage \nadjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat \ngreater in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However the \nterminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. \nThe mean plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide reportedly ranges from 5-15 hours. \n \nFollowing oral or intravenous administration of 14C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma \nradioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via \nglucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide \n(approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the \ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect. Irbesartan and its \nmetabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or intravenous \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 64\n\nadministration of 14C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the \nremainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidneys. At least 61% of the \noral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not \nthe blood-brain barrier, and is excreted in breast milk. \n \nRenal impairment: in patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the \npharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by \nhaemodialysis. In patients with creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min, the elimination half-life of \nhydrochlorothiazide was reported to increase to 21 hours. \n \nHepatic impairment: in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nirbesartan are not significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIrbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide: the potential toxicity of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination after oral administration was evaluated in rats and macaques in studies lasting up to \n6 months. There were no toxicological findings observed of relevance to human therapeutic use. \nThe following changes, observed in rats and macaques receiving the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination at 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day, were also seen with one of the two medicinal products \nalone and/or were secondary to decreases in blood pressure (no significant toxicologic interactions \nwere observed): \n kidney changes, characterized by slight increases in serum urea and creatinine, and \n\nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which are a direct consequence of the \ninteraction of irbesartan with the renin-angiotensin system; \n\n slight decreases in erythrocyte parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit); \n stomach discoloration, ulcers and focal necrosis of gastric mucosa were observed in few rats in \n\na 6 months toxicity study at irbesartan 90 mg/kg/day, hydrochlorothiazide 90 mg/kg/day, and \nirbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 10/10 mg/kg/day. These lesions were not observed in macaques; \n\n decreases in serum potassium due to hydrochlorothiazide and partly prevented when \nhydrochlorothiazide was given in combination with irbesartan. \n\nMost of the above mentioned effects appear to be due to the pharmacological activity of irbesartan \n(blockade of angiotensin-II-induced inhibition of renin release, with stimulation of the renin-producing \ncells) and occur also with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. These findings appear to have no \nrelevance to the use of therapeutic doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide in humans. \n \nNo teratogenic effects were seen in rats given irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination at \ndoses that produced maternal toxicity. The effects of the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination \non fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies, as there is no evidence of adverse effect on \nfertility in animals or humans with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide when administered alone. \nHowever, another angiotensin-II antagonist affected fertility parameters in animal studies when given \nalone. These findings were also observed with lower doses of this other angiotensin-II antagonist when \ngiven in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \n \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity or clastogenicity with the irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide \ncombination. The carcinogenic potential of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination has not \nbeen evaluated in animal studies. \n \nIrbesartan: there was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant \ndoses. In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day in rats and \n≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, \nhaemoglobin, haematocrit). At very high doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidneys \n(such as interstitial nephritis, tubular distention, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of \nurea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered \nsecondary to the hypotensive effects of the medicinal product which led to decreased renal perfusion. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 65\n\nFurthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at \n≥ 90 mg/kg/day, in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused \nby the pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the \nhyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance. \nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity. \nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, \nhydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, \nabortion or early resorption was noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including \nmortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. \n \nHydrochlorothiazide: although equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect was found in \nsome experimental models, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to \nshow an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms. \n \n \n6.

Possible side effects \n5. How to store Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \n6. Further information \n \n \n1. WHAT IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED \nFOR \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2.

WHAT IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED \nFOR \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS  \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived \n\nmedicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in early pregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 96\n\n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

WHAT IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED \n\nFOR \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS  \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived \n\nmedicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in early pregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 104\n\n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are \nmore than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see \npregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n if you are on a low-salt diet \n if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS) \n\n if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay have an effect on other medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS without close supervision by your doctor. \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n some laxatives \n medicines for the treatment of gout \n therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n medicines to control heart rhythm \n medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins) \n\n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers or arthritis medicines. \n \nTaking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS with food and drink \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, if you drink alcohol \nwhile on treatment with this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, \nspecially when getting up from a sitting position. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 105\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS before you become pregnant or as soon \nas you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended in early \npregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to \nyour baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor \nmay choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, \nor was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you \nexperience these, talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that \nyou have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3.

You should \ncheck with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nDosage \nThe usual dose of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is one or two tablets a day.

WHAT IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED \n\nFOR \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS  \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived \n\nmedicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in early pregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 112\n\n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are \nmore than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see \npregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n if you are on a low-salt diet \n if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS) \n\n if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay have an effect on other medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS without close supervision by your doctor. \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n some laxatives \n medicines for the treatment of gout \n therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n medicines to control heart rhythm \n medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins) \n\n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers or arthritis medicines. \n \nTaking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS with food and drink \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, if you drink alcohol \nwhile on treatment with this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, \nspecially when getting up from a sitting position. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 113\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally \nadvise you to stop taking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS before you become pregnant or as soon \nas you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS. Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended in early \npregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to \nyour baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nTell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor \nmay choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, \nor was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you \nexperience these, talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that \nyou have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine. \n \n \n3.

WHAT IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED \n\nFOR \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is a combination of two active substances, irbesartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide. \nIrbesartan belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. \nAngiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body that binds to receptors in blood vessels causing \nthem to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. Irbesartan prevents the binding of \nangiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. \nHydrochlorothiazide is one of a group of medicines (called thiazide diuretics) that causes increased \nurine output and so causes a lowering of blood pressure. \nThe two active ingredients in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS work together to lower blood \npressure further than if either was given alone. \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is used to treat high blood pressure, when treatment with \nirbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone did not provide adequate control of your blood pressure. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU TAKE IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE BMS \n \nDo not take Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any of the other ingredients of Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS  \n if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hydrochlorothiazide or any other sulfonamide-derived \n\nmedicines \n if you are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid Irbesartan \n\nHydrochlorothiazide BMS in early pregnancy – see pregnancy section) \n if you have severe liver or kidney problems \n if you have difficulty in producing urine \n if your doctor determines that you have persistently high calcium or low potassium levels in \n\nyour blood \n \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS should not be given to children and adolescents (under 18 years). \n \nTake special care with Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nTell your doctor if any of the following apply to you: \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 120\n\n if you get excessive vomiting or diarrhoea \n if you suffer from kidney problems or have a kidney transplant \n if you suffer from heart problems \n if you suffer from liver problems \n if you suffer from diabetes \n if you suffer from lupus erythematosus (also known as lupus or SLE) \n if you suffer from primary aldosteronism (a condition related to high production of the \n\nhormone aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and, in turn, an increase in blood \npressure). \n\n \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are \nmore than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see \npregnancy section). \n \nYou should also tell your doctor: \n if you are on a low-salt diet \n if you have signs such as abnormal thirst, dry mouth, general weakness, drowsiness, muscle \n\npain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormally fast heart beat which may indicate an \nexcessive effect of hydrochlorothiazide (contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS) \n\n if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn \n(such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal \n\n if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics \n \nThe hydrochlorothiazide contained in this medicine could produce a positive result in an anti-doping \ntest. \n \nUsing other medicines \nPlease tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nDiuretic agents such as the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nmay have an effect on other medicines. Preparations containing lithium should not be taken with \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS without close supervision by your doctor. \n \nYou may need to have blood checks if you take: \n potassium supplements \n salt substitutes containing potassium \n potassium sparing medicines or other diuretics (water tablets) \n some laxatives \n medicines for the treatment of gout \n therapeutic vitamin D supplements \n medicines to control heart rhythm \n medicines for diabetes (oral agents or insulins) \n\n \nIt is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines to reduce your blood pressure, \nsteroids, medicines to treat cancer, pain killers or arthritis medicines. \n \nTaking Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS with food and drink \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS can be taken with or without food. \n \nDue to the hydrochlorothiazide contained in Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS, if you drink alcohol \nwhile on treatment with this medicine, you may have an increased feeling of dizziness on standing up, \nspecially when getting up from a sitting position. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n 121\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nPregnancy \nYou must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant.

Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor \nmay choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, \nor was born prematurely. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Irbesartan \nHydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, \noccasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you \nexperience these, talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines. \n \nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS \nIrbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS contains lactose.
