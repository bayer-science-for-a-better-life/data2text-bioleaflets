This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nGalafold 123 mg hard capsules  \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains migalastat hydrochloride equivalent to 123 mg migalastat.  \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule.  \nSize 2 hard capsule (6.4x18.0 mm) with an opaque blue cap and opaque white body with “A1001” \nprinted in black, containing white to pale brown powder.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nGalafold is indicated for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older with a \nconfirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who have an amenable \nmutation (see the tables in section 5.1).  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Galafold should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease. Galafold is not intended for concomitant use with enzyme \nreplacement therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dosage regimen in adults and adolescents 16 years and older is 123 mg migalastat \n(1 capsule) once every other day at the same time of day. \n \nMissed dose  \nGalafold should not be taken on 2 consecutive days. If a dose is missed entirely for the day, the patient \nshould take the missed dose of Galafold only if it is within 12 hours of the normal time the dose is \ntaken. If more than 12 hours has passed the patient should resume taking Galafold at the next planned \ndosing day and time according to the every other day dosing schedule. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Galafold in children aged 0 to 15 years has not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly population \nNo dosage adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nRenal impairment \nGalafold is not recommended for use in patients with Fabry disease who have estimated GFR less than \n30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment of Galafold is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor oral use. Galafold exposure is decreased by approximately 40% when taken with food and \ntherefore food should not be consumed at least 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking Galafold to give \na minimum 4 hours fast. Clear liquids, including carbonated drinks, can be consumed during this \nperiod. Galafold should be taken every other day at the same time of day to ensure optimal benefits to \nthe patient.  \n \nCapsules must be swallowed whole. The capsules must not be cut, crushed, or chewed.  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIt is advised to periodically monitor renal function, echocardiographic parameters and biochemical \nmarkers (every 6 months) in patients initiated on or switched to Galafold. In case of meaningful \nclinical deterioration, further clinical evaluation or discontinuation of treatment with Galafold should \nbe considered. \n \nGalafold is not indicated for use in patients with non-amenable mutations (see section 5.1).  \n \nNo reduction in proteinuria was observed in patients treated with Galafold.  \n \nGalafold is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal insufficiency, defined as estimated \nGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2 (see section 5.2). \n \nLimited data suggest that co-administration of a single dose of Galafold and a standard enzyme \nreplacement therapy infusion results in an increased exposure to agalsidase of up to 5-fold. This study \nalso indicated that agalsidase has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of migalastat. Galafold is not \nintended for concomitant use with enzyme replacement therapy. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nBased upon in vitro data, migalastat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Furthermore, \nmigalastat is not an inhibitor or a substrate of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or \n3A4/5. Migalastat is not a substrate for MDR1 or BCRP, nor is it an inhibitor of BCRP, MDR1, or \nBSEP human efflux transporters. In addition, migalastat is not a substrate for MATE1, MATE2-K, \nOAT1, OAT3, or OCT2, nor is it an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, \nMATE1, or MATE2-K human uptake transporters. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nGalafold is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPregnancy \nThere are limited data from the use of Galafold in pregnant women. In rabbits, developmental toxicity \nwas observed only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). Galafold is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Galafold is secreted in human milk. However, migalastat has been shown to \nbe expressed in the milk of lactating rats. Accordingly, a risk of migalastat exposure to the \nbreast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue Galafold, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the \nchild relative to the benefit of therapy for the mother. \n \nFertility \nThe effects of Galafold on fertility in humans have not been studied. Transient and fully reversible \ninfertility in male rats was associated with migalastat treatment at all doses assessed. Complete \nreversibility was seen after 4 weeks off-dose. Similar findings have been noted pre-clinically \nfollowing treatment with other iminosugars (see section 5.3). Migalastat did not affect fertility in \nfemale rats.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nGalafold has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most common adverse reaction was headache, which was experienced by approximately 10% of \npatients who received Galafold.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 \nto <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of \ndecreasing frequency within each System Organ Class.  \n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions with Galafold in clinical trials \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common  Common \n\nPsychiatric disorders  Depression \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Paraesthesia Dizziness \nHypoaesthesia \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders  Vertigo \n\nCardiac disorders  Palpitations \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \nmediastinal disorders \n\n Dyspnoea Epistaxis \n\n\n\n5 \n\nSystem Organ Class Very common  Common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  Diarrhoea Nausea \nAbdominal pain \nConstipation \nDry mouth \nDefaecation urgency \nDyspepsia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\n Rash Pruritus \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\n Muscle spasms Myalgia \nTorticollis \nPain in extremity \n\nRenal and urinary disorders  Proteinuria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\n Fatigue \nPain \n\nInvestigations  Blood creatine phosphokinase \nincreased \nWeight increased \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn case of overdose, general medical care is recommended. Headache and dizziness were the most \ncommon adverse reactions reported at doses of Galafold of up to 1250 mg and 2000 mg, respectively. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Various alimentary tract and metabolism products ATC code: A16AX14 \n \nFabry disease is a progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder which affects males and females. \nFabry disease-causing mutations in the GLA gene result in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme \nα-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) that is required for glycosphingolipid substrate (e.g., GL-3, lyso-Gb3) \nmetabolism. Reduced α-Gal A activity is, therefore, associated with the progressive accumulation of \nsubstrate in vulnerable organs and tissues, which leads to the morbidity and mortality associated with \nFabry disease. \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nCertain GLA mutations can result in the production of abnormally folded and unstable mutant forms of \nα-Gal A. Migalastat is a pharmacological chaperone that is designed to selectively and reversibly bind \nwith high affinity to the active sites of certain mutant forms of α-Gal A, the genotypes of which are \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n6 \n\nreferred to as amenable mutations. Migalastat binding stabilizes these mutant forms of α-Gal A in the \nendoplasmic reticulum and facilitates their proper trafficking to lysosomes. Once in lysosomes \ndissociation of migalastat restores α-Gal A activity, leading to the catabolism of GL-3 and related \nsubstrates. \n \nThe GLA mutations amenable to treatment with Galafold are listed in Table 2 below. The GLA \nmutations are also accessible by health care providers at www.galafoldamenabilitytable.com. \n \nThe nucleotide changes listed represent potential DNA sequence changes that result in the amino acid \nmutation. The amino acid mutation (protein sequence change) is most relevant when determining \namenability. If a double mutation is present on the same chromosome (males and females), that patient \nis amenable if the double mutation is present in one entry in Table 2 (e.g., D55V/Q57L). If a double \nmutation is present on different chromosomes (only in females) that patient is amenable if either one \nof the individual mutations is present in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Galafold

Phase 2 pharmacodynamic trials generally resulted in increases in \nendogenous α-Gal A activity in WBCs, as well as in skin and kidney for the majority of patients. In \npatients with amenable mutations, GL-3 levels tended to decrease in urine and in kidney interstitial \ncapillaries. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe clinical efficacy and safety of Galafold have been evaluated in two Phase 3 pivotal trials and two \nopen-label extension (OLE) trials. All patients received the recommended dosage of 123 mg Galafold \nevery other day.  \n \nThe first Phase 3 trial (ATTRACT) was a randomised open-label active comparator trial that evaluated \nthe efficacy and safety of Galafold compared to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (agalsidase beta, \nagalsidase alfa) in 52 male and female patients with Fabry disease who were receiving ERT prior to \ntrial entry and who have amenable mutations (ERT-experienced trial). The study was structured in two \nperiods. During the first period (18-months) ERT-experienced patients were randomised to switch \nfrom ERT to Galafold or continue with ERT. The second period was an optional 12-month open-label \nextension in which all subjects received Galafold. \n \nThe second Phase 3 trial (FACETS) was a 6-month randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial \n(through month 6) with an 18-month open-label period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Galafold \nin 50 male and female patients with Fabry disease who were naïve to ERT, or had previously been on \nERT and had stopped for at least 6 months and who have amenable mutations (ERT-naïve trial).  \n \nThe first OLE trial (AT1001-041) included patients from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies and has \ncompleted. The mean extent of exposure to the marketed dose of Galafold 123 mg QOD in patients \ncompleting study AT1001-041 was 3.57 (±1.23) years (n=85). The maximum exposure was 5.6 years. \n \nThe second OLE trial (AT1001-042) included patients that both transferred from OLE study \nAT1001-041 and directly from Phase 3 study ATTRACT, and is ongoing. \n \nRenal Function  \nIn the ERT-experienced trial, renal function remained stable for up to 18 months of treatment with \nGalafold. Mean annualised rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -2.272, \n1.478; n=34) in the Galafold group compared to -1.03 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -3.636, 1.575; n=18) \nin the ERT group. The mean annualised rate of change from baseline in eGFRCKD-EPI in patients treated \nfor 30 months with Galafold was -1.72 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -2.653, -0.782; n=31). \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nIn the ERT-naïve trial and open-label extension, renal function remained stable for up to 5 years of \ntreatment with Galafold. After an average of 3.4 years of treatment, the mean annualised rate of \nchange in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.74 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -1.89, 0.40; n=41). No clinically \nsignificant differences were observed during the initial 6-month placebo-controlled period. \n \nLeft Ventricular Mass Index (LVMi)  \nIn the ERT-experienced trial, following 18 months of treatment with Galafold there was a statistically \nsignificant decrease in LVMi (p<0.05). The baseline values were 95.3 g/m2 for the Galafold arm and \n92.9 g/m2 for the ERT arm and the mean change from baseline in LVMi at Month 18 was  \n-6.6 (95% CI: -11.0, -2.1; n=31) for Galafold and -2.0 (95% CI: -11.0, 7.0; n=13) for ERT. The change \nfrom baseline to Month 18 in LVMi (g/m2) in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (females with \nbaseline LVMi >95 g/m2 and males with baseline LVMi >115 g/m2) was -8.4 (95% CI: -15.7, 2.6; \nn=13) for migalastat and 4.5 (95% CI: -10.7, 18.4; n=5) for ERT. After 30 months treatment with \nGalafold, the mean change from baseline in LVMi was -3.8 (95% CI: -8.9, 1.3; n=28) and the mean \nchange from baseline in LVMi in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline was  \n-10.0 (95% CI: -16.6, -3.3; n=10). \n \nIn the ERT-naïve trial, Galafold resulted in a statistically significant decrease in LVMi (p<0.05); the \nmean change from baseline in LVMi at Month 18 to 24 was -7.7 (95% CI: -15.4, -0.01; n=27). After \nfollow up in the OLE, the mean change from baseline in LVMi at Month 36 was -8.3 (95% CI: -17.1, \n0.4; n=25) and at Month 48 was -9.1 (95% CI: -20.3, 2.0; n=18). The mean change from baseline in \nLVMi at Month 18 to 24 in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline (females with \nbaseline LVMi >95 g/m2 or males with baseline LVMi >115 g/m2) was -18.6 (95% CI: -38.2, 1.0; \nn=8). After follow up in the OLE, the mean change from baseline in LVMi in patients with left \nventricular hypertrophy at baseline at Month 36 was -30.0 (95%) CI: -57.9, -2.2; n=4) and at Month 48 \nwas -33.1 (CI: -60.9, -5.4; n=4). No clinically significant differences in LVMi were observed during \nthe initial 6-month placebo-controlled period. \n \nDisease Substrate \nIn the ERT-experienced trial, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels slightly increased but remained low in patients \nwith amenable mutations treated with Galafold for the 30 month duration of the study. Plasma \nlyso-Gb3 levels also remained low in patients on ERT for up to 18 months. \n \nIn the ERT- naïve trial, Galafold showed statistically significant reductions in plasma lyso-Gb3 \nconcentrations and kidney interstitial capillary GL-3 inclusions in patients with amenable mutations. \nPatients randomised to Galafold in Stage 1 demonstrated statistically significant greater reduction \n(±SEM) in mean interstitial capillary GL-3 deposition (-0.25±0.10; -39%) at month 6 compared to \nplacebo (+0.07 ± 0.13; +14%) (p=0.008). Patients randomised to placebo in Stage 1 and switched to \nGalafold at month 6 (Stage 2) also demonstrated statistically significant decreases in interstitial \ncapillary GL-3 inclusions at month 12 (-0.33±0.15; -58%) (p=0.014). Qualitative reductions in GL-3 \nlevels were observed in multiple renal cell types: podocytes, mesangial cells, and glomerular \nendothelial cells, respectively, over 12 months of treatment with Galafold.  \n \nComposite Clinical Outcomes \nIn the ERT-experienced trial, an analysis of a composite clinical outcome composed of renal, cardiac, \nand cerebrovascular events, or death, showed that the frequency of events observed in the Galafold \ntreatment group was 29% compared to 44% in the ERT group over 18 months. The frequency of \nevents in patients treated with Galafold over 30 months (32%) was similar to the 18 month period.  \n \nPatient-Reported Outcome - Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale \nIn the ERT-naïve trial, analyses of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale demonstrated that \ntreatment with Galafold was associated with statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements versus \nplacebo from baseline to month 6 in the diarrhoea domain, and in the reflux domain for patients with \nsymptoms at baseline. During the open-label extension, statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements \nfrom baseline were observed in the diarrhoea and indigestion domains, with a trend of improvement in \nthe constipation domain. \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nGalafold in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Fabry disease (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nThe absolute bioavailability (AUC) for a single oral 150 mg migalastat hydrochloride dose or a single \n2-hour 150 mg intravenous infusion was approximately 75%. Following a single oral dose of 150 mg \nmigalastat hydrochloride solution, the time to peak plasma concentration was approximately 3 hours. \nPlasma migalastat exposure (AUC0-∞) and Cmax demonstrated dose-proportional increases at migalastat \nhydrochloride oral doses from 50 mg to 1,250 mg. \n \nMigalastat administered with a high-fat meal, or 1 hour before a high-fat or light meal, or 1 hour after \na light meal, resulted in significant reductions of 37% to 42% in mean total migalastat exposure \n(AUC0-∞) and reductions of 15% to 40% in mean peak migalastat exposure (Cmax) compared with the \nfasting state (see section 4.2).  \n \nDistribution \n \nIn healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution (Vz/F) of migalastat following ascending single oral \ndoses (25-675 mg migalastat HCl) ranged from 77 to 133 L, indicating it is well distributed into \ntissues and greater than total body water (42 litres). There was no detectable plasma protein binding \nfollowing administration of [14C]-migalastat hydrochloride in the concentration range between 1 and \n100 µM. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nBased upon in vivo data, migalastat is a substrate for UGT, being a minor elimination pathway. \nMigalastat is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gP) in vitro and it is considered unlikely that \nmigalastat would be subject to drug-drug interactions with cytochrome P450s. A pharmacokinetic trial \nin healthy male volunteers with 150 mg [14C]-migalastat HCl revealed that 99% of the radiolabeled \ndose recovered in plasma was comprised of unchanged migalastat (77%) and 3 dehydrogenated \nO-glucuronide conjugated metabolites, M1to M3 (13%). Approximately 9% of the total radioactivity \nwas unassigned.  \n \nElimination \n \nA pharmacokinetic trial in healthy male volunteers with 150 mg [14C]-migalastat hydrochloride \nrevealed that approximately 77% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine of which 55% of was \nexcreted as unchanged migalastat and 4% as combined metabolites M1, M2 and M3. Approximately \n5% of the total sample radioactivity was unassigned components. Approximately 20% of the total \nradiolabeled dose was excreted in faeces, with unchanged migalastat being the only measured \ncomponent. \n \nFollowing ascending single oral doses (25-675 mg migalastat hydrochloride), no trends were found for \nclearance, CL/F). At the 150 mg dose, CL/F was approximately 11 to 14 L/hr. Following \nadministration of the same doses, the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) ranged from approximately 3 to \n5 hours.  \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment \nGalafold has not been studied in patients with Fabry disease who have a GFR less than \n30 mL/min/1.73 m2. In a single dose study with Galafold in non-Fabry subjects with varying degrees \nof renal insufficiency, exposures were increased by 4.3-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment \n(GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nNo studies have been carried out in subjects with impaired hepatic function. From the metabolism and \nexcretion pathways, it is not expected that a decreased hepatic function may affect the \npharmacokinetics of migalastat. \n \nElderly (>65 years) \nClinical studies of Galafold included small number of patients aged 65 and over. The effect of age was \nevaluated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis on plasma migalastat clearance in the ERT-naïve \nstudy population. The difference in clearance between Fabry patients ≥65 years and those <65 years \nwas 20%, which was not considered clinically significant. \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of migalastat were not significantly different between females and \nmales in either healthy volunteers or in patients with Fabry disease. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\nNon-clinical studies suggest no specific hazard for humans on the basis of single-and repeat-dose \nstudies, with the exception of transient and fully reversible infertility in male rats associated with \nmigalastat treatment. The infertility associated with migalastat treatment was reported at clinically \nrelevant exposures. Complete reversibility was seen after 4 weeks off-dose. Similar findings have been \nnoted pre-clinically following treatment with other iminosugars. In the rabbit embryo-foetal toxicity \nstudy, findings including embryo-foetal death, a reduction in mean foetal weight, retarded ossification, \nand slightly increased incidences of minor skeletal abnormalities were observed only at doses \nassociated with maternal toxicity. \n \nIn a rat 104-week carcinogenicity study, there was an increased incidence of pancreatic islet cell \nadenomas in males at a dose level 19-fold higher than the exposure (AUC) at the clinically efficacious \ndose. This is a common spontaneous tumour in ad libitum-fed male rats. In the absence of similar \nfindings in females, no findings in the genotoxicity battery or in the carcinogenicity study with \nTg.rasH2 mice, and no pre-neoplastic pancreatic findings in the rodents or monkeys, this observation \nin male rats is not considered related to treatment and its relevance to humans is unknown.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n50 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nGalafold 123 mg hard capsules \nMigalastat \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Galafold is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Galafold \n3. How to take Galafold \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Galafold \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Galafold is and what it is used for  \n \nGalafold contains the active substance migalastat. \n \nThis medicine is used for the long-term treatment of Fabry disease in adults and adolescents aged \n16 years and older who have certain genetic mutations (changes).  \n \nFabry disease is caused by the lack of or a faulty enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). \nDepending upon the kind of mutation (change) in the gene that produces α-Gal A, the enzyme does \nnot work properly or is completely absent. This enzyme defect leads to abnormal deposits of a fatty \nsubstance known as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in kidneys, heart, and other organs, leading to the \nsymptoms of Fabry disease.  \n \nThis medicine works by stabilising the enzyme that your body produces naturally, so that it can work \nbetter to reduce the amount of GL-3 that has accumulated in your cells and tissues. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Galafold \n \nDo not take Galafold if you: \n\n• are allergic to migalastat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Galafold if you are currently taking enzyme replacement therapy. \nYou should not take Galafold if you are also receiving enzyme replacement therapy.  \n \nYour doctor will monitor your condition and whether your medicine is working every 6 months while \nyou are taking Galafold. If your condition worsens, your doctor may evaluate you further or may \ndiscontinue your treatment with Galafold. \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine has not been studied in children and adolescents under the age of 16 years; therefore, \nthe safety and efficacy in this age group has not been established. \n \nOther medicines and Galafold \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines because certain other medicines may increase or decrease the amount of Galafold in your \nbody.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility \n \nPregnancy \nThere is very limited experience with the use of this medicine in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, \nthink you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, do not take this medicine until you have \nchecked with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. While taking Galafold you should use effective birth \ncontrol.  \n \nBreast-feeding \nDo not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding, until you have spoken with your doctor, \npharmacist, or nurse. It is not yet known whether this medicine passes into breast milk. Your doctor \nwill decide whether you need to stop breast-feeding or temporarily stop your medicine. \n \nFertility in men \nIt is not yet known if this medicine affects fertility in men. The effects of Galafold on fertility in \nhumans have not been studied. \n \nFertility in women \nIt is not yet known if this medicine affects fertility in women. \n \nIf you are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nIt is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take Galafold \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nTake one capsule every other day at the same time of the day. Do not take Galafold on two \nconsecutive days. \n \nDo not eat food at least 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking your medicine.
