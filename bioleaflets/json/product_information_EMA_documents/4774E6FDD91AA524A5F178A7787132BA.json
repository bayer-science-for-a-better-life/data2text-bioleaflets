This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nProvenge 50 x 106 CD54+ cells/250mL dispersion for infusion. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n2.1 General description \n \nAutologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated with PAP-GM-CSF (Sipuleucel-T). \n \n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition \n \nOne bag contains autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated with PAP-GM-CSF \n(prostatic acid phosphatase-granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor), including a minimum \nof 50 x 106 autologous CD54+ cells. \n \nThe cellular composition and the cell number per dose of Provenge will vary according to the \npatient’s leukapheresis.  In addition to antigen presenting cells (APCs), the final product thus contains \nT cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 800 mg of sodium and 45 mg of potassium per \ninfusion. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersion for infusion. \nThe dispersion is slightly cloudy, with a cream-to-pink colour. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProvenge is indicated for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic (non-\nvisceral) castrate resistant prostate cancer in male adults in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically \nindicated. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nProvenge must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the medical \ntreatment of prostate cancer and in an environment where availability of resuscitation equipment must \nbe ensured. \n \nPosology \nOne dose of Provenge contains a minimum of 50 x 106 autologous CD54+ cells activated with \nPAP-GM-CSF, suspended in 250 mL of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, in a sealed, patient-specific \npolyolefin bag. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThe recommended course of treatment is 3 doses at approximately 2-week intervals.  Each dose of \nProvenge is preceded by a standard leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days prior to the \nscheduled infusion date.  Prior to the first leukapheresis procedure, a complete blood count (CBC) test \nshould be performed and be within ranges acceptable for the local facility.  Additional CBC tests may \nbe performed in accordance with local requirements. \n \nIf, for any reason, the patient is unable to receive a scheduled infusion of Provenge, the patient will \nneed to undergo an additional leukapheresis procedure if the course of treatment is to be continued.  \nPatients should be advised of this possibility prior to initiating treatment.  In controlled clinical trials, \n25.4% of patients treated with Provenge required more than 3 leukapheresis procedures in order to \nreceive 3 infusions.  In post-marketing experience of greater than 5,000 patients treated, this incidence \nis approximately 19% (see section 4.4).  In controlled clinical trials, the dosing interval range was 1 – \n15 weeks (see section 5.1). \n \nPremedication \nAcute infusion reactions such as chills, fatigue, fever, nausea, and joint ache were frequently observed \nin clinical studies.  To mitigate such reactions, premedication, consisting of paracetamol and an \nantihistamine was administered in clinical studies prior to infusion. \n \nTo minimize potential acute infusion reactions such as chills and/or fever, it is recommended that \npatients be pre-medicated orally with paracetamol and an antihistamine approximately 30 minutes \nprior to administration of Provenge.  The doses of paracetamol and antihistamine given should be in \naccordance with local practice. \n \nIn case of using premedication, the status of the patient and possible contraindications/interactions \nshould be taken into account. \n \nDose adjustments \nIn the event of an acute infusion reaction, the infusion may be interrupted or slowed, depending on the \nseverity of the reaction.  Appropriate medical therapy, which could include paracetamol, intravenous \nH1 and/or H2 blockers, and low dose intravenous pethidine, should be administered as needed. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, 23.8% of patients treated with Provenge required opioids (a single dose of \npethidine) on the day of infusion for infusion reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \n \nIf the infusion of Provenge must be interrupted, it should not be resumed if the infusion bag has been \nheld at room temperature (25°C) for more than 3 hours (see section 6.3). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nOlder people \nNo dose adjustment is required in the elderly population. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nProvenge has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment.  No specific dose \nrecommendation can be provided in these patients. \n \nPatients with renal impairment and/or hyperkalaemia and/or on a controlled potassium diet \nProvenge has not been investigated in patients with renal impairment.  The potassium content per \ninfusion should be taken into account if administered to patients with renal impairment and/or those \non a controlled potassium diet.  Hyperkalaemia should be corrected prior to Provenge administration \n(see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThere is no relevant use of Provenge in the paediatric population in children and adolescents less than \n18 years of age in the indication of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic (non-visceral) \ncastrate resistant prostate cancer in male adults in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. \n \nMethod of administration  \nProvenge is solely intended for autologous use via intravenous infusion. \n \nProvenge should be infused intravenously over a period of approximately 60 minutes.  The entire \nvolume of the bag should be infused.  A cell filter should not be used.  Vital signs should be taken at \nleast 30 minutes prior to and 30 minutes following each infusion.  Patients should be observed for at \nleast 30 minutes following each infusion.  For patients with cardiovascular disease or those at risk for \ncardiac ischaemia, physicians should consider observing patients for at least 60 minutes following \neach infusion with vital signs taken at 30 minutes and 60 minutes following the infusion. \n \nIf the infusion of Provenge must be interrupted, it should not be resumed if the infusion bag has been \nheld at room temperature (25°C) for more than 3 hours. \n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nProvenge is not tested for transmissible infectious diseases and hence may carry the risk of \ntransmitting infectious diseases to healthcare professionals handling the product.  Appropriate \nprecautions should be employed when handling Provenge (see section 4.4). \n \nIt must be ensured that the APPROVED Final Product Disposition Notification form has been \nreceived from the marketing authorisation holder and the product has not expired (see section 6.6). \n \nBefore infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient’s identity matches the essential unique patient \ninformation on the Provenge bag and on the Final Product Disposition Notification form. \n \nThe bag should be removed from the insulated polyurethane container and inspected for leaks, \nexternal damage, foreign particulate matter, or clumps/clots. \n \nContents of the bag will be slightly cloudy, with a cream to pink colour.  Gently mix and re-suspend \nthe contents of the bag, inspecting for particles, clumps or clots.  Small clumps of cellular material \nshould disperse with gentle manual mixing. \n \nDo not administer if the bag leaks during handling or if particles or clumps remain in the bag. \n \nFor full instructions on the preparation and handling of Provenge, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral \nProvenge is intended solely for autologous use and should under no circumstances be administered to \nother patients.  Prior to infusion, it must be confirmed that the patient’s identity matches the essential \nunique patient information on the Provenge bag and on the Final Product Disposition Notification \nform (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). \n \nAcute infusion reactions \nAcute infusion reactions have been observed in patients treated with Provenge.  Acute infusion \nreactions (reported within 1 day of infusion) included, but were not limited to, fever, chills, \nrespiratory events (dyspnoea, hypoxia, and bronchospasm), nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypertension, \nand tachycardia.  In the event of an acute infusion reaction, the infusion rate may be decreased, or the \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n5 \n\ninfusion stopped, depending on the severity of the reaction.  Appropriate medical therapy should be \nadministered as needed.  \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, 23.8% of patients treated with Provenge required opioids (a single dose of \npethidine) on the day of infusion for infusion reactions (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).   \n \nPatients with cardiac or pulmonary conditions should be closely monitored (see section 4.8). \n \nInfection \nPatients with positive serology tests for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 1 and 2, human T cell \nlymphotropic virus [HTLV] 1, and hepatitis B and C were excluded from controlled clinical trials.  \nNo data are available for these patients. \n \nProvenge should be delayed in patients with active systemic infection until resolution.  Serious \ninfections including sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Provenge.  Some serious \ninfections and sepsis were related to the use of central venous catheters (CVCs).  To reduce the risk of \ncatheter-related infections, CVCs should be considered only for patients with poor peripheral venous \naccess.  These  patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection. \n \nEmbolic and thrombotic events \nProvenge should be used with caution in patients with a history of embolic and thrombotic disorders. \n \nCerebrovascular disease \nIn controlled clinical trials, cerebrovascular events (hemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes) were \nobserved in 3.5% of patients in the Provenge group compared with 2.6% of patients in the control \ngroup.  The clinical significance is uncertain. \n \nCardiovascular disorders \nIn controlled clinical trials, myocardial infarctions were observed in 0.8% of patients in the Provenge \ngroup compared with 0.3% of patients in the control group.  The clinical significance is uncertain. \n \nImmunocompromised patients \nProvenge should be used with caution in immunocompromised patients in general including patients \ntaking systemic immunosuppressive therapy, after careful consideration of the potential risk-benefit \non an individiual basis.  No data are available for these patients.  \n \nMicrobiological testing \nProvenge is released for infusion based on the microbial and sterility results from several tests: \nmicrobial contamination determination by Gram stain, endotoxin content, and in-process sterility with \na 2-day incubation to determine absence of microbial growth.  The final (7-day incubation) sterility \ntest results will not be available at the time of infusion.  If the sterility results become positive for \nmicrobial contamination after Provenge has been approved for infusion, the marketing authorisation \nholder will notify the treating physician and may request additional information from the physician in \norder to determine the source of contamination.  The physician should monitor and/or treat the patient \nas appropriate. \n \nHandling precautions for control of infectious disease \nProvenge is prepared from human blood of the specific patient and is not  tested for transmissible \ninfectious agents.  Patient leukapheresis material is tested for transmissible infectious agents in line \nwith applicable member state requirements.  However, as Provenge is an autologous product, a \npositive test does not preclude the manufacture of the product.  Therefore, patient leukapheresis \nmaterial and Provenge may carry the risk of transmitting infectious viruses (HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B \nand C) to healthcare professionals handling the product.  Accordingly, healthcare professionals should \nemploy appropriate precautions when handling leukapheresis material or Provenge. \n \nAdditionally, there is the small possibility/risk of transmitting infectious viruses to a patient if he is \nnot the intended recipient of the product.  Hence it is important that the procedures for handling and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n6 \n\nadministering the product are precisely followed (see section 6.6).  It is strongly recommended that \nupon completion of each Provenge infusion, the patient specific label on the infusion bag, which \ncontains the patient name, product name, and chain of identity (COI) product lot number, is removed \nand adhered to the patient file in order to maintain a link between the patient and the lot of the \nproduct. \n \nCases in which Provenge cannot be infused \nIn some cases, the patient may be unable to receive a scheduled infusion of Provenge.  This may be \ndue to release criteria not being met during manufacturing, the expiration time being exceeded, or the \npatient being unable to meet the scheduled infusion time.  In such cases, the patient may need to \nundergo an additional leukapheresis procedure if the treatment is to be continued.  It is recommended \nthat the minimum interval between leukapheresis procedures should not be less than 2 weeks.  In \ncontrolled clinical trials, 25.4% of patients treated with Provenge required more than 3 leukapheresis \nprocedures in order to receive 3  infusions.  In post-marketing experience of greater than 5,000 \npatients treated, this incidence is approximately 19% (see section 4.2).   \n \nImmunisations \nThe risks and benefits of vaccinating patients during the course of treatment with Provenge have not \nbeen studied.  Therefore, vaccinations with live attenuated or inactivated vaccines whilst receiving \nProvenge should be carefully considered. \n \nEducational materials \nAll physicians who intend to prescribe Provenge must review the educational materials and sign the \ntraining verification form.  Physicians must provide the educational materials to the patient as well as \nthe package leaflet and the Patient Alert Card.    \n \nSodium and potassium content \nThis medicinal product contains approximately 800 mg sodium per infusion.  To be taken into \nconsideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.  The product also contains approximately 45 \nmg potassium per infusion.  To be taken into consideration by patients with reduced kidney function \nor patients on a controlled potassium diet. \n \nPatients with renal impairment and/or hyperkalaemia \nThe content of sodium and potassium per infusion should be taken into account if administered in \npatients with cardiovascular diseases and/or renal impairment.  Hyperkalaemia should be corrected \nprior to Provenge administration (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Provenge. \n \nProvenge is designed to stimulate the immune system.  Immunocompromised patients and patients \ntaking systemic immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from controlled clinical trials.  Concurrent \nuse of immunosuppressive agents (such as systemic corticosteroids) may alter its efficacy and/or \nsafety.  Therefore, concurrent use of immunosuppressive agents (such as systemic corticosteroids) \nshould be avoided during Provenge treatment.  Patients should be carefully evaluated to determine \nwhether it is medically appropriate to discontinue immunosuppressive agents prior to treatment with \nProvenge (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nProvenge is not intended for use in women. \n \nBreast-feeding \nProvenge is not intended for use in women. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n7 \n\nFertility \nEffect on male fertility is not known. \n \nConventional reproductive and development toxicity studies are not considered relevant given the \nnature and the intended clinical use of this autologous cell therapy product. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nProvenge has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines, as it may cause fatigue, \ndizziness, syncope, chills, and headache.  Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if \nthey experience these symptoms following their infusion.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \nThe safety evaluation of Provenge is based on data from 601 prostate cancer patients in four \nrandomized, controlled clinical trials (3 studies in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and 1 \nstudy in androgen dependent prostate cancer) and post-marketing surveillance. \n \nSerious adverse reactions include acute infusion reactions, catheter sepsis, staphylococcal \nbacteraemia, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events. \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are chills, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, arthralgia, \nheadache, and vomiting. \n \nIn the pivotal randomised controlled study (D9902B, IMPACT, see section 5.1) Provenge was \ndiscontinued in 1.5% of patients due to adverse reactions.  Some patients developed infection, \nincluding sepsis.  Infections due to contaminated product also occurred in some patients.  A small \nnumber of these patients discontinued treatment as a result.   \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on post-\nmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency of occurrence: very \ncommon (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1 Adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-marketing reports \n \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations Common Bacteraemia \n\nUncommon Catheter sepsis \nCatheter related infection \nCatheter site infection \nSepsis \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nVery common Anaemia* \nCommon Thrombocytopenia* \nUncommon Eosinophilia \n\nNervous system disorders Very common Dizziness \nParaesthesia* \nParaesthesia oral* \nHeadache \n\nCommon Cerebrovascular accident \nTransient ischaemic attack \nTremor \nHypoaesthesia \nSpinal cord compression \nSyncope \n\n Uncommon Cerebral infarction \nCardiac disorders Common Atrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Myocardial infarction \nMyocardial ischaemia \n\nVascular disorders Common Hypertension \nHypotension \n\nRespiratory, thoracic, and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon Hypoxia \nWheezing \nDyspnoea \n\nUncommon Bronchospasm \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\nVery common \n \n\nVomiting \nNausea \n\nCommon Abdominal pain \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon Rash \nHyperhidrosis \nPruritus \nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nVery common Arthralgia \nMyalgia \n\nCommon Muscle spasms* \nRenal and urinary disorders Common Haematuria \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n \n \n\nVery common Chills \nFatigue \nPyrexia \nPain \nAsthenia \n\nCommon Influenza-like illness \nChest discomfort \n\nUncommon Infusion site reaction \nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nVery common Citrate toxicity* \n\n* Primarily associated with the leukapheresis procedure \n \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n9 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nAcute infusion reactions \nIn controlled clinical trials, 71.2% of patients in the Provenge group developed an acute infusion \nreaction.  The most common reactions (≥ 20%) were chills, fever, and fatigue.  In 95.1% of patients \nreporting acute infusion reactions, the events were mild or moderate.  Fevers and chills generally \nresolved within 2 days (71.9% and 89.0%, respectively). \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, severe (Grade 3) acute infusion reactions were reported in 3.5% of \npatients in the Provenge group.  Reactions included chills, fever, fatigue, asthenia, dyspnoea, hypoxia, \nbronchospasm, dizziness, headache, hypertension, muscle ache, nausea, and vomiting.  The incidence \nof severe reactions was greater following the second infusion (2.1% vs. 0.8% following the first \ninfusion), and decreased to 1.3% following the third infusion.  Some (1.2%) patients in the Provenge \ngroup were hospitalized within 1 day of infusion for management of acute infusion reactions.  No \nGrade 4 or 5 acute infusion reactions were reported in patients in the Provenge group. \n \nIn controlled clinical trials, 23.8% of patients in the Provenge group required opioids (a single dose of \npethidine) on the day of infusion for infusion reactions compared with 2.4% of patients in control \ngroup (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, serious acute infusion reactions involving hypotension and syncope \nhave been reported.  Some have resulted in hospitalization.  \n \nPatients should be informed of the possibility of late onset reactions and instructed to contact their \nphysician if symptoms of dyspnoea, bronchospasm, dizziness, rash, or pyrexia occur. \n \nInfection \nIn controlled clinical trials, infection occurred in 27.5% of subjects in the Provenge group and 27.7% \nof subjects in the control group.  Serious infections occurred in 4.7% of subjects in the Provenge \ngroup and 4.0% of subjects in the control group.  The most frequently occurring serious infections in \nthe Provenge group were catheter sepsis (0.7%), staphylococcal bacteraemia (0.7%), sepsis (0.7%), \nstaphylococcal sepsis (0.5%), and pneumonia (0.5%).  \n \nReports of serious infection have been received in post-marketing surveillance including device-\nrelated infection, device-related sepsis, pneumonia, sepsis, bacteraemia, and urinary tract infection. \n \nAdverse reactions associated with leukapheresis \nEach dose of Provenge requires a standard leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days prior to the \ninfusion.  Citrate is generally the preferred anticoagulant used during leukapheresis and can result in \nhypocalcaemia.  Adverse reactions that were reported most commonly ≤ 1 day following a \nleukapheresis procedure in controlled clinical trials included citrate toxicity (14.6%), oral paraesthesia \n(12.0%), and paraesthesia (11.1%).  Additional adverse reactions that were seen commonly ≤ 1 day \nfollowing a leukapheresis procedure in controlled clinical trials included fatigue (5.5%), muscle \nspasm (4.0%), chills (3.0%), dizziness (2.8%), and anaemia (2.8%).  Additionally, there have been \nreports of thrombocytopenia received in spontaneous post-marketing reporting that have been \ntemporally associated with leukapheresis. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEach Provenge infusion comprises the maximum number of cells that can be manufactured from a \nsingle leukapheresis procedure.  The number of cells in Provenge does not exceed the number of cells \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n10 \n\nfrom the leukapheresis.  There are no known instances of overdose from either a single infusion or a \nfull course of therapy with Provenge. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, other immunostimulants, ATC code: L03AX17. \n \nMechanism of action \nProvenge is an autologous cellular immunotherapy designed to induce an immune response targeted \nagainst prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), an antigen expressed in most prostate cancers.  Peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells collected from the patients are cultured with PAP-GM-CSF, a fusion protein \nconsisting of PAP linked to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) an immune \ncell activator.  During ex vivo culture with PAP-GM-CSF, activated APCs (antigen presenting cells) \ntake up and process the recombinant target antigen into peptides that are then presented to T cells.  \nProduct characterization shows that PAP and PAP-GM-CSF fusion protein-specific T cells are \ngenerated during treatment and are detected in the peripheral blood of patients after treatment with \nProvenge. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nAs part of lot release, each product is assessed for activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) by \nvirtue of increased surface CD54 expression after culture with PAP-GM-CSF.  CD54 is an adhesion \nand costimulatory molecule essential in the formation of the immunological synapse between an APC \nand a T cell.  The degree of CD54 upregulation correlates with overall survival in the randomised \ncontrolled clinical trials carried out with Provenge in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.  In \nclinical study D9902B (IMPACT), 237 out of the 512 patients randomized were evaluated for the \ndevelopment of humoral or cellular immune responses (T cell proliferation and gamma-interferon \n(γIFN) ELISPOT) to the target antigens at baseline, and at Weeks 6, 14, and 26.  Antibody (IgM and \nIgG) responses against both PAP-GM-CSF and the PAP antigens were observed in the Provenge \ngroup through the follow up period.  T cell proliferative and γIFN ELISPOT responses to PAP and \nPAP-GM-CSF were observed in cells collected from peripheral blood of patients through the \nfollow-up period in the Provenge treatment group but not in controls.  There was a correlation \nbetween cellular or antibody responses to PAP or PAP-GM-CSF in the Provenge group and improved \nsurvival.  Neutralising antibody responses to GM-CSF were transient. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe efficacy and safety of Provenge in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic \nmetastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer were studied in three similar Phase III, randomised, \ndouble-blind, controlled, multicentre trials: D9902B (IMPACT), D9901, and D9902A.  The patients \nenrolled in these trials had failed surgical or medical castration (e.g. luteinising hormone-releasing \nhormone [LHRH] agonist or gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRh] antagonist) therapies and had \nmetastatic disease in the soft tissue and/or bone.  Patients did not require opioid analgesics for pain \nmanagement and the majority had not received prior chemotherapy. \n \nFollowing randomization, patients from both treatment groups underwent a series of 3 leukapheresis \nprocedures (at approximately 2 week intervals, range 1 to 15 weeks).  Each leukapheresis was \nfollowed approximately 3 days later by infusion of Provenge or control.  The control was non-\nactivated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Following disease progression, patients \nwere treated at the physician’s discretion with other anti-cancer interventions.  Patients in the control \ngroup could enrol in an open-label protocol and receive an investigational autologous cellular therapy \nmanufactured from cells cryopreserved at the time the control product was prepared. \n \nIMPACT study \nThe IMPACT study was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial in patients with \nasymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.  Eligible \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n11 \n\npatients had metastatic disease in the soft tissue and/or bone with current or historical evidence of \ndisease progression concomitant with surgical or medical castration, as evidenced by progression of \nserum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or bone or soft tissue disease, and an Eastern Cooperative \nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.  Exclusion criteria included visceral (liver, \nlung, or brain) metastases, malignant pleural effusions or malignant ascites, pathologic long bone \nfractures, imminent pathologic long-bone fractures (cortical erosion on radiography >50%), spinal \ncord compression, moderate to severe prostate cancer-related pain and use of narcotics for cancer-\nrelated pain, and treatment with chemotherapy at least 3 months prior to randomisation.  The primary \nendpoint was overall survival.  Secondary endpoints included time to objective disease progression, \ntime to clinical progression, and PSA doubling time (PSADT). \n \nA total of 512 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Provenge (n=341) or control (n=171).  \nThe median age was 71, 90% of the patients were Caucasian, and all had a life expectancy of at least \n6 months.  Thirty-five percent of patients had undergone radical prostatectomy, 54% had received \nlocal radiotherapy, and 82% had received combined androgen blockade.  All patients had baseline \ntestosterone levels < 50 ng/mL.  Forty-eight percent of patients were receiving bisphosphonates and \n18% had received prior chemotherapy, including docetaxel.  Eighty-two percent of patients had an \nECOG performance status of 0; 75% had a Gleason sum ≤ 7; 44% had bone and soft tissue disease; \n48% had bone-only disease; 7% had soft tissue-only disease; and 43% had greater than ten bony \nmetastases. \n \nA statistically significant improvement in overall survival was seen in patients treated with Provenge, \nwith a 22.5% reduction in the risk of death compared with control (see Table 2 and Figure 1).  Of the \ncontrol arm patients, 64% crossed over to receive an investigational autologous cellular \nimmunotherapy manufactured from cells cryopreserved at the time the control was manufactured; \npatients were not randomised to subsequent autologous cellular immunotherapy.   \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFigure 1 Kaplan-Meier overall survival curve, IMPACT study \n\n \n \n \nA retrospective subgroup analysis has suggested a greater Provenge treatment effect in patients with a \nbaseline PSA < 22.1 ng/mL [HR= 0.521 (95% CI:  0.309, 0.879)].  Intermediate results were observed \nin patients with baseline PSA > 22.1 to 50.1 ng/mL [HR=0.685 (95% CI:  0.431, 1.088)] and patients \nwith baseline PSA > 50.1 to 134.1 ng/mL [HR=0.819 (95% CI:  0.532, 1.262)].  A smaller treatment \neffect was observed in those with baseline PSA > 134.1 ng/mL [HR=0.853 (95% CI:  0.554, 1.315)].   \n \nAnalyses of time to objective disease progression, time to clinical progression, or PSA doubling time \n(PSADT) did not meet statistical significance. \n \nSupportive studies \nStudy D9901 was a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial in patients with metastatic \ncastrate resistant prostate cancer and no cancer-related pain.  The primary endpoint was time to \ndisease progression, which did not reach statistical significance.  Overall survival was not a study \nendpoint but a pre-specified analysis.  Patients treated with Provenge had a statistically significant \nsurvival advantage compared with control. \n \nA third study, D9902A, similar in design to study D9901, was terminated prior to completion of \nplanned accrual based on the time to disease progression results in study D9901.  The primary \nendpoint was time to disease progression and the secondary endpoint was overall survival.  Neither \nendpoint met statistical significance. \n \nSummary of study results \nTable 2 presents overall survival results observed in IMPACT, study D9901, and study D9902A. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTable 2 Summary of overall survival (all patients as randomized) \n \n IMPACT D9901 D9902A \n Provenge \n\n(N=341) \nControl \n(N=171) \n\nProvenge \n(N=82) \n\nControl \n(N=45) \n\nProvenge \n(N=65) \n\nControl \n(N=33) \n\nOverall survival       \n Median, months \n (95% CI) \n\n25.8 \n(22.8, 27.7) \n\n21.7 \n(17.7, 23.8) \n\n25.9 \n(20.0, 32.4) \n\n21.4 \n(12.3, 25.8) \n\n19.0 \n(13.6, 31.9) \n\n15.7 \n(12.8, 25.4) \n\n Hazard ratio \n (95% CI) 0.775\n\na (0.614, 0.979) 0.586b (0.388, 0.884) 0.786b (0.484, 1.278) \n\n p-value 0.032a  0.010c  0.331 c   \n 36-month \n survival (%) \n\n32% 23% 34% 11% 32% 21% \n\na Hazard ratio and p-value based on the Cox Model adjusted for PSA (ln) and LDH (ln) and stratified by \nbisphosphonate use, number of bone metastases, and primary Gleason grade. \n\nb Hazard ratio based on the unadjusted Cox Model. \nc  p-value based on a log-rank test. \nAbbreviations:  CI = confidence interval. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nProvenge in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of prostate cancer (see section 4.2 \nfor information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nProvenge is an autologous cellular therapy.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and \nconditions should not exceed 3 hours at room temperature (25°C). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore the bag in the insulated container to maintain the correct storage temperature (2°C–8°C) until \ninfusion.   \nDo not refrigerate or freeze the container.   \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container and special equipment for use, administration or \nimplantation \n \n250 mL dispersion in a bag (breathable polyolefin tri-laminate with 3 sample ports (2 spike ports and \n1 port with sealed tubing)). \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nProvenge is intended solely for autologous use.  The identity of the patient must be matched with the \nessential unique patient information on the infusion bag and the Final Product Disposition \nNotification form prior to infusion.   \n \nProvenge is not  tested for transmissible infectious agents.  Patient leukapheresis material is tested for \ntransmissible infectious agents in line with applicable member state requirements.  However, as it is \nan autologous product, a positive test does not preclude the manufacture of the product.  Therefore \npatient leukapheresis material and Provenge may carry the risk of transmitting infectious diseases to \nhealthcare professionals handling the product.  Accordingly, healthcare professionals should employ \nappropriate precautions when handling leukapheresis material or Provenge (see section 4.4). \n \nHandling instructions \n \nBefore handling or administering Provenge \n\n•  Provenge is shipped directly to the medical facility where the infusion will be administered.  \nThe infusion bag is placed inside an insulated polyurethane container and packed in a \nshipping box.  The insulated container and the gel packs within are designed to maintain the \nappropriate transportation and storage temperature of Provenge until infusion.  Do not \nirradiate. \n\n•  The outer shipping box should be opened to verify the product and patient-specific labels \nlocated on the top of the insulated container.  Do not remove this insulated container from \nthe shipping box, or open the lid of the insulated container, until the patient is ready for \ninfusion. \n\n \nPreparing the infusion \nTake care to ensure aseptic handling when preparing the infusion.  \n \n\nWhat to check prior to infusion \n•  It must be ensured that the Final Product Disposition Notification form containing the \n\npatient identifiers, expiration date and time, and the disposition status (approved for infusion \nor rejected), has been received from the marketing authorisation holder. \n\n•  It must be ensured that the patient’s identity matches the essential unique patient \ninformation on the Provenge bag and on the Final Product Disposition form. \n\n•  Once the patient is prepared for infusion and the APPROVED Final Product Disposition \nNotification form has been received, the Provenge bag should be removed from the \ninsulated container and inspected for leaks, external damage, foreign particulate matter, or \nclumps/clots. \n\n•  Contents of the bag will be slightly cloudy, with a cream to pink colour.  Gently mix and \nre-suspend the contents of the bag, inspecting for clumps and clots.  Small clumps of \ncellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. \n\n•  If the Provenge bag leaks, is damaged, or if particles or clumps remain in the bag after \ngentle manual mixing, the product must not be used. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \nAdministration \n\n•  Infusion must begin prior to the expiration date and time indicated on the Final Product \nDisposition Notification form and bag label.  Do not initiate infusion of expired Provenge. \n\n•  Only one of the 2 spike ports should be used and should not be opened prior to \nadministration in order to avoid contamination. \n\n•  Provenge is infused over a period of approximately 60 minutes through a large bore needle \nappropriate for transfusion of red blood cells.  This peripheral delivery system is commonly \nused in clinical practice for the transfusion of blood components.  Do not use a cell filter \nfor infusion.  The entire volume of the infusion bag should be used. \n\n•  If the infusion of Provenge must be interrupted, it should not be resumed if the infusion bag \nhas been held at room temperature (25°C) for more than 3 hours.   \n\n \nAfter the infusion \n\n•  Upon completion of the infusion, the patient specific label on the infusion bag should be \nremoved and adhered to the patient file. \n\n•  Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \n \n7.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Provenge is and what it is used for \n \nProvenge is used to control your prostate cancer.  It consists of immune cells (part of your body’s \nnatural defense system) taken from your own blood (also called autologous immune cells).  These \nimmune cells are then mixed with an antigen (a protein, which is able to stimulate your immune \nsystem) at a specific manufacturing facility.  When given as a drip (infusion) into your vein, Provenge \nworks by teaching your immune cells to recognise and attack prostate cancer cells.  \n \nProvenge is used as treatment for prostate cancer that has spread outside of the prostate but not to the \nliver, lung or brain, and no longer responds to medicines that lower the levels of the male hormone \ntestosterone in patients who are not considered appropriate for treatment with chemotherapy.   \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Provenge  \n \nDo not use Provenge \nIf you are allergic (hypersensitive) to the active substances or any of the ingredients of this medicine \n(listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTell your doctor if you have any of the conditions listed below as you will have to be closely \nmonitored during and after your infusion: \n\n•  An infection which affects your whole body (e.g., sepsis, seen as high temperature, \nincreased heart rate or breathing) \n\n•  A history of stroke \n•  A heart condition including blocked blood vessels which could lead to a heart attack \n•  You are immunocompromised (your immune system’s ability to fight infections is reduced) \n\nor taking any immunosuppressant medicines (such as those used to treat or prevent organ \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n29 \n\nrejection and certain medicines used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s \ndisease, and ulcerative colitis) \n\n•  You are on a controlled sodium/potassium diet or you have reduced kidney function. \n \nYour doctor may decide that Provenge is not suitable for you due to one or more of these conditions. \n \nOn the first day of the infusion, Provenge may cause infusion-related reactions such as: \n\n•  high temperature, chills, breathing difficulties \n•  feeling or being sick (nausea and vomiting) \n•  tiredness \n•  increased heart rate, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, fainting. \n\n \nTo reduce these reactions your doctor may suggest that you take paracetamol and an antihistamine \nmedicine about 30 minutes before your treatment with Provenge. \n \nIf you have severe reactions during the infusion your doctor may either slow down the infusion or \nstop it.  You may also be given other medicines if needed.  Tell the doctor or nurse if you do not feel \nwell during the infusion. \n \nProvenge is manufactured specifically for you using your own blood and must not be used in anyone \nelse. \n \nProvenge undergoes several tests before use to show that it is sterile.  As it has to be given to you \nshortly after it has been manufactured, the final sterility results may not always be available before \nyou are given your infusion of Provenge.  If the final results show that your medicine was not sterile, \nyour doctor will be notified and you will be monitored closely for any signs of infection and will be \ntreated accordingly. \n \nWhen Provenge cannot be given \nIn some cases, you may be unable to receive a scheduled infusion of Provenge.  This may be due to a \nnumber of reasons, for example, if there is: \n\n•  a problem at the time your blood cells are taken for the manufacturing of Provenge. \n•  not enough of the right type of cells to manufacture the medicine. \n•  contamination of the product. \n•  a delay in Provenge reaching the clinic where you will be given your treatment. \n•  damage to the product when it arrives at the clinic; for example, the bag containing the \n\nproduct has leaked, or the cells have formed clumps that cannot be dispersed. \n \n\nIn such cases, if your doctor decides that the course of treatment should be continued, he or she will \narrange for another collection of your blood cells (leukapheresis) and the manufacturing process will \nbe repeated (see information on leukapheresis in section 3).  In clinical studies, about one quarter of \nthe patients required more than 3 leukapheresis procedures in order to receive 3 infusions of \nProvenge. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nProvenge is for use in adult men only.  It should not be given to children or adolescents under the age \nof 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Provenge \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.  \nThis includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. \n \nProvenge is designed to stimulate your immune system, and therefore it may not be appropriate to be \ntreated with Provenge if you are currently taking other treatments that could affect the ability of your \nimmune system to respond to Provenge e.g., immunosuppressant medicines such as those used to treat \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n30 \n\nor prevent organ rejection and certain medicines used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, \nCrohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis.  \n \nIf you need a vaccination whilst receiving Provenge, you should first discuss this with your doctor.  \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nProvenge is for use in men only.  The effects of Provenge on male fertility are not known at this time. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYou may feel tired, faint, or dizzy or have a headache or chills after receiving your Provenge infusion.  \nIf this happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines until you feel better. \n \nProvenge contains sodium and potassium \nThis medicine contains: \n\n•  approximately 800 mg sodium per infusion.  To be taken into consideration by patients with \nheart conditions or those on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n•  approximately 45 mg potassium per infusion.  To be taken into consideration by patients \nwith reduced kidney function or on a controlled potassium diet. \n\n \n \n3. How Provenge is given to you \n \nProvenge can only be administered by a doctor or nurse who has been trained in using this medicine.  \nPractical information for handling and administration of Provenge for the doctor or nurse can be \nfound at the end of this leaflet. \n \nAs Provenge is made from your own blood cells, your cells will be collected approximately 3 days \nbefore each scheduled infusion.  This procedure will take 3 to 4 hours (see section “Steps before \nProvenge treatment” below).  Your blood will be tested before it is collected (see section “Tests” \nbelow). \n \nSteps before Provenge treatment \n\n1. The first step in your Provenge treatment is to collect your blood cells in order to \nmanufacture your personal infusion of Provenge.  This involves a procedure called \nleukapheresis, which consists of extracting white blood cells from your blood, usually from \nthe veins in your arms.  A machine is used to take blood from one arm, extract the white \nblood cells and return the rest of the blood to you, usually in the other arm.  This procedure \nusually takes 3-4 hours.  You will have to have this procedure on at least 3 occasions \napproximately 3 days before each of your 3 Provenge infusion treatments. \n\n2. The second step is to send your collected cells to a special manufacturing centre where they \nare mixed with an antigen to make them ready for your infusion. \n\n \nTests \nBefore, or on the day, your blood cells are collected, a blood sample will be taken from you for a \ncomplete blood count (CBC) test.  This test will determine whether you have enough blood cells to \nallow the leukapheresis procedure to be safely carried out.  In addition, your blood will be tested for \nspecific viruses (for example HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B and hepatitis C).  This testing is a legal \nrequirement and is to ensure that your blood cells can be safely handled by the healthcare \nprofessionals involved in your treatment.  You may need to have further CBC tests during your \ntreatment in line with local or country-wide practices.  If you need more information on the testing of \nyour blood please ask your doctor or nurse. \n \nHow Provenge is given and duration of treatment \nYour doctor may suggest you take paracetamol and an antihistamine medicine about 30 minutes \nbefore your infusion to reduce the possible reactions to Provenge. \n \nYour Provenge treatment will be given by a drip (infusion) into one of your veins (intravenous use). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \nYou will receive a total of 3 infusions of Provenge at approximately 2 week intervals. \n \nThe first infusion of Provenge will be given approximately 3 days after the cell collection and will last \napproximately 1 hour (see also section 2 “Warnings and precautions”).  You will be monitored before \nand during the infusion.  If your infusion of Provenge has to be interrupted for any reason, your doctor \nwill not be able to restart the infusion if the medicine has been at room temperature for more than 3 \nhours. \n \nOnce the infusion is complete you will be observed and monitored for at least 30–60 minutes, after \nwhich, you may go home. \n \nYour treatment will involve at least 6 visits to the cell collection site and/or clinic.  You may need one \nor more additional visits in order to have your blood tested before your leukapheresis procedure \n(depending on the usual pratice in the clinic where you are having your treatment), or your blood may \nbe tested during your leukapheresis visits: \nVisit 1 – Blood cell collection (leukapheresis)  \nVisit 2 – Provenge infusion \nVisit 3 – Blood cell collection (leukapheresis) \nVisit 4 – Provenge infusion \nVisit 5 – Blood cell collection (leukapheresis)  \nVisit 6 – Provenge infusion \n \nYour doctor will give you a schedule for your cell collection and infusion appointments.  This will be \nadded to your Patient Alert Card that you should bring to each appointment. \n \nMissed treatment \nIt is very important that you arrive on time for your appointments.  If you miss an appointment and \nyou cannot be given your Provenge infusion, it will no longer be usable.  Your doctor will work with \nyou to schedule new appointments for cell collection and infusion. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects of Provenge \n \nLike all medicines, Provenge can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe most severe side effects are described below:  \n \nInfusion-related side effects \nDuring or within 24 hours of the infusion, you may develop very common symptoms such as chills, \nfever, tiredness, feeling weak, headache, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), muscle ache, \nand dizziness,.  Common symptoms include a fainting episode, bluish discoloration of the skin, lips \nand/or nail beds due to low levels of oxygen in the blood, wheezing, high or low blood pressure and \ndifficulty breathing. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you develop any of these symptoms, as the infusion may need to be \nslowed down or stopped.  You may also be given other medicines if needed. \n \nIf you experience any of the following side effects several days after the infusion, contact a doctor \nimmediately: \n\n•  shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, rash, or fever. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n32 \n\nInfection \nTell your doctor after your Provenge treament if you get any symptoms of an infection, for example, a \nfever or high temperature above 38°C, chills, a fast heartbeat, fast breathing, dizziness on standing up, \nconfusion or feeling/being sick. \n \nStroke \nContact a doctor immediately if you experience sudden vision loss in one eye, difficulty speaking, \nnumbness and/or weakness affecting one side of the body as any of these may be signs of a stroke. \n \nHeart attack \nContact a doctor immediately if you experience chest pain, pain in the left arm and/or shortness of \nbreath as any of these may be signs of a heart attack. \n \nOther side effects with Provenge include: \n \nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 patients): \n\n-  pain \n-  joint ache or pain (arthralgia) \n-  tingling, numbness or abnormal sensation (paraesthesia) around lips, in mouth, or in the \n\narms and/or legs during the leukapheresis procedure \n-  muscle spasms, chest pain, and low blood pressure during the leukapheresis procedure \n\n(caused by a medicine (citrate) used to prevent blood clotting). \n-  anaemia (decrease in number of red blood cells) due tothe leukapheresis procedure \n\n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 patients): \n\n-  flu-like illness \n-  abdominal pain \n-  tremor \n-  rash, including raised itchy rash (urticaria), or itching \n-  excessive sweating \n-  bacteria in the blood (bacteraemia) \n-  reduced sense of touch or sensation (hypoaesthesia) \n-  collapse of one of the bones in the spine (spinal cord compression) \n-  irregular or rapid heart rate \n-  stroke \n-  temporary symptoms of a stroke \n-  blood in the urine \n-  chest discomfort \n-  decrease of platelets in the blood due to the leukapheresis procedure \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 patients \n-  severe infection in the blood(sepsis) \n-  severe infection in the blood from a contaminated catheter (catheter sepsis) \n-  infection from a contaminated catheter (catheter-related infection) \n-  skin infection of the area where the infusion drip was inserted \n-  heart attack \n-  symptoms of a heart attack \n-  increase in a type of white blood cells called eosinophils \n-  infusion site reaction (a reaction of the skin area where the infusion drip was inserted) \n \n\nReporting side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

Additional CBC tests may be performed in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nHandling instructions \n \nBefore handling or administering Provenge \n\n•  Provenge is shipped directly to the medical facility where the infusion will be administered.  \nThe infusion bag is placed inside an insulated polyurethane container and packed in a \nshipping box.  The insulated container and the gel packs within are designed to maintain the \nappropriate transportation and storage temperature of Provenge until infusion.  Do not \nirradiate. \n\n•  The outer shipping box should be opened to verify the product and patient-specific labels \nlocated on the top of the insulated container.  Do not remove this insulated container from \nthe shipping box, or open the lid of the insulated container, until the patient is ready for \ninfusion. \n\n•  Provenge is prepared from human blood of the specific patient and is not tested for \ntransmissible infectious agents.  Patient leukapheresis material is tested for transmissible \ninfectious agents in line with applicable local requirements.  However, as Provenge is an \nautologous product, a positive test does not preclude the manufacture of the product.  \nTherefore, Provenge may carry the risk of transmitting infectious viruses (HIV 1 and 2, \nhepatitis B and C) to health care professionals handling the product.  Accordingly, \nhealthcare professionals should employ appropriate precautions when handling the \nleukapheresis material or Provenge. \n \n\nPreparing the infusion \n•  Take care to ensure aseptic handling when preparing the infusion. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWhat to check prior to infusion \n•  It must be ensured that the Final Product Disposition Notification form containing the \n\npatient identifiers, expiration date and time, and the disposition status (approved for infusion \nor rejected), has been received from the market authorisation holder. \n\n•  It must be ensured that the patient’s identity matches the essential unique patient \ninformation on the Provenge bag and the Final Product Disposition Notification form. \n\n•  Once the patient is prepared for infusion and the APPROVED Final Product Disposition \nNotification form has been received, the Provenge bag should be removed from the \ninsulated container and inspected for leaks, external damage, foreign particulate matter, or \nclumps/clots. \n\n•  Contents of the bag will be slightly cloudy, with a cream to pink colour.  Gently mix and re-\nsuspend the contents of the bag, inspecting for clumps and clots.  Small clumps of cellular \nmaterial should disperse with gentle manual mixing. \n\n•  If the Provenge bag leaks, is damaged, or if particles or clumps remain in the bag after \ngentle manual mixing, the product must not be used. \n\n \nAdministration \n\n•  Infusion must begin prior to the expiration date and time indicated on the Final Product \nDisposition Notification form and bag label.  Do not initiate infusion of expired Provenge.  \n\n•  Only one of the 2 spike ports should be used and should not be opened prior to \nadministration in order to avoid contamination. \n\n•  Provenge is infused over a period of approximately 60 minutes through a large bore needle \nappropriate for transfusion of red blood cells.  This peripheral delivery system is commonly \nused in clinical practice for the transfusion of blood components.  Do not use a cell filter \nfor infusion.  The entire volume of the infusion bag should be used. \n\n•  If the infusion of Provenge must be interrupted, it should not be resumed if the infusion bag \nhas been held at room temperature (25°C) for more than 3 hours. \n\n \nAfter the infusion \n\n•  Upon completion of the infusion, the patient specific label on the infusion bag should be \nremoved and adhered to the patient file. \n\n•  Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n\n \nIMPORTANT - Do not infuse Provenge if \n• You have not received the Final Product Disposition Notification form. \n• The Final Product Disposition Notification form is marked REJECTED. \n• The expiration date and time have passed. \n• The essential unique patient information on the infusion bag does not match that of the \n\nscheduled patient. \n• The product integrity has been breached in any way (the infusion bag is damaged, leaks, or \n\nparticles/clumps remain in the bag after gentle manual mixing). \n \nShelf life and special precautions for storage \nProvenge has a shelf life of 18 hours in the insulated container that is shipped to the medical facility \nwhere the infusion will be administered.  Store the bag in the insulated container to maintain the \ncorrect storage temperature (2°C–8°C) until infusion.  Do not refrigerate or freeze the container. \n \nAfter removal from the insulated container, Provenge should be used immediately.  If not used \nimmediately, in use storage times and conditions should not exceed 3 hours at room temperature \n(25°C). \n \nDisposal \nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
