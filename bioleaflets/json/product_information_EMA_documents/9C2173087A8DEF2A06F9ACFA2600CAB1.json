PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin for subcutaneous injection and should be administered zero to two \nminutes before the start of the meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal (see section 5.1).  \n \nLyumjev 100 units/mL is suitable for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and is used for \nboth the bolus and basal insulin requirement. \n \nThe initial dosage should take into account the type of diabetes, weight of the patient and their blood \nglucose levels.  \n \nThe early onset of action must be considered when prescribing Lyumjev (see section 5.1). Continued \nadjustment of the dose of Lyumjev should be based on the patient’s metabolic needs, blood glucose \nmonitoring results, and glycaemic control goal. Dose adjustments may be needed, when switching \nfrom another insulin, with changes in physical activity, changes in concomitant medicinal products, \nchanges in meal patterns (i.e., amount and type of food, timing of food intake), changes in renal or \nhepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n \nSwitching from another mealtime insulin medicinal product \n \nIf converting from another mealtime insulin to Lyumjev, the change can be done on a unit-to-unit \nbasis. The potency of insulin analogues, including Lyumjev, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of \nLyumjev corresponds to 1 international unit (IU) of human insulin or 1 unit of other fast-acting insulin \nanalogues.  \n \nMissed doses \n \nPatients who forget a mealtime dose should monitor their blood glucose level to decide if an insulin \ndose is needed, and to resume their usual dosing schedule at the next meal. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old)  \nThe safety and efficacy of Lyumjev has been established in elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years. Close \nglucose monitoring is recommended and the insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis \n(see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). The therapeutic experience in patients ≥ 75 years of age is limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. In patients with renal \nimpairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown. In patients with hepatic impairment, glucose \nmonitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Lyumjev in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPatients should be trained on proper use and injection technique before initiating Lyumjev. Patients \nshould be told to: \n• Always check insulin labels before administration. \n• Inspect Lyumjev visually before use and discard for particulate matter or discolouration. \n• Rotate injection or infusion sites to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. \n• Carry a spare or alternative administration method in case their delivery system breaks. \n \nSubcutaneous injection \n \nLyumjev should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arm, thigh or buttocks (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nLyumjev should generally be used in combination with an intermediate or long-acting insulin.  A \ndifferent injection site should be used if injecting at the same time as another insulin.  \n \nWhen injecting a blood vessel should not be entered.  \n \nDevices should be discarded if any part looks broken or damaged.  \n \nThe needle should be discarded after each injection.  \n \nLyumjev vials \nIf subcutaneous administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n \nThe syringe must have 100 units/mL markings. \n \nPatients using vials must never share needles or syringes. \n \nLyumjev cartridges \nLyumjev in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a Lilly reusable pen.  \n \nLyumjev cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not \nbeen established with other pens. \n \nThe instructions with each individual pen must be followed for loading the cartridge, attaching the \nneedle and administering the insulin injection. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by one patient only, even \nif the needle on the delivery device is changed. \n \nLyumjev KwikPens \nThe KwikPen and Junior KwikPen are only suitable for subcutaneous injections. \n \nLyumjev is available in two concentrations: Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen and Lyumjev \n200 units/mL KwikPen. See the separate SmPC for Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen. The KwikPen \ndelivers 1 - 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The Lyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen \ndelivers 0.5 - 30 units in steps of 0.5 units in a single injection. The number of insulin units is shown \nin the dose window of the pen regardless of concentration and no dose conversion should be done \nwhen transferring a patient to a new concentration or to a pen with a different dose step.  \n \nLyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen is suitable for patients who may benefit from finer insulin \ndose adjustments. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the instructions for use provided with the package leaflet. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only, even if the \nneedle is changed. \n \nCSII (insulin pump) \nUse a pump suitable for insulin infusion. Fill the pump reservoir from a Lyumjev 100 units/mL vial.  \n \nPatients using a pump should follow the instructions provided with the pump and infusion set.  \nUse the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump. \n \nWhen filling the pump reservoir avoid damaging it by using the correct needle length on the filling \nsystem. The infusion set (tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the instructions in \nthe product information supplied with the infusion set. \n \nA pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIntravenous use \n \nLyumjev 100 units/mL is available in vials if administration of intravenous injection is necessary. This \nmedicinal product must not be mixed with any other insulin or any other medicinal product except \nthose mentioned in section 6.6. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nIntravenous administration of Lyumjev 100 units/mL must be performed under medical supervision. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypoglycaemia. \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy. The timing of hypoglycaemia \nusually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Hypoglycaemia may \noccur earlier after an injection/infusion when compared to other mealtime insulins due to the earlier \nonset of action of Lyumjev (see section 5.1). \n \nHypoglycaemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over \ntime in the same individual. Severe hypoglycaemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, \nmay be life-threatening, or cause death. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycaemia may be less \npronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nThe use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic \nketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nPatients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and to get immediate \nhelp when ketoacidosis is suspected. \n \nInsulin requirements and dose adjustments \n \nChanges in insulin, insulin concentration, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect \nglycaemic control and predispose to hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. These changes should be \nmade cautiously under close medical supervision and the frequency of glucose monitoring should be \nincreased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic treatment \nmay be needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and dosage \nadjusted on an individual basis (see section 4.2). \n \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or \nchange their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nHyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis due to insulin pump device malfunction \n \nMalfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set can rapidly lead to hyperglycaemia and \nketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycaemia or ketosis is \nnecessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with Lyumjev may be required. \n \nThiazolidinediones (TZDs) used in combination with insulin \n \nTZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid \nretention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin and a TZD should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, consider discontinuation of \nthe TZD. \n \nHypersensitivity and allergic reactions \n \nSevere, life-threatening, generalised allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin medicinal \nproducts, including Lyumjev. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Lyumjev. \n \nMedication errors \n \nLyumjev should not be used by patients with visual impairment without help of a trained person. \n \nTo avoid medication errors between Lyumjev and other insulins, patients need to always check the \ninsulin label before each injection.  \n \nPatients should always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and a blocked needle. \nIn the event of a blocked needle it should be replaced with a new needle.   \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe following substances may reduce insulin requirement: Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral or \ninjectable), salicylates, sulphonamides, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n(MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blocking agents, or somatostatin analogues. \n \nThe following substances may increase insulin requirement: oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, \nthyroid hormones, danazol, sympathomimetic agents, diuretics, or growth hormone. \n \nAlcohol may increase or decrease the blood glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev. Consumption of \nlarge amounts of ethanol concomitantly with insulin use may lead to severe hypoglycaemia.  \n \nBeta-blockers may blunt the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nTZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin, and \nexacerbate heart failure (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of insulin lispro. Lyumjev can be used during pregnancy \nif clinically needed. \n \nIt is essential to maintain good control of an insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational) diabetes \npatient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase \nduring the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally return rapidly to \npre-pregnancy values. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are \npregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in \npregnant patients with diabetes.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLyumjev can be used during breast-feeding. Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require \nadjustments in insulin dose, diet or both. \n \nFertility \n \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is \nparticularly important in those patients who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (very common) (see  \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: \n< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 1.

The \nincidence of severe hypoglycaemia in the 26 week Phase 3 clinical studies was 5.5 % in patients with \ntype 1 diabetes mellitus and 0.9 % in patients with type 2 diabetes (see tables 2 and 3). \n \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include listlessness, confusion, \npalpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  \n \nThere were no clinically significant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia with administration \nof Lyumjev or the comparator (another medicinal product containing insulin lispro) across all studies. \nIn studies where Lyumjev and the comparator were administered at different times relative to meals, \nthere were no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia.    \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an injection/infusion of Lyumjev compared to other mealtime \ninsulins due to the earlier onset of action. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSevere, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, \nangioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including Lyumjev. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with other insulin therapy, patients may experience rash, redness, inflammation, pain, bruising or \nitching at the site of Lyumjev injection. These reactions are usually mild and usually disappear during \ncontinued treatment. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAdministration of insulin can cause formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of anti-drug \nantibodies did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of \nLyumjev. \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nLipodystrophy \n \nAdministration of insulin, including Lyumjev, may result in lipodystrophy [lipohypertrophy \n(enlargement or thickening of tissue), lipoatrophy (depression in the skin)] or cutaneous amyloidosis \n(lumps under the skin). Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area \nmay help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions. \n \nOedema  \n \nCases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic \ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nBased on results from clinical trials with insulin lispro in general, the frequency, type and severity of \nadverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not \nindicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. The safety information in \nvery elderly patients (≥ 75 years) or patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic \nimpairment is limited (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose causes hypoglycaemia with accompanying symptoms that include listlessness, confusion, \npalpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin lispro relative to food intake, energy \nexpenditure, or both. Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. More \nsevere episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon or \nconcentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary \nbecause hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal \npatterns, or exercise may be needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC code: A10AB04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe primary activity of Lyumjev is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin \nlispro, the active substance in Lyumjev, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. \nReceptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal \nmuscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, \nand enhance protein synthesis. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nLyumjev is a formulation of insulin lispro that contains citrate and treprostinil. Citrate increases local \nvascular permeability and treprostinil induces local vasodilation to achieve accelerated absorption of \ninsulin lispro. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEarly and late insulin action \n \nA glucose clamp study was conducted in 40 type 1 diabetes patients given Lyumjev and Humalog \nsubcutaneously as a single 15 unit dose. Results are provided in Figure 1. Lyumjev has been shown to \nbe equipotent to Humalog on a unit for unit basis but its effect is more rapid with a shorter duration of \naction. \n \n• Onset of action of Lyumjev was 20 minutes post dose, 11 minutes faster than Humalog. \n• During the first 30 minutes post dose, Lyumjev had a 3-fold greater glucose lowering effect \n\ncompared to Humalog. \n• Maximum glucose-lowering effect of Lyumjev occurred between 1 and 3 hours after injection. \n• The late insulin action, from 4 hours until the end of the glucose clamp, was 54 % lower with \n\nLyumjev than observed with Humalog. \n• The duration of action of Lyumjev was 5 hours, 44 minutes shorter than Humalog. \n• The total glucose infused during the clamp was comparable between Lyumjev and Humalog. \n \nFigure 1. Mean glucose infusion rate (GIR) in patients with type 1 diabetes after subcutaneous \ninjection of Lyumjev or Humalog (15 unit dose) \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSimilarly, a faster early insulin action and a reduced late insulin action was observed with Lyumjev in \ntype 2 diabetes patients. \n \nTotal and maximum glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev increased with dose within the therapeutic \ndose range. The early onset and total insulin action were similar when Lyumjev was administered in \nthe abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. \n \nPostprandial Glucose (PPG) Lowering \n \nLyumjev reduced the PPG during a standardized test meal over the complete 5 hour test meal period \n(change from premeal AUC(0-5h)) compared to Humalog.  \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n• In patients with type 1 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by \n32 % when given at the start of the meal and 18 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the \nmeal compared to Humalog. \n\n• In patients with type 2 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by \n26 % when given at the start of the meal and 24 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the \nmeal compared to Humalog. \n\n \nComparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL \n \nThe maximum and total glucose lowering were comparable for Lyumjev 200 units/mL or Lyumjev \n100 units/mL. No dose conversion is required if transferring a patient between the strengths. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Lyumjev was evaluated in 3 randomized, active controlled trials in adults.  \n \nType 1 Diabetes – Adults \n \nPRONTO-T1D was a 26 week, treat-to-target, trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in \n1222 patients on multiple daily injection therapy. Patients were randomized to either blinded \nmealtime Lyumjev, blinded mealtime Humalog, or open-label postmeal Lyumjev, all in combination \nwith either insulin glargine or insulin degludec . Mealtime Lyumjev or Humalog was injected 0 to \n2 minutes before the meal and postmeal Lyumjev was injected 20 minutes after the start of the meal. \n \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 2 and Figure 2. \n \n37.4 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev, 33.6 % of patients treated with mealtime Humalog \nand 25.6 % of patients treated with postmeal Lyumjev reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %. \n \nBasal, bolus and total insulin doses were similar among study arms at 26 weeks. \n \nFollowing the 26 week period, the two blinded treatment arms continued to 52 weeks. HbA1c was not \nstatistically significantly different between treatments at the 52 week endpoint. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nTable 2 Results from 26  week basal-bolus clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes  \n \n Mealtime Lyumjev \n\n+ basal insulin \nMealtime \n\nHumalog + \nbasal insulin \n\nPostmeal Lyumjev \n+ basal insulin \n\nNumber of randomized subjects (N) 451 442 329 \nHbA1c (%) \n Baseline  week 26  7.34  7.21 7.337.29 7.367.42 \n Change from baseline -0.13 -0.05 0.08 \n Treatment difference  -0.08 [-0.16, -0.00]C  0.13 [0.04, 0.22]D \nHbA1c (mmol/mol) \n Baseline  week 26 56.755.3 56.756.1 56.957.6 \n Change from baseline -1.4 -0.6 0.8 \n Treatment difference  -0.8 [-1.7, 0.00]C  1.4 [0.5, 2.4]D \n1 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mg/dL) A \n Baseline  week 26  77.3 46.4 71.5 74.3 76.387.5 \n Change from baseline  -28.6 -0.7 12.5 \n Treatment difference -27.9 [-35.3, -20.6]C,E  13.2 [5.0, 21.4]D \n1 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mmol/L) A \n Baseline  week 26  4.292.57 3.97 4.13 4.244.86 \n Change from baseline  -1.59 -0.04 0.70 \n Treatment difference -1.55[-1.96, -1.14]C,E  0.73 [0.28,1.19]D \n2 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mg/dL) A \n Baseline  week 26  112.772.7 101.6 103.9 108.0 97.2 \n Change from baseline  -34.7 -3.5 -10.2 \n Treatment difference -31.2 [-41.1, -21.2]C,E  -6.7 [-17.6, 4.3] D.   \n2 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mmol/L) A \n Baseline  week 26  6.264.04 5.645.77 5.995.40 \n Change from baseline  -1.93 -0.20 -0.56 \n Treatment difference -1.73 [-2.28, -1.18]C,E  -0.37 [-0.98, -0.24]D \nBody weight (Kg)    \n Baseline  week 26 77.377.9 77.378.2 77.678.1 \n Change from baseline  0.6 0.8 0.7 \n Treatment difference -0.2 [-0.6, 0.1]A  -0.1[-0.5, 0.3]D \nSevere hypoglycaemia B (% of patients) 5.5 % 5.7 % 4.6 % \n\nWeek 26 and change from baseline values are based on the least-squares means (adjusted means).  \nThe 95 % confidence interval is stated in ‘[ ]’.   \nA Meal test  \nB Severe hypoglycaemia is defined as episode requiring assistance of another person due to patient’s \nneurological impairment. \nC The difference is for mealtime Lyumjev – mealtime Humalog.  \nD The difference is for postmeal Lyumjev – mealtime Humalog. \nE Statistically significant in favour of mealtime Lyumjev. \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n \nFigure 2.

No overall \ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients. \n \nType 1 Diabetes – Adults. CSII \n \nPRONTO-Pump was a 12 week cross over design (2 periods of 6 weeks), double-blind, trial that \nevaluated the compatibility and safety of Lyumjev and Humalog with an external CSII System in \npatients who wore a continuous glucose monitor throughout the study. There were no statistically \nsignificant treatment difference in the rate or incidence of infusion set failures (n = 49). \n \nIn period 1 of the cross over study, Lyumjev had a numerically greater reduction in mean HbA1c than \nHumalog. Lyumjev reduction was -0.39 % [- 4.23 mmol/mol] from a baseline of 6.97 % \n[52.68 mmol/mol] and Humalog reduction was - 0.25 % [- 2.78 mmol/mol] from a baseline of 7.17 % \n[54.89 mmol/mol]. Lyumjev had a statistically significantly longer mean duration of time with glucose \nin target ranges 71 – 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L) within 1 and 2 hours after the start of breakfast \ncompared to Humalog. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAbsorption of insulin lispro was accelerated and the duration of exposure was shorter in healthy \nsubjects and patients with diabetes following injection of Lyumjev compared to Humalog. In patients \nwith type 1 diabetes: \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n• Insulin lispro appeared in circulation approximately 1 minute after injection of Lyumjev, which \nwas five minutes faster than Humalog . \n\n• Time to 50 % maximum concentration was 14 minutes shorter with Lyumjev compared to \nHumalog. \n\n• Following injection of Lyumjev, there was seven times more insulin lispro in circulation during \nthe first 15 minutes compared to Humalog and three times more insulin lispro during the first \n30 minutes compared to Humalog. \n\n• After administration of Lyumjev the time to maximum insulin lispro concentration was \nachieved at 57 minutes.  \n\n• Following injection of Lyumjev there was 41 % less insulin lispro in circulation after 3 hours \nfollowing injection compared to Humalog.  \n\n• The duration of insulin lispro exposure for Lyumjev was 60 minutes shorter compared to \nHumalog. \n\n• The total insulin lispro exposure (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.03 (0.973, 1.09) and maximum \nconcentration (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.06 (0.97, 1.16) were comparable between Lyumjev and \nHumalog. \n\n \nIn type 1 patients, the day-to-day variability [CV %] of Lyumjev was 13 % for total insulin lispro \nexposure (AUC, 0 - 10h) and 23 % for maximum insulin lispro concentration (Cmax).The absolute \nbioavailability of insulin lispro after subcutaneous administration of Lyumjev in the abdomen, upper \narm and thigh was approximately 65 %. The accelerated absorption of insulin lispro is maintained \nregardless of injection site (abdomen, upper arm and thigh). No exposure data are available following \ninjection in the buttocks.  \n \nMaximum concentration and time to maximum concentration were comparable for the abdomen and \nupper arm regions; time to maximum concentration was longer and maximum concentration lower for \nthe thigh. \n \nTotal insulin lispro exposure and maximum insulin lispro concentration increased proportionally with \nincreasing subcutaneous doses of Lyumjev within the dose range from 7U to 30U. \n \nCSII  \n \nThe absorption of insulin lispro was accelerated when Lyumjev was administered by CSII in patients \nwith type 1 diabetes.  \n• Time to reach 50 % maximum concentration was 14 minutes, 9 minutes shorter than for \n\nHumalog. \n• Following administration of Lyumjev, 1.5 times more insulin lispro was available during the \n\nfirst 30 minutes compared to Humalog. \n \nComparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL \n \nThe results of a study in healthy subjects demonstrated that Lyumjev 200 units/mL is bioequivalent to \nLyumjev 100 units/mL following administration of a single 15 unit dose for the area under serum \ninsulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and maximum insulin lispro \nconcentration. The accelerated insulin lispro absorption after administration of 200 units/mL was \nsimilar to that observed with Lyumjev 100 units/mL. No dose conversion is required if transferring a \npatient between the strengths.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV %]) volume of distribution of insulin lispro (Vd) \nwas 34 L (30 %) after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a 15 unit dose in \nhealthy subjects. \n \n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nElimination \n \nThe geometric mean (CV %) clearance of insulin lispro was 32 L/hour (22 %) and the median half-life \nof insulin lispro was 44 minutes after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a \n15 unit dose in healthy subjects. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIn adult subjects, age, gender, and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of \nLyumjev. No data are available on children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment is not known to impact the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development after exposure to insulin lispro. \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL contains 200 units insulin lispro*(equivalent to 6.9 mg).  \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 600 units of insulin lispro in 3 mL solution. \n \nEach KwikPen delivers 1 - 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. \n \n* produced in E.coli by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of diabetes mellitus in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin for subcutaneous injection and should be administered zero to two \nminutes before the start of the meal, with the option to administer up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal (see section 5.1). \n \nThe initial dosage should take into account the type of diabetes, weight of the patient and their blood \nglucose levels.  \n \nThe early onset of action must be considered when prescribing Lyumjev (see section 5.1). Continued \nadjustment of the dose of Lyumjev should be based on the patient’s metabolic needs, blood glucose \nmonitoring results, and glycaemic control goal. Dose adjustments may be needed, when switching \nfrom another insulin, with changes in physical activity, changes in concomitant medicinal products, \nchanges in meal patterns (i.e., amount and type of food, timing of food intake), changes in renal or \nhepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nSwitching from another mealtime insulin medicinal product \n \nIf converting from another mealtime insulin to Lyumjev, the change can be done on a unit-to-unit \nbasis. The potency of insulin analogues, including Lyumjev, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of \nLyumjev corresponds to 1 international unit (IU) of human insulin or 1 unit of other fast-acting insulin \nanalogues.  \n \nMissed doses \n \nPatients who forget a mealtime dose should monitor their blood glucose level to decide if an insulin \ndose is needed, and to resume their usual dosing schedule at the next meal. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (≥ 65 years old)  \nThe safety and efficacy of Lyumjev has been established in elderly patients aged 65 to 75 years. Close \nglucose monitoring is recommended and the insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis \n(see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). The therapeutic experience in patients ≥ 75 years of age is limited. \n \nRenal impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. In patients with renal \nimpairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown. In patients with hepatic impairment, glucose \nmonitoring should be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Lyumjev in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nPatients should be trained on proper use and injection technique before initiating Lyumjev. Patients \nshould be told to: \n• Always check insulin labels before administration. \n• Inspect Lyumjev visually before use and discard for particulate matter or discolouration. \n• Rotate injection sites to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. \n• Ensure when injecting that a blood vessel has not been entered.  \n• Discard the needle after each injection  \n• Discard devices if any part looks broken or damaged.  \n• Carry a spare or alternative administration method in case their delivery system breaks. \n \nLyumjev should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arm, thigh or buttocks (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nLyumjev should generally be used in combination with an intermediate or long-acting insulin. A \ndifferent injection site should be used if injecting at the same time as another insulin.  \n \nThe Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. \n \nLyumjev 200 units/mL should not be administered using a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion \n(CSII) pump. \n \nLyumjev 200 units/mL should not be administered intravenously. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \nLyumjev is available in two concentrations: Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen and Lyumjev \n100 units/mL KwikPen. See the separate SmPC for Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen. The KwikPen \ndelivers 1 - 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The number of insulin units is shown in the \ndose window of the pen regardless of concentration and no dose conversion should be done when \ntransferring a patient to a new concentration or to a pen with a different dose step.  \n \nFor detailed user instructions, please refer to the instructions for use provided with the package leaflet. \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only, even if the \nneedle is changed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypoglycaemia. \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy. The timing of hypoglycaemia \nusually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Hypoglycaemia may \noccur earlier after an injection when compared to other mealtime insulins due to the earlier onset of \naction of Lyumjev (see section  5.1). \n \nHypoglycaemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over \ntime in the same individual. Severe hypoglycaemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, \nmay be life-threatening, or cause death. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycaemia may be less \npronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nThe use of inadequate doses or discontinuation of treatment, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic \nketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal. \n \nPatients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and to get immediate \nhelp when ketoacidosis is suspected. \n \nInsulin requirements and dose adjustments \n \nChanges in insulin, insulin concentration, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect \nglycaemic control and predispose to hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. These changes should be \nmade cautiously under close medical supervision and the frequency of glucose monitoring should be \nincreased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic treatment \nmay be needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nIn patients with renal or hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and dosage \nadjusted on an individual basis (see section 4.2). \n \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \n \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or \nchange their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. \n \nThiazolidinediones (TZDs) used in combination with insulin \n \nTZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid \nretention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin and a TZD should be \nobserved for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, consider discontinuation of \nthe TZD. \n \nHypersensitivity and allergic reactions \n \nSevere, life-threatening, generalised allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin medicinal \nproducts, including Lyumjev. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Lyumjev. \n \nMedication errors \n \nLyumjev should not be used by patients with visual impairment without help of a trained person. \n \nTo avoid medication errors between Lyumjev and other insulins, patients need to always check the \ninsulin label before each injection. \n \nDo not transfer insulin from the Lyumjev Pen 200 units/mL to a syringe. The markings on the insulin \nsyringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdose and severe hypoglycaemia. \n \nPatients should always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and a blocked needle. \nIn the event of a blocked needle it should be replaced with a new needle.   \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e., essentially \n“sodium-free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe following substances may reduce insulin requirement: Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral or \ninjectable), salicylates, sulphonamides, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blocking agents, or somatostatin analogues. \n \nThe following substances may increase insulin requirement: oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, \nthyroid hormones, danazol, sympathomimetic agents, diuretics, or growth hormone. \n \nAlcohol may increase or decrease the blood glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev. Consumption of \nlarge amounts of ethanol concomitantly with insulin use may lead to severe hypoglycaemia. \n \nBeta-blockers may blunt the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. \n \nTZDs can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin, and \nexacerbate heart failure (see section 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no \nmalformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of insulin lispro. Lyumjev can be used during pregnancy \nif clinically needed. \n \nIt is essential to maintain good control of an insulin-treated (insulin-dependent or gestational) diabetes \npatient throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase \nduring the second and third trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements normally return rapidly to \npre-pregnancy values. Patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are \npregnant or are contemplating pregnancy. Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in \npregnant patients with diabetes.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nLyumjev can be used during breast-feeding. Patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require \nadjustments in insulin dose, diet or both. \n \nFertility \n \nInsulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThe patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may \nconstitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using \nmachinery). \n \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving, this is \nparticularly important in those patients who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of \nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be \nconsidered in these circumstances. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (very common) (see \nsections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). \n \nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical trials are listed below as MedDRA preferred \nterm by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000; very rare: \n< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nTable 1. Adverse reactions  \n \n\nMedDRA System \nOrgan Class Very common Common Uncommon \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nHypoglycaemia   \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy \nRash \nPruritus \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Injection site \nreactions \n\nOedema \n\n Allergic \nreactions* \n\n \n\n*See section 4.8 Description of selected adverse events \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHypoglycaemia \n \nHypoglycaemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin The \nincidence of severe hypoglycaemia in the 26 week Phase 3 clinical studies was 5.5 % in patients with \ntype 1 diabetes mellitus and 0.9 % in patients with type 2 diabetes (see tables  2 and 3). \nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include listlessness, confusion, \npalpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  \n \nThere were no clinically significant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia with administration \nof Lyumjev or the comparator (another medicinal product containing insulin lispro) across all studies. \nIn studies where Lyumjev and the comparator were administered at different times relative to meals, \nthere were no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of hypoglycaemia.    \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur earlier after an injection of Lyumjev compared to other mealtime insulins \ndue to the earlier onset of action. \n \nAllergic reactions \n \nSevere, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, \nangioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including Lyumjev. \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nAs with other insulin therapy, patients may experience rash, redness, inflammation, pain, bruising or \nitching at the site of Lyumjev injection. These reactions are usually mild and usually disappear during \ncontinued treatment. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAdministration of insulin can cause formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of anti-drug \nantibodies did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of \nLyumjev. \n \nLipodystrophy \n \nAdministration of insulin, including Lyumjev, may result in lipodystrophy [lipohypertrophy \n(enlargement or thickening of tissue), lipoatrophy (depression in the skin)]  or cutaneous amyloidosis \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n(lumps under the skin). Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area \nmay help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions. \n \nOedema  \n \nCases of oedema have been reported with insulin therapy, particularly if previous poor metabolic \ncontrol is improved by intensified insulin therapy. \n \nSpecial populations  \n \nBased on results from clinical trials with insulin lispro in general, the frequency, type and severity of \nadverse reactions observed in elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not \nindicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. The safety information in \nvery elderly patients (≥ 75 years) or patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic \nimpairment is limited (see section 5.1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose causes hypoglycaemia with accompanying symptoms that include listlessness, confusion, \npalpitations, sweating, vomiting, and headache.  \n \nHypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin lispro relative to food intake, energy \nexpenditure, or both. Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. More \nsevere episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon or \nconcentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary \nbecause hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal \npatterns, or exercise may be needed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \nATC code: A10AB04. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe primary activity of Lyumjev is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin \nlispro, the active substance in Lyumjev, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. \nReceptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal \nmuscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, \nand enhance protein synthesis. \n \nLyumjev is a formulation of insulin lispro that contains citrate and treprostinil. Citrate increases local \nvascular permeability and treprostinil induces local vasodilation to achieve accelerated absorption of \ninsulin lispro. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEarly and late insulin action \n \nA glucose clamp study was conducted in 40 type 1 diabetes patients given Lyumjev and Humalog \nsubcutaneously as a single 15 unit dose. Results are provided in Figure 1. Lyumjev has been shown to \nbe equipotent to Humalog on a unit for unit basis but its effect is more rapid with a shorter duration of \naction. \n \n• Onset of action of Lyumjev was 20 minutes post dose, 11 minutes faster than Humalog. \n• During the first 30 minutes post dose, Lyumjev had a 3-fold greater glucose lowering effect \n\ncompared to Humalog. \n• Maximum glucose-lowering effect of Lyumjev occurred between 1 and 3 hours after injection. \n• The late insulin action, from 4 hours until the end of the glucose clamp, was 54 % lower with \n\nLyumjev than observed with Humalog. \n• The duration of action of Lyumjev was 5 hours, 44 minutes shorter than Humalog. \n• The total glucose infused during the clamp was comparable between Lyumjev and Humalog. \n \nFigure 1. Mean glucose infusion rate (GIR) in patients with type 1 diabetes after subcutaneous \ninjection of Lyumjev or Humalog (15 unit dose) \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSimilarly, a faster early insulin action and a reduced late insulin action was observed with Lyumjev in \ntype 2 diabetes patients. \n \nTotal and maximum glucose lowering effect of Lyumjev increased with dose within the therapeutic \ndose range. The early onset and total insulin action were similar when Lyumjev was administered in \nthe abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. \n \nPostprandial Glucose (PPG) Lowering \n \nLyumjev reduced the PPG during a standardized test meal over the complete 5 hour test meal period \n(change from premeal AUC(0-5h)) compared to Humalog. \n \n• In patients with type 1 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by \n\n32 % when given at the start of the meal and 18 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the \nmeal compared to Humalog. \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n• In patients with type 2 diabetes, Lyumjev reduced the PPG during the 5 hour test meal period by \n26 % when given at the start of the meal and 24 % when given 20 minutes after the start of the \nmeal compared to Humalog. \n\n \nComparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL \n \nThe maximum and total glucose lowering were comparable for Lyumjev 200 units/mL or Lyumjev \n100 units/mL No dose conversion is required if transferring a patient between the strengths. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Lyumjev was evaluated in 2 randomized, active controlled trials in adults.  \n \nType 1 Diabetes – Adults \n \nPRONTO-T1D was a 26 week, treat-to-target, trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in \n1222 patients on multiple daily injection therapy. Patients were randomized to either blinded \nmealtime Lyumjev, blinded mealtime Humalog , or open-label postmeal Lyumjev , all in combination \nwith either insulin glargine  or insulin degludec.Mealtime Lyumjev or Humalog was injected 0 to \n2 minutes before the meal and postmeal Lyumjev was injected 20 minutes after the start of the meal. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 2 and Figure 2. \n \n37.4 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev, 33.6 % of patients treated with mealtime Humalog \nand 25.6 % of patients treated with postmeal Lyumjev reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %. \n \nBasal, bolus and total insulin doses were similar among study arms at 26 weeks. \n \nFollowing the 26 week period, the two blinded treatment arms continued to 52 weeks. HbA1c was not \nstatistically significantly different between treatments at the 52 week endpoint. \n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nTable 2 Results from 26 week basal-bolus clinical trial in patients with type 1 diabetes  \n \n Mealtime Lyumjev \n\n+ basal insulin \nMealtime \n\nHumalog + \nbasal insulin \n\nPostmeal Lyumjev \n+ basal insulin \n\nNumber of randomized subjects (N) 451 442 329 \nHbA1c (%) \n Baseline  week 26  7.34  7.21 7.337.29 7.367.42 \n Change from baseline -0.13 -0.05 0.08 \n Treatment difference  -0.08 [-0.16, -0.00]C  0.13 [0.04, 0.22]D \nHbA1c (mmol/mol) \n Baseline  week 26 56.755.3 56.756.1 56.957.6 \n Change from baseline -1.4 -0.6 0.8 \n Treatment difference  -0.8 [-1.7, 0.00]C  1.4 [0.5, 2.4]D \n1 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mg/dL) A \n Baseline  week 26  77.3 46.4 71.5 74.3 76.387.5 \n Change from baseline  -28.6 -0.7 12.5 \n Treatment difference -27.9 [-35.3, -20.6]C,E  13.2 [5.0, 21.4]D \n1 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mmol/L) A \n Baseline  week 26  4.292.57 3.97 4.13 4.244.86 \n Change from baseline  -1.59 -0.04 0.70 \n Treatment difference -1.55[-1.96, -1.14]C,E  0.73 [0.28,1.19]D \n2 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mg/dL) A \n Baseline  week 26  112.772.7 101.6 103.9 108.0 97.2 \n Change from baseline  -34.7 -3.5 -10.2 \n Treatment difference -31.2 [-41.1, -21.2]C,E  -6.7 [-17.6, 4.3] D.   \n2 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mmol/L) A \n Baseline  week 26  6.264.04 5.645.77 5.995.40 \n Change from baseline  -1.93 -0.20 -0.56 \n Treatment difference -1.73 [-2.28, -1.18]C,E  -0.37 [-0.98, -0.24]D \nBody weight (Kg)    \n Baseline  week 26 77.377.9 77.378.2 77.678.1 \n Change from baseline  0.6 0.8 0.7 \n Treatment difference -0.2 [-0.6, 0.1]A  -0.1[-0.5, 0.3]D \nSevere hypoglycaemia B (% of patients) 5.5 % 5.7 % 4.6 % \n\nWeek 26 and change from baseline values are based on the least-squares means (adjusted means).  \nThe 95 % confidence interval is stated in ‘[ ]’.   \nA Meal test  \nB Severe hypoglycaemia is defined as episode requiring assistance of another person due to patient’s \nneurological impairment. \nC The difference is for mealtime Lyumjev – mealtime Humalog.  \nD The difference is for postmeal Lyumjev – mealtime Humalog. \nE Statistically significant in favour of mealtime Lyumjev. \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \nFigure 2.

Patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev reported \nstatistically significantly longer time in range (6 am to midnight) with 603 minutes in range, (3.9 to \n10 mmol/L, 71 – 180 mg/dL), and 396 minutes in range (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L, 71 to 140  mg/dL), 44 and \n41 minutes longer than Humalog patients respectively.  \n \nType 2 Diabetes – Adults \n \nPRONTO-T2D was a 26 week, treat-to-target trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lyumjev in \n673 patients randomized to either blinded mealtime Lyumjev or to blinded mealtime Humalog, both \nin combination with a basal insulin (insulin glargine or insulin degludec) in a basal-bolus regimen. . \nMealtime Lyumjev or mealtime Humalog was injected 0 - 2 minutes before the meal. \nEfficacy results are provided in Table 3 and Figure 3. \n \n58.2 % of patients treated with mealtime Lyumjev and 52.5 % of patients treated with mealtime \nHumalog reached a target HbA1c of < 7 %.  \n \nBasal, bolus and total insulin doses were similar among study arms at the end of the trial.  \n \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nTable 3 Results from 26 week basal-bolus clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes  \n \n Mealtime Lyumjev \n\n+ basal insulin \nMealtime Humalog \n\n+ basal insulin \n\nNumber of randomized subjects (N) 336 337 \nHbA1c (%) \n Baseline  week 26 7.286.92 7.316.86 \n Change from baseline -0.38 -0.43 \n Treatment difference  0.06 [-0.05, 0.16]  \nHbA1c (mmol/mol) \n Baseline  week 26 56.052.1 56.451.5 \n Change from baseline -4.1 -4.7 \n Treatment difference  0.6 [-0.6, 1.8]  \n1 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mg/dL)A \n\n Baseline  week 26 76.663.1 77.174.9 \n Change from baseline  -13.8 -2.0 \n Treatment difference -11.8 [-18.1, -5.5]C \n\n1 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mmol/L)A   \n Baseline  week 26 4.253.50 4.284.16 \n Change from baseline  -0.77 -0.11 \n Treatment difference -0.66 [-1.01, -0.30]C \n2 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mg/dL)A \n Baseline  week 26 99.380.4 99.697.8 \n Change from baseline  -19.0 -1.6 \n Treatment difference -17.4 [-25.3, -9.5]C \n2 hour postprandial glucose excursion (mmol/L)A \n Baseline  week 26 5.514.47 5.535.43 \n Change from baseline  -1.06 -0.09 \n Treatment difference -0.96 [-1.41, -0.52]C \nBody weight (Kg)   \n Baseline  week 26 89.891.3 90.0 91.6 \n Change from baseline  1.4 1.7 \n Treatment difference -0.2 [-0.7, 0.3] \nSevere hypoglycaemia (% of patients)B 0.9 % 1.8 % \n\nWeek 26 and change from baseline values are based on the least-squares means (adjusted means).  \nThe 95 % confidence interval is stated in ‘[ ]’.

Time course of blood glucose excursion during mixed-meal tolerance test at week 26 in \npatients with type 2 diabetes \n \n\n \n \n\nPPG = Postprandial glucose \nLyumjev and Humalog administered at mealtime \nData are LSM (SE), *p < 0.05  \n \nElderly  \n \nIn the two 26 week clinical studies, 187 of 1,116 (17 %) Lyumjev treated patients with type 1 diabetes \nor type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age and 18 of 1,116 (2 %) were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall \ndifferences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nAbsorption of insulin lispro was accelerated and the duration of exposure was shorter in healthy \nsubjects and patients with diabetes following injection of Lyumjev compared to Humalog. In patients \nwith type 1 diabetes: \n• Insulin lispro appeared in circulation approximately 1 minute after injection of Lyumjev, which \n\nwas five minutes faster than Humalog . \n• Time to 50 % maximum concentration was 14 minutes shorter with Lyumjev compared to \n\nHumalog. \n• Following injection of Lyumjev, there was seven times more insulin lispro in circulation during \n\nthe first 15 minutes compared to Humalog and three times more insulin lispro during the first \n30 minutes compared to Humalog. \n\n• After administration of Lyumjev the time to maximum insulin lispro concentration was \nachieved at 57 minutes.  \n\n• Following injection of Lyumjev there was 41 % less insulin lispro in circulation after 3 hours \nfollowing injection compared to Humalog.  \n\n• The duration of insulin lispro exposure for Lyumjev was 60 minutes shorter compared to \nHumalog. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n• The total insulin lispro exposure (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.03 (0.973, 1.09) and maximum \nconcentration (ratio and 95 % CI of 1.06 (0.97, 1.16) were comparable between Lyumjev and \nHumalog. \n\n \nIn type 1 patients, the day-to-day variability [CV %] of Lyumjev was 13 % for total insulin lispro \nexposure (AUC, 0 - 10h) and 23 % for maximum insulin lispro concentration (Cmax).The absolute \nbioavailability of insulin lispro after subcutaneous administration of Lyumjev in the abdomen, upper \narm and thigh was approximately 65 %. The accelerated absorption of insulin lispro is maintained \nregardless of injection site (abdomen, upper arm and thigh). No exposure data are available following \ninjection in the buttocks.  \n \nMaximum concentration and time to maximum concentration were comparable for the abdomen and \nupper arm regions; time to maximum concentration was longer and maximum concentration lower for \nthe thigh. \n \nTotal insulin lispro exposure and maximum insulin lispro concentration increased proportionally with \nincreasing subcutaneous doses of Lyumjev within the dose range from 7U to 30U. \n \nComparison of Lyumjev 200 units/mL and Lyumjev 100 units/mL \n \nThe results of a study in healthy subjects demonstrated that Lyumjev 200 units/mL is bioequivalent to \nLyumjev 100 units/mL following administration of a single 15 unit dose for the area under serum \ninsulin lispro concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and maximum insulin lispro \nconcentration. The accelerated insulin lispro absorption after administration of 200 units/mL was \nsimilar to that observed with Lyumjev 100 units/mL. No dose conversion is required if transferring a \npatient between the strengths.  \n \nDistribution \n \nThe geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV %]) volume of distribution of insulin lispro (Vd) \nwas 34 L (30 %) after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a 15 unit dose in \nhealthy subjects. \n \nElimination \n \nThe geometric mean (CV %) clearance of insulin lispro was 32 L/hour (22 %) and the median half-life \nof insulin lispro was 44 minutes after intravenous administration of Lyumjev as a bolus injection of a \n15 unit dose in healthy subjects. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nIn adult subjects, age, gender, and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of \nLyumjev. No data are available on children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nPatients with renal and hepatic impairment \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment is not known to impact the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development after exposure to insulin lispro. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \nLyumjev 100 units/ml solution for injection in vial \n\ninsulin lispro \n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Lyumjev is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev \n3. How to use Lyumjev \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lyumjev \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lyumjev is and what it is used for  \n\n \nLyumjev 100 units/ml solution for injection in vial contains the active ingredient insulin lispro. \nLyumjev is used to treat diabetes in adults. It is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other \nmedicine containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin \nlispro into the body. \n \nDiabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin \neffectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin \nmedicine that is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of \ndiabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. \n \nTreatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from \nyour diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up \nto 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not \nchange your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev  \n \nDo NOT use Lyumjev \n• if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you \n\nhow to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you take more Lyumjev than you \nneed”). \n\n• if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6).  \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. \n \nIf you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. \n \n• Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  \nLow blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  \nLyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia \noccurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia \nor have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar \nlevels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may \nnot feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later \nin this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. \n\n \nYou must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. \nYou must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. \nMaking changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  \nIt may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood \nsugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicine.  \n \n• High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   \nStopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic \nketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common \nproblems of diabetes”. \n \n• If you are using an insulin pump and it stops working you will need to fix the problem \n\nimmediately as this can lead to high blood sugar. You may need to take an injection of Lyumjev \nusing an insulin pen or a syringe if your pump stops working. \n\n• If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicine called \nthiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you \nget signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). \n\n• If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using \nthis medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. \n\n• Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from \nyour pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. \n\n• Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you \ncan then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side \neffects”. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a \nneedle is blocked replace it with a new needle. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this \nmedicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Lyumjev \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange. \n \nYour blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   \n \n• other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \n• sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\n• acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) \n• some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) \n• some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for \n\nsome heart problems or high blood pressure) \n• angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) \n• somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving \n\ntoo much growth hormone) \n \nYour blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n \n• danazol (for endometriosis) \n• the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) \n• thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) \n• human growth hormone  (for growth hormone deficiency) \n• diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  \n• sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  \n• corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) \n \nBeta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the \nwarning signs of low blood sugar.  \n \nLyumjev with alcohol \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you \nneed usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. \nAfter you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed \nbefore your pregnancy.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, \nyou may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: \n• frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n• reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nLyumjev contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Lyumjev \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \ntold you. Check with them if you are not sure.  \n \nThey will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will \nalso tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  \n \nYou should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \nIf you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to make your injections.  \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject \nthem separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nWhen to inject Lyumjev \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two \nbefore the meal; you also have the option to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  \n \nHow much insulin to use \nYour doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  \n• How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. \n• How and when to check your blood sugar level.  \n• How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. \n• What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are \n\nusing other medicines. \n• If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This \n\nmight just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n \nDo not use Lyumjev \n• If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. \n\nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n• If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). \n• If the plastic cap of the vial is damaged, do not use.  \n \nWhere to inject Lyumjev \n• Inject Lyumjev under the skin (subcutaneous injection). \n• Do not inject yourself directly into a vein. Only your physician can administer Lyumjev by the \n\nintravenous use. He will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are \nill and your sugar levels are too high. \n\n• Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places you \ninject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen), as you have been taught.  \n\n• If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. \n \nHow to inject Lyumjev from a vial \n• First wash your hands. \n• Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Clean the rubber \n\nstopper on the vial, but do not remove the stopper. \n• Use a new, sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of \n\nLyumjev you want. Your doctor, nurse or clinic will tell you how to do this. Do not share your \nneedles and syringes. \n\n• Inject under the skin, as you were taught. After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 \nseconds to make sure you receive the full dose.   \n\n \nUsing Lyumjev in an insulin pump  \n• Only certain insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse Lyumjev.  \n• Carefully follow the instructions supplied with your infusion pump. \n• Be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump. It is important to use the correct \n\nneedle length on the filling system to avoid damaging the pump. \n• Change the infusion set (tubing and needle) according to the instructions supplied with the \n\ninfusion set.  \n• If repeated or severe low blood sugar levels occur, tell your doctor or nurse. \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n• A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in sugar levels. \nIf you think Lyumjev is not flowing, follow the pump instructions and if appropriate, notify \nyour doctor or nurse.  \n\n• You may need to take an injection of Lyumjev if your pump does not work properly. \n \nIf you take more Lyumjev than you need \nIf you inject too much Lyumjev, a low blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar. \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or \ndrink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you \nand have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check \nyour blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. \n \nIf you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, \nhave difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. \nThis can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If \nglucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to \ntell you about glucagon. \n \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \n \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical \nhelp straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nIf you forget to use Lyumjev \nIf you forget to use your insulin or you take less than you need, your blood sugar may get too high \n(hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your \nusual dosing schedule at your next meal. \n \nIf you stop using Lyumjev \nDo not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you take less Lyumjev than you \nneed, a high blood sugar may occur. \n \nIf high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4 ).  \n \nThree simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n• Always keep spare syringes and a spare vial of Lyumjev. \n• Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n• Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 \nunder ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need’. \n \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\nAllergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may \ninclude the following symptoms: \n \n\n• rash over the whole body  \n• difficulty in breathing  \n• wheezing \n\n• blood pressure dropping  \n• heart beating fast  \n• sweating \n\n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the \ningredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight \naway. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon  \nInjection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the \ninsulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop \nLyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nThere are several skin changes that can happen if you inject insulin too often at the same place called \nlipodystrophy which is where skin can shrink (lipoatrophy), thicken (lipohypertrophy) or get lumps \nunder the skin caused by a build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). Tell your \ndoctor if you get lipodystrophy at the injection site, rash or very itchy skin. Change the injection site \nwith each injection to help prevent skin changes. \n \nOther potential side effects \nSwelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema), particularly at the start of insulin therapy \nor during a change in your diabetes medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nLow blood sugar  \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n• you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; \n• you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n• you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n• you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n• there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble \n\nwith your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \nSee section ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need.’ \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n• tiredness \n• rapid heart beat \n• nervousness or shakiness \n• feeling sick \n• headache \n• cold sweat \n \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\nIf you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too \nhigh. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n• not taking your insulin; \n• using less insulin than your body needs;   \n• an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or \n• fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nThe early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  \n• being very thirsty  \n• headache  \n• feeling sleepy \n• urinating more often \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: \n• nausea and/or vomiting \n• abdominal pain \n• rapid pulse \n• heavy breathing \n• moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for \n\nenergy instead of glucose. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. \nSee section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Lyumjev \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nDo not freeze.  \nKeep in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nBefore first use \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C).  \n \nAfter first use  \nDo not store above 30 °C. \nDiscard after 28 days even if some of the solution remains. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Lyumjev is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev \n3. How to use Lyumjev \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lyumjev \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lyumjev is and what it is used for \n \nLyumjev 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge contains the active ingredient insulin lispro. \nLyumjev is used to treat diabetes in adults. It is a mealtime insulin that works more quickly than other \nmedicine containing insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up absorption of insulin \nlispro into the body. \n \nDiabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin \neffectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin \nmedicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of \ndiabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. \n \nTreatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from \nyour diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up \nto 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not \nchange your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev  \n \nDo NOT use Lyumjev \n• if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you \n\nhow to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you take more Lyumjev than you \nneed”). \n\n• if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. \n \nIf you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. \n \n• Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  \nLow blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  \nLyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia \noccurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia \nor have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar \nlevels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may \nnot feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later \nin this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. \n\n \nYou must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. \nYou must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. \nMaking changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  \nIt may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood \nsugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicine.  \n \n• High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   \nStopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic \nketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common \nproblems of diabetes”. \n \n• If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicinecalled \n\nthiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you \nget signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). \n\n• If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using \nthis medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. \n\n• Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from \nyour pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use.  \n\n• Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you \ncan then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side \neffects”. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a \nneedle is blocked replace it with a new needle. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this \nmedicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Lyumjev \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange. \n \nYour blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   \n \n• other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \n• sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) \n• acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) \n• some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) \n• some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for \n\nsome heart problems or high blood pressure) \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n• angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) \n• somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving \n\ntoo much growth hormone) \n \nYour blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n \n• danazol (for endometriosis)  \n• the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) \n• thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) \n• human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) \n• diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  \n• sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  \n• corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) \n\n \nBeta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the \nwarning signs of low blood sugar. \n \nLyumjev with alcohol \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n  \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you \nneed usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. \nAfter you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed \nbefore your pregnancy.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, \nyou may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: \n• frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n• reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nLyumjev contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Lyumjev \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \ntold you. Check with them if you are not sure.  \n \nThey will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will \nalso tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each cartridge must be used by you only, even if the \nneedle on the pen is changed. \n \nYou should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. \n \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nIf you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to make your injections. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject \nthem separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nWhen to inject Lyumjev \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two \nbefore the meal; you also have the option to inject  up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  \n \nHow much insulin to use \nYour doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  \n• How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. \n• How and when to check your blood sugar level.  \n• How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. \n• What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are \n\nusing other medicines. \n• If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This \n\nmight just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n \nDo not use Lyumjev \n• If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. \n\nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n• If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). \n• If the cartridge is damaged in any way, do not use.  \n \nGetting the pen ready to use \n• First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge. \n• You must only use Lyumjev cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that \n\nLyumjev or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The 3 ml \ncartridge only fits the 3 ml pen. \n\n• Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen.  \n• Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). \n• Prime every time. The pen must be primed until you see insulin at the needle tip before each \n\ninjection to make sure the pen is ready to dose. If you do not prime, you may get the wrong \ndose. \n \n\nInjecting Lyumjev \n• Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  \n• Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  \n• After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full \n\ndose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places \nyou inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen). \n\n• If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much \nyou still need to take. Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. \n\n• If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. \n• Do not inject directly into a vein.  \n \nAfter injecting \n• As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. \n\nThis will keep the Lyumjev sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the \npen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace \nthe cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen. \n\n  \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nFurther injections \n• Every time you plan to make an injection use a new needle. Before every injection, prime the \n\npen to clear any large air bubbles.  \n• Once the cartridge is empty, do not use it again.  \n \nIf you take more Lyumjev than you need \nIf you inject too much Lyumjev, a low blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or \ndrink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you \nand have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check \nyour blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. \n \nIf you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, \nhave difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. \nThis can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If \nglucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to \ntell you about glucagon. \n \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical \nhelp straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nIf you forget to use Lyumjev \nIf you forget to use your insulin or you take less than you need, your blood sugar may get too high \n(hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your \nusual dosing schedule at your next meal. \n \nIf you stop using Lyumjev \nDo not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you take less Lyumjev than you \nneed, a high blood sugar may occur. \n \nIf high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  \n \nThree simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n• Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get \n\ndamaged. \n• Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n• Always carry sugar with you. \n  \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 \nunder ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need’. \n \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nAllergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may \ninclude the following symptoms: \n \n\n• rash over the whole body  \n• difficulty in breathing  \n• wheezing \n\n• blood pressure dropping  \n• heart beating fast  \n• sweating \n\n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the \ningredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight \naway. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon  \nInjection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the \ninsulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop \nLyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nThere are several skin changes that can happen if you inject insulin too often at the same place called \nlipodystrophy which is where skin can shrink (lipoatrophy), thicken (lipohypertrophy) or get lumps \nunder the skin caused by a build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). Tell your \ndoctor if you get lipodystrophy at the injection site, rash or very itchy skin. Change the injection site \nwith each injection to help prevent skin changes. \n \nOther potential side effects \nSwelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or \nduring a change in your diabetes medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nLow blood sugar  \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n• you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; \n• you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n• you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n• you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n• there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble \n\nwith your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \nSee section “If you take more Lyumjev than you need”. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n \n• tiredness \n• rapid heart beat \n• nervousness or shakiness \n• feeling sick \n• headache \n• cold sweat \n \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\nIf you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too \nhigh. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n• not taking your insulin; \n• using less insulin than your body needs; \n• an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or \n• fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nThe early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  \n• being very thirsty  \n• headache  \n• feeling sleepy \n• urinating more often \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: \n• nausea and/or vomiting \n• abdominal pain \n• rapid pulse \n• heavy breathing \n• moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for \n\nenergy instead of glucose. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. \nSee section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Lyumjev \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nBefore first use \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C).  \nDo not freeze.  \nKeep in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter first use (after cartridge insertion into the pen) \nDo not store above 30 °C.  \nDo not freeze.  \nDo not refrigerate.  \n \nThe pen with the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached.  \nKeep the cap on the pen in order to protect from light. \nDiscard after 28 days even if some of the solution remains. \n \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you use Lyumjev KwikPen \n3. How to use Lyumjev KwikPen \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Lyumjev KwikPen \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lyumjev KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nLyumjev 100 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active ingredient \ninsulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes in adults. It is a mealtime insulin that works more \nquickly than other medicinecontaining insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up \nabsorption of insulin lispro into the body. \n \nDiabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin \neffectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin \nmedicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of \ndiabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. \n \nTreatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from \nyour diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up \nto 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not \nchange your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \nThe Lyumjev 100 units/ml KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, \n100 units/ml) of insulin lispro.  One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin. The KwikPen dials \n1 unit at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before \nyour injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than \n60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev KwikPen \n \nDo NOT use Lyumjev KwikPen  \n• if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on, this leaflet tells you \n\nhow to deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you take more Lyumjev than you \nneed”). \n\n• if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. \n \nIf you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. \n \n• Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  \nLow blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  \nLyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia \noccurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia \nor have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar \nlevels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may \nnot feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later \nin this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. \n\n \nYou must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. \nYou must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. \nMaking changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  \nIt may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood \nsugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicine.  \n \n• High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   \nStopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic \nketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common \nproblems of diabetes”. \n \n• If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicinecalled \n\nthiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you \nget signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). \n\n• If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using \nthis medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. \n\n• Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from \nyour pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. \n\n• Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you \ncan then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side \neffects”. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a \nneedle is blocked replace it with a new needle. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this \nmedicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Lyumjev \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange. \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n \nYour blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   \n \n• other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \n• sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) \n• acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) \n• some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) \n• some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for \n\nsome heart problems or high blood pressure) \n• angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) \n• somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving \n\ntoo much growth hormone) \n \nYour blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n \n• danazol (for endometriosis)  \n• the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) \n• thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) \n• human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) \n• diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body)  \n• sympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  \n• corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) \n \nBeta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the \nwarning signs of low blood sugar.  \n \nLyumjev with alcohol \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you \nneed usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. \nAfter you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed \nbefore your pregnancy.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, \nyou may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: \n• frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n• reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nLyumjev KwikPen contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Lyumjev KwikPen \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \ntold you. Check with them if you are not sure.  \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \nThey will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will \nalso tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle \nis changed. \n \nYou should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. \n \nIf you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to make your injections. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject \nthem separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nWhen to inject Lyumjev \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two \nbefore the meal; you also have the option to inject up to 20 minutes after starting the meal. \n \n How much insulin to use \nYour doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  \n• How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. \n• How and when to check your blood sugar level.  \n• How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. \n• What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are \n\nusing other medicines. \n• If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This \n\nmight just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n \nDo not use Lyumjev \n• If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. \n\nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n• If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). \n• If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  \n \nGetting the KwikPen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) \n• First wash your hands. \n• Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n• Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). \n• Prime your KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and clears the air \n\nbubbles from your KwikPen. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. Small air \nbubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. \n\n• The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. \n \n\nInjecting Lyumjev  \n• Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  \n• Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  \n• After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full \n\ndose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places \nyou inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen). \n\n• If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much \nyou still need to take. Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. \n\n• If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. \n• Do not inject directly into a vein.  \n  \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nAfter injecting \n• As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer \n\nneedle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air entering the pen \nand your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap \non your pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n• Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every injection, clear any air \n\nbubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing \nup.  \n\n• Once the KwikPen is empty, do not use it again. \n \nIf you take more Lyumjev than you need \nIf you inject too much Lyumjev, a low blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or \ndrink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you \nand have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check \nyour blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. \n \nIf you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, \nhave difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. \nThis can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If \nglucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to \ntell you about glucagon. \n \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical \nhelp straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nIf you forget to use Lyumjev \nIf you forget to use your insulin or you take less than you need, your blood sugar may get too high \n(hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your \nusual dosing schedule at your next meal. \n \nIf you stop using Lyumjev \nDo not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you take less Lyumjev than you \nneed, a high blood sugar may occur. \n \nIf high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  \n \nThree simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n• Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n• Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n• Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 \nunder ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need’. \n \nAllergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may \ninclude the following symptoms: \n \n\n• rash over the whole body  \n• difficulty in breathing  \n• wheezing \n\n• blood pressure dropping  \n• heart beating fast  \n• sweating \n\n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the \ningredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight \naway. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon  \nInjection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the \ninsulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop \nLyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nThere are several skin changes that can happen if you inject insulin too often at the same place called \nlipodystrophy which is where skin can shrink (lipoatrophy), thicken (lipohypertrophy) or get lumps \nunder the skin caused by a build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). Tell your \ndoctor if you get lipodystrophy at the injection site, rash or very itchy skin. Change the injection site \nwith each injection to help prevent skin changes. \n \nOther potential side effects \nSwelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or \nduring a change in your diabetes medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nLow blood sugar  \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n• you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; \n• you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n• you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n• you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n• there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble \n\nwith your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \nSee section “If you take more Lyumjev than you need”. \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n \n• tiredness \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n• rapid heart beat \n• nervousness or shakiness \n• feeling sick \n• headache \n• cold sweat \n \nIf you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too \nhigh. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n• not taking your insulin; \n• using less insulin than your body needs; \n• an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or \n• fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nThe early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  \n• being very thirsty  \n• headache  \n• feeling sleepy \n• urinating more often \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: \n• nausea and/or vomiting \n• abdominal pain \n• rapid pulse \n• heavy breathing \n• moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for \n\nenergy instead of glucose. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. \nSee section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Lyumjev KwikPen \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nBefore first use \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C).  \nDo not freeze.  \nKeep in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nAfter first use  \nDo not store above 30 °C.  \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\nDo not freeze.  \nDo not refrigerate.  \n \nThe KwikPen should not be stored with the needle attached. Keep the cap on the pen in order to \nprotect from light. \nDiscard after 28 days even if some of the solution remains. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your \nhealthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. \n \nDo not share your Lyumjev KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do \nnot reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or \nget a serious infection from them. \n \nLyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL (300 units, \n100 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  \n• Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to \n\ninject your prescribed dose of insulin. \n• You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  \n• Each turn of the dose knob dials 1 unit of insulin. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single \n\ninjection. \n• If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always \n\ncheck the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. \n• The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The \n\nplunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in the Pen. \n \nPeople who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person \ntrained to use the Pen. \n \n\nLyumjev KwikPen Parts \n \n\n Pen Cap       Cartridge Holder    Label Dose Indicator \n\n \n\n Cap Clip Rubber Seal Plunger Pen Body Dose \nWindow \n\nDose \nKnob \n\n \n \n\nPen Needle Parts \n(Needles Not Included) \n\nDose Knob \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n Outer Needle \nShield \n\nInner \nNeedle \n\nNeedle Paper Tab   \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\nShield \n \n\nHow to recognize your Lyumjev KwikPen \n• Pen colour:  Taupe \n\n• Dose Knob:  Blue, with raised ridges on side \n\n• Label:  Blue and white \n \n \nSupplies needed to give your injection \n• Lyumjev KwikPen \n\n• KwikPen compatible needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen needles \nrecommended) \n\n• Swab or gauze \n \n \nPreparing your Pen \n• Wash your hands with soap and water. \n\n• Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important \nif you use more than 1 type of insulin. \n\n• Do not use your Pen past the expiry date printed on the label or for more than 28 days after you \nfirst start using the Pen. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles.  \n\n \nStep 1: \n• Pull the Pen cap straight off. \n\n– Do not remove the Pen label. \n\n• Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. \n\n \n \n\nStep 2: \n• Check the liquid in the Pen. \n\n• Lyumjev should look clear and colourless. Do \nnot use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has \nparticles or clumps in it. \n\n \n\nStep 3: \n• Select a new needle. \n\n• Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle \nshield. \n\n \n\nStep 4: \n• Push the capped needle straight onto the Pen \n\nand twist the needle on until it is tight. \n\n \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\nStep 5: \n• Pull off the outer needle shield. Do not throw \n\nit away. \n\n• Pull off the inner needle shield and throw it \naway. \n\n \n\n \n \nPriming your Pen \nPrime before each injection. \n• Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during \n\nnormal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly. \n\n• If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. \n\n \nStep 6: \n• To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to select \n\n2 units. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 7: \n• Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. Tap \n\nthe cartridge holder gently to collect air bubbles \nat the top. \n\n \n\nStep 8: \n• Continue holding your Pen with the needle \n\npointing up. Push the dose knob in until it stops \nand “0” is seen in the dose window. Hold the \ndose knob in and count to 5 slowly. \n\nYou should see insulin at the tip of the needle. \n\n– If you do not see insulin, repeat priming \nsteps 6 to 8, but not more than 4 times. \n\n– If you still do not see insulin, change the \nneedle and repeat priming steps 6 to 8. \n\nSmall air bubbles are normal and will not affect your \ndose. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \nSelecting your dose \n• You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. \n\n• If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. \n\n– If you need help with dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. \n\nKeep \nThrow \nAway \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n– Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. \n\n \nStep 9: \n• Turn the dose knob to select the number of units \n\nyou need to inject. The dose indicator should \nline up with your dose. \n\n– The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. \n\n– The dose knob clicks as you turn it. \n\n– Do not dial your dose by counting the \nclicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This \nmay lead to getting too much insulin or not \nenough insulin. \n\n– The dose can be corrected by turning the \ndose knob in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the dose indicator. \n\n– The even numbers are printed on the dial. \nThe example to the right shows 12 units. \n\n– The odd numbers, after the number 1, are \nshown as full lines between the numbers. \nThe example to the right shows 25 units. \n\n• Always check the number in the dose window \nto make sure you have dialed the correct \ndose. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n  \nExample: 12 units \nshown in the dose \nwindow \n\n \n\n  \nExample: 25 units \nshown in the dose \nwindow \n\n \n• The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. \n\n• If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: \n\n– inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, \n\nor \n\n– get a new Pen and inject the full dose. \n\n• It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. \n \n \nGiving your injection \n• Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. \n\n• Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. \n\n• Do not try to change your dose while injecting. \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\n \nStep 10: \n• Choose your injection site. \n\n Lyumjev is injected under the skin \n(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, \nbuttocks, upper legs or upper arms. \n\n• Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your \nskin dry before you inject your dose. \n\n \n\n \n\nStep 11: \n• Insert the needle into your skin. \n\n• Push the dose knob all the way in. \n\n \n\n• Continue to hold the dose \nknob in and slowly count to \n5 before removing the \nneedle.  \n\nDo not try to inject your insulin by turning the \ndose knob. You will not receive your insulin by \nturning the dose knob. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 sec \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\nStep 12: \n• Pull the needle out of your skin. \n\n– A drop of insulin at the needle tip is normal. \nIt will not affect your dose. \n\n• Check the number in the dose window. \n\n– If you see “0” in the dose window, you have \nreceived the full amount you dialed. \n\n– If you do not see “0” in the dose window, \nyou did not receive your full dose. Do not \nredial. Insert the needle into your skin and \nfinish your injection. \n\n– If you still do not think you received the full \namount you dialed for your injection, do not \nstart over or repeat that injection. Monitor \nyour blood glucose as instructed by your \nhealthcare professional. \n\n– If you normally need to give 2 injections for \nyour full dose, be sure to give your second \ninjection. \n\nThe plunger only moves a little with each injection, \nand you may not notice that it moves. \n\nIf you see blood after you take the needle out of your \nskin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of \ngauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAfter your injection \nStep 13: \n• Carefully replace the outer needle shield. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nStep 14: \n• Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it as \n\ndescribed below (see Disposing of Pens and \nneedles section). \n\n• Do not store the Pen with the needle attached to \nprevent leaking, blocking the needle, and air \nfrom entering the Pen.  \n\nStep 15: \n• Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip \n\nwith the dose indicator and pushing straight on. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n \nDisposing of Pens and needles \n•  Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw \n\nneedles directly into your household waste. \n\n•  Do not recycle the filled sharps container. \n\n•  Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container \nproperly. \n\n•  The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare \nprofessional or institutional policies. \n\n \n \n \nTroubleshooting \n• If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap \n\nstraight off. \n\n• If the dose knob is hard to push: \n\n– pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. \n\n– your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. \n\n– you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. \n \nIf you have any questions or problems with your Lyumjev 100 units/mL KwikPen, call your \nhealthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.  \n \nDocument Revision Date:  \n \n \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nLyumjev 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen \ninsulin lispro \n\n \nEach Junior KwikPen delivers 0.5 to 30 units in steps of 0.5 units. \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lyumjev Junior KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nLyumjev 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active \ningredient insulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes in adults. It is a mealtime insulin that works \nmore quickly than other medicinecontaining insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up \nabsorption of insulin lispro into the body. \n \nDiabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin \neffectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin \nmedicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of \ndiabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. \n \nTreatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from \nyour diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up \nto 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not \nchange your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \nLyumjev 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (300 units, \n100 units/ml) of insulin lispro. One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin. The KwikPen dials \nhalf unit (0.5 unit) at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check \nthis before your injection. You can give from 0.5 unit to 30 units in a single injection. If your dose is \nmore than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen   \n \nDo NOT use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen  \n• if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on this leaflet tells you how \n\nto deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you take more Lyumjev than you need”). \n• if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. \n \nIf you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. \n \n• Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  \nLow blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  \nLyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia \noccurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia \nor have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar \nlevels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may \nnot feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later \nin this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. \n\n \nYou must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. \nYou must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. \nMaking changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  \nIt may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood \nsugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicine.  \n \n• High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   \nStopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic \nketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common \nproblems of diabetes”. \n \n• If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicinecalled \n\nthiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you \nget signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). \n\n• If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using \nthis medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. \n\n• Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from \nyour pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. \n\n• Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you \ncan then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side \neffects”. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a \nneedle is blocked replace it with a new needle. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this \nmedicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Lyumjev \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange. \n \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   \n \n• other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \n• sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) \n• acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) \n• some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) \n• some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for \n\nsome heart problems or high blood pressure) \n• angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) \n• somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving \n\ntoo much growth hormone) \n \nYour blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n \n• danazol (for endometriosis)  \n• the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) \n• thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) \n• human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) \n• diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body) \n\nsympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  \n• corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) \n\n \nBeta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the \nwarning signs of low blood sugar.  \n \nLyumjev with alcohol \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you \nneed usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. \nAfter you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed \nbefore your pregnancy.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, \nyou may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: \n• frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n• reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \nLyumjev Junior KwikPen contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Lyumjev Junior KwikPen  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \ntold you. Check with them if you are not sure.  \n \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\nThey will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will \nalso tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle \nis changed. \n \nYou should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. \n \nIf you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to make your injections. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject \nthem separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nWhen to inject Lyumjev \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two \nbefore the meal; you also have the option to inject  up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  \n \nHow much insulin to use \nYour doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  \n• How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. \n• How and when to check your blood sugar level. \n• How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. \n• What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are \n\nusing other medicines. \n• If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This \n\nmight just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n \nDo not use Lyumjev \n• If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. \n\nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n• If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). \n• If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  \n \nGetting the Lyumjev Junior KwikPen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) \n• First wash your hands. \n• Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n• Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). \n• Prime your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out and \n\nclears the air bubbles from your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen. There may still be some small air \nbubbles left in the pen. Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. \n\n• The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. \n \nInjecting Lyumjev  \n• Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  \n• Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  \n• After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full \n\ndose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places \nyou inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen).  \n\n• If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much \nyou still need to take.  Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. \n\n• If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. \n• Do not inject directly into a vein.  \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\n \nAfter injecting \n• As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Lyumjev Junior KwikPen \n\nusing the outer needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also stops air \nentering the pen and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share your \npen. Replace the cap on your pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n• Every time you use a Lyumjev Junior KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every \n\ninjection, clear any air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Lyumjev \nJunior KwikPen with the needle pointing up.  \n\n• Once the Lyumjev Junior KwikPen is empty, do not use it again.  \n \nIf you take more Lyumjev than you need \nIf you inject too much Lyumjev, a low blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or \ndrink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you \nand have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check \nyour blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. \n \nIf you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, \nhave difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. \nThis can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If \nglucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to \ntell you about glucagon. \n \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical \nhelp straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nIf you forget to use Lyumjev \nIf you forget to use your insulin or you take less than you need, your blood sugar may get too high \n(hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your \nusual dosing schedule at your next meal. \n \nIf you stop using Lyumjev \nDo not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you take less Lyumjev than you \nneed, a high blood sugar may occur. \n \nIf high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  \n \nThree simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n• Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen or it gets damaged. \n• Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n• Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \n\n\n\n117 \n \n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 \nunder ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need’. \n \nAllergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may \ninclude the following symptoms: \n \n\n• rash over the whole body  \n• difficulty in breathing  \n• wheezing \n\n• blood pressure dropping  \n• heart beating fast  \n• sweating \n\n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the \ningredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight \naway. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon  \nInjection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the \ninsulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop \nLyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nThere are several skin changes that can happen if you inject insulin too often at the same place called \nlipodystrophy which is where skin can shrink (lipoatrophy), thicken (lipohypertrophy) or get lumps \nunder the skin caused by a build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). Tell your \ndoctor if you get lipodystrophy at the injection site, rash or very itchy skin. Change the injection site \nwith each injection to help prevent skin changes. \n \nOther potential side effects \nSwelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or \nduring a change in your diabetes medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \nCommon problems of diabetes \n \nLow blood sugar  \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if: \n• you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; \n• you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n• you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n• you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n• there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble \n\nwith your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n See section ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need.’ \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n \n• tiredness \n\n\n\n118 \n \n\n• rapid heart beat \n• nervousness or shakiness \n• feeling sick \n• headache \n• cold sweat \n \nIf you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too \nhigh. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n• not taking your insulin; \n• using less insulin than your body needs; \n• an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or \n• fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nThe early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  \n• being very thirsty  \n• headache  \n• feeling sleepy \n• urinating more often \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: \n• nausea and/or vomiting \n• abdominal pain \n• rapid pulse \n• heavy breathing \n• moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for \n\nenergy instead of glucose. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. \nSee section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. \n \n \n5. How to store Lyumjev Junior KwikPen \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to \nyour healthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. \n \nDo not share your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been \nchanged. Do not reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious \ninfection or get a serious infection from them. \n \nLyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL \n(300 units, 100 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  \n• Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to \n\ninject your prescribed dose of insulin. \n• You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  \n• Each turn of the dose knob dials half (0.5 unit) of insulin. You can give from half (0.5 unit) to \n\n30 units in a single injection. \n• If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always \n\ncheck the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. \n• The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The \n\nplunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 300 units in the Pen. \n \nPeople who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person \ntrained to use the Pen. \n \n\nLyumjev Junior KwikPen Parts \n \n\n Pen Cap  Cartridge Holder     Label Dose Indicator \n\n \n\n Cap Clip Rubber Seal Plunger       Pen Body Dose \nWindow \n\nDose \nKnob \n\n \n \n\nPen Needle Parts \n(Needles Not Included) \n\nDose Knob \n \n\n \n\n  \n Outer Needle Inner Needle Needle Paper Tab   \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\nShield Shield \n \nHow to recognize your Lyumjev Junior KwikPen \n• Pen colour:  Taupe \n\n• Dose knob:  Peach, with raised ridges on end and side \n\n• Label:  White with a peach colour bar, and peach, light blue and dark blue \n   colour band \n \n \nSupplies needed to give your injection \n• Lyumjev Junior KwikPen \n\n• KwikPen compatible needle (BD [Becton, Dickinson and Company] Pen needles \nrecommended) \n\n• Swab or gauze \n \n \nPreparing your Pen \n• Wash your hands with soap and water. \n\n• Check the Pen to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important \nif you use more than 1 type of insulin. \n\n• Do not use your Pen past the expiry date printed on the label or for more than 28 days after you \nfirst start using the Pen. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles.  \n \nStep 1: \n• Pull the Pen cap straight off. \n\n– Do not remove the Pen label. \n\n• Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. \n\n \n \n\nStep 2: \n• Check the liquid in the Pen. \n\n• Lyumjev should look clear and colourless. Do \nnot use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has particles \nor clumps in it. \n\n \n\nStep 3: \n• Select a new needle. \n\n• Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle \nshield. \n\n \n\nStep 4: \n• Push the capped needle straight onto the Pen \n\nand twist the needle on until it is tight. \n\n \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\nStep 5: \n• Pull off the outer needle shield. Do not throw it \n\naway. \n\n• Pull off the inner needle shield and throw it \naway. \n\n \n\n \n \nPriming your Pen \nPrime before each injection. \n• Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during \n\nnormal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly.  \n\n• If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. \n \nStep 6: \n• To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to select \n\n2 units. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 7: \n• Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. Tap \n\nthe cartridge holder gently to collect air bubbles \nat the top. \n\n \n\nStep 8: \n• Continue holding your Pen with the needle \n\npointing up. Push the dose knob in until it stops \nand “0” is seen in the dose window. Hold the \ndose knob in and count to 5 slowly. \n\nYou should see insulin at the tip of the needle. \n\n– If you do not see insulin, repeat priming steps 6 \nto 8, but not more than 4 times. \n\n– If you still do not see insulin, change the needle \nand repeat priming steps 6 to 8. \n\nSmall air bubbles are normal and will not affect your \ndose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \nSelecting your dose \n• You can give from half unit (0.5 unit) to 30 units in a single injection. \n\n• If your dose is more than 30 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. \n\n– If you need help with dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. \n\nKeep Throw Away \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\n– Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. \n\n– If you usually need more than 30 units, ask your healthcare professional if a different \nLyumjev KwikPen would be better for you. \n\n \nStep 9: \n• Turn the dose knob to select the number of units \n\nyou need to inject. The dose indicator should \nline up with your dose. \n\n– The Pen dials half unit (0.5 unit) at a time. \n\n– The dose knob clicks as you turn it. \n\n– Do not dial your dose by counting the \nclicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This \nmay lead to getting too much insulin or not \nenough insulin. \n\n– The dose can be corrected by turning the \ndose knob in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the dose indicator. \n\n– The whole unit numbers are printed on the \ndial. The example to the right shows 4 units. \n\n– The half units are shown as lines between \nthe whole unit numbers. The example to the \nright shows 10.5 units. \n\n• Always check the number in the dose window \nto make sure you have dialed the correct \ndose. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nExample: 4 units \nshown in the dose \nwindow \n\n \nExample: 10 ½ (10.5) \nunits shown in the dose \nwindow \n\n \n• The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. \n\n• If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: \n\n– inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, \n\nor \n\n– get a new Pen and inject the full dose. \n\n• It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. \n \n \nGiving your injection \n• Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. \n\n• Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. \n\n• Do not try to change your dose while injecting. \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\n \nStep 10: \n• Choose your injection site. \n\n Lyumjev is injected under the skin \n(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, \nbuttocks, upper legs or upper arms. \n\n• Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your \nskin dry before you inject your dose. \n\n \n \n\nStep 11: \n• Insert the needle into your skin. \n\n• Push the dose knob all the way in. \n\n \n\n• Continue to hold the dose \nknob in and slowly count to \n5 before removing the \nneedle.  \n\nDo not try to inject your insulin by turning the \ndose knob. You will not receive your insulin by \nturning the dose knob. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 sec \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\nStep 12: \n• Pull the needle out of your skin. \n\n– A drop of insulin at the needle tip is \nnormal. It will not affect your dose. \n\n• Check the number in the dose window. \n\n– If you see “0” in the dose window, \nyou have received the full amount \nyou dialed. \n\n– If you do not see “0” in the dose \nwindow, you did not receive your \nfull dose. Do not redial. Insert the \nneedle into your skin and finish your \ninjection. \n\n– If you still do not think you received \nthe full amount you dialed for your \ninjection, do not start over or \nrepeat that injection. Monitor your \nblood glucose as instructed by your \nhealthcare professional. \n\n– If you normally need to give \n2 injections for your full dose, be \nsure to give your second injection. \n\nThe plunger only moves a little with each \ninjection, and you may not notice that it moves. \n\nIf you see blood after you take the needle out \nof your skin, press the injection site lightly \nwith a piece of gauze or a swab. Do not rub the \narea. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nAfter your injection \nStep 13: \n• Carefully replace the outer needle shield. \n\n \n\nStep 14: \n• Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it as \n\ndescribed below (see Disposing of Pens and \nneedles section). \n\n• Do not store the Pen with the needle attached to \nprevent leaking, blocking the needle, and air \nfrom entering the Pen. \n\n \n\nStep 15: \n• Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip \n\nwith the dose indicator and pushing straight on. \n\n \n\n \n \nDisposing of Pens and needles \n•  Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw \n\nneedles directly into your household waste. \n\n•  Do not recycle the filled sharps container. \n\n•  Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container \nproperly. \n\n•  The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare \nprofessional or institutional policies. \n\n \nTroubleshooting \n• If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap \n\nstraight off. \n\n• If the dose knob is hard to push: \n\n– pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. \n\n– your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. \n\n– you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. \n\n \nIf you have any questions or problems with your Lyumjev 100 units/mL Junior KwikPen, call your \nhealthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.  \n \nDocument Revision Date:  \n \n \n \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nLyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen \ninsulin lispro \n\n \nEach KwikPen delivers 1 to 60 units in steps of 1 units \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen is and what it is used for \n \nLyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in pre-filled pen contains the active ingredient \ninsulin lispro. Lyumjev is used to treat diabetes in adults. It is a mealtime insulin that works more \nquickly than other medicinecontaining insulin lispro. Lyumjev contains ingredients that speed up \nabsorption of insulin lispro into the body. \n \nDiabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin \neffectively, which results in effects such as high levels of sugar in the blood. Lyumjev is an insulin \nmedicinethat is used in the treatment of diabetes and so controls blood sugar. Effective treatment of \ndiabetes, with good control of blood sugar, prevents long-term complications from your diabetes. \n \nTreatment with Lyumjev helps to control blood sugar in the long term and prevent complications from \nyour diabetes. Lyumjev has its maximum effect 1 to 3 hours after injection and the effect lasts for up \nto 5 hours. You should use Lyumjev at the start of the meal, or up to 20 minutes after starting the \nmeal. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Do not \nchange your insulin unless your doctor tells you to.  \n \nLyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 ml (600 units, \n200 units/ml) of insulin lispro. One KwikPen contains multiple doses of insulin. The KwikPen dials \n1 unit at a time. The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before \nyour injection. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. If your dose is more than \n60 units, you will need to give yourself more than one injection.  \n \n \n\n\n\n129 \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen \n \nDo NOT use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen  \n• if you think your blood sugar is dropping (hypoglycaemia). Further on this leaflet tells you how \n\nto deal with low blood sugar (see section 3 under “If you take more Lyumjev than you need”). \n• if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n• The Lyumjev 200 units/ml solution for injection in your pre-filled pen (the KwikPen) \n\nshould ONLY be injected with this pre-filled pen. Do not transfer the insulin lispro from \nyour Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will \nnot measure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can result, causing low blood sugar which \nmay put your life in danger. Do not transfer insulin from your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen \nto any other insulin delivery devices like insulin infusion pumps. \n\n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lyumjev. \n \nIf you cannot see very well you will need help from someone who has been trained to give injections. \n \n• Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).  \nLow blood sugar can be serious and untreated hypoglycaemia may even lead to death.  \nLyumjev starts to lower blood sugar faster than some other mealtime insulins. If hypoglycaemia \noccurs, you may experience it earlier after an injection of Lyumjev. If you often have hypoglycaemia \nor have difficulty recognising it, please discuss this with your doctor or nurse. If your blood sugar \nlevels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy or after long duration of diabetes, you may \nnot feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low.Warning signs are listed later \nin this leaflet. For symptoms please see “Common problems of diabetes”. \n\n \nYou must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. \nYou must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood sugar often. \nMaking changes to the types of  insulin you use may cause your blood sugar to rise or fall too much.  \nIt may be necessary to increase the frequency of blood sugar testing if you are at risk of low blood \nsugars. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your other diabetes medicine.  \n \n• High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).   \nStopping or not taking enough insulin may lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic \nketoacidosis, serious conditions that can even lead to death. For symptoms please see “Common \nproblems of diabetes”. \n \n• If your insulin treatment is being combined with one of a class of diabetes medicinecalled \n\nthiazolidinediones or glitazones, such as pioglitazone, tell your doctor as soon as possible if you \nget signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or \nlocalised swelling caused by fluid retention (oedema). \n\n• If you have a serious allergic reaction to insulin or any of the ingredients in Lyumjev, stop using \nthis medicine and contact emergency medical services straight away. \n\n• Always check the pack and the label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from \nyour pharmacy. Make sure you get the Lyumjev that your doctor has told you to use. \n\n• Keep the carton, or keep a note of the batch number on the carton.  If you have a side effect you \ncan then provide that number when you report the advere side effect, see “reporting of side \neffects”. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent infections and blocked needles.  If a \nneedle is blocked replace it with a new needle. \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be used in children or adolescents, since there is no experience with this \nmedicine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Lyumjev \nTell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level - this may mean your insulin dose has to \nchange. \n \nYour blood sugar levels may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take:   \n \n• other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable)  \n• sulphonamide antibiotics (for infections) \n• acetylsalicylic acid (for pain and mild fever and to prevent blood clotting) \n• some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) \n• some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril) (for \n\nsome heart problems or high blood pressure) \n• angiotensin II receptor blockers (for high blood pressure or heart problems) \n• somatostatin analogues (such as octreotide, which are used to treat a rare condition involving \n\ntoo much growth hormone) \n \nYour blood sugar levels may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: \n \n• danazol (for endometriosis)  \n• the contraceptive pill (birth control pills) \n• thyroid hormone replacement therapy (for thyroid problems) \n• human growth hormone (for growth hormone deficiency) \n• diuretics (for high blood pressure or if you have a build-up of water in your body) \n\nsympathomimetic agents (for serious allergic reactions or used in some cold remedies)  \n• corticosteroids (to treat asthma or autoimmune conditions) \n \nBeta-blockers (used for high blood pressure, arrhythmia or angina) make it harder to recognise the \nwarning signs of low blood sugar.  \n \nLyumjev with alcohol \nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. Therefore the amount of insulin \nneeded may change. You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are planning to have a baby, think you may be pregnant, are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask \nyour doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. The amount of insulin you \nneed usually falls during the first 3 months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining 6 months. \nAfter you have had your baby your insulin requirements will likely return to how much you needed \nbefore your pregnancy.  \n \nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Lyumjev during breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, \nyou may need to alter your insulin intake or diet. \n \nDriving and using machines \nYour ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this \npossible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving \na car or using machines). You should contact your doctor about driving if you have: \n• frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia \n• reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia \n \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\nLyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet or as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has \ntold you. Check with them if you are not sure.  \n \nThey will have told you exactly how much Lyumjev to use, when to use it, and how often. They will \nalso tell you how often to visit your diabetes clinic.  \n \nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by you only, even if the needle \nis changed. \n \nDo not use Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen solution for injection in an insulin infusion pump. \n \nYou should always have spare insulin and another injection device in case you need them. \n \nIf you are blind or visually impaired you will need help from someone to make your injections. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to use Lyumjev as well as a longer- or intermediate-acting insulin. Inject \nthem separately. Lyumjev should not be mixed with any other insulin. \n \nWhen to inject Lyumjev \nLyumjev is a mealtime insulin. You should use Lyumjev when you start to eat, or a minute or two \nbefore the meal; you also have the option to inject  up to 20 minutes after starting the meal.  \n \nHow much insulin to use \nYour doctor will work out your dose based on your blood sugar and body weight and explain  \n• How much Lyumjev you need at each meal. \n• How and when to check your blood sugar level. \n• How to change your insulin dose depending on your blood sugar levels. \n• What to do if you change your diet, or change how much you exercise, if you are ill or if you are \n\nusing other medicines. \n• If you change the type of insulin you use, you may have to take more or less than before. This \n\nmight just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.  \n \nDo not use Lyumjev \n• If it does not look like water. Lyumjev must be clear, have no colour and no solid pieces in it. \n\nCheck each time you inject yourself. \n• If Lyumjev has not been stored correctly (see section 5 “How to store Lyumjev”). \n• If the pen is damaged in any way, do not use.  \n \nGetting the Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen ready to use (Please see instructions for use) \n• First wash your hands. \n• Read the instructions on how to use your pre-filled insulin pen. Please follow the instructions \n\ncarefully. Here are some reminders. \n• Use a new needle. (Needles are not included). \n• Prime your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen before each use. This checks that insulin comes out \n\nand clears the air bubbles from your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen. There may still be some \nsmall air bubbles left in the pen. Small air bubbles are normal and will not affect your dose. \n\n• The number of units are displayed in the dose window, always check this before your injection. \n \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\nInjecting Lyumjev  \n• Before you make an injection, clean your skin.  \n• Inject under the skin (subcutaneous injection), as you were taught by your physician or nurse.  \n• After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for 5 seconds to make sure you receive the full \n\ndose. Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places \nyou inject (upper arm, thigh, buttocks or abdomen).  \n\n• If you do not have enough insulin in the pen to complete your dose, make a note of how much \nyou still need to take.  Prime a new pen and inject the remaining dose. \n\n• If you need to inject another insulin at the same time as Lyumjev, use a different injection site. \n• Do not inject directly into a vein.  \n \nAfter injecting \n• As soon as you have done the injection, unscrew the needle from the Lyumjev 200 units/ml \n\nKwikPen using the outer needle cap. This will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking. It also \nstops air entering the pen and your needle clogging. Do not share your needles. Do not share \nyour pen. Replace the cap on your pen. \n\n \nFurther injections \n• Every time you use a Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen you must use a new needle. Before every \n\ninjection, clear any air bubbles. You can see how much insulin is left by holding the Lyumjev \n200 units/ml KwikPen with the needle pointing up.  \n\n• Once the Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen is empty, do not use it again.  \n \nIf you take more Lyumjev than you need \nIf you inject too much Lyumjev, a low blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar.  \n \nIf your blood sugar is low (hypoglycaemia) and you can treat yourself, eat glucose tablets, sugar or \ndrink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor or nurse has advised you \nand have some rest. This will often get you over a low blood sugar or a minor insulin overdose. Check \nyour blood sugar again after 15-20 mins until blood sugar is stabilised. \n \nIf you are unable to treat yourself (severe hypoglycaemia) because you feel too dizzy, weak, confused, \nhave difficulty talking, lose consciousness or have a seizure you may need to be treated with glucagon. \nThis can be given by someone who knows how to use it. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon. If \nglucagon does not work, you will have to go to hospital or call emergency services. Ask your doctor to \ntell you about glucagon. \n \nTell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood \nsugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. \nLet them know that if you pass out, they must: turn you on your side to avoid choking, get medical \nhelp straight away and not give you any food or drink because you may choke.  \n \nIf you forget to use Lyumjev \nIf you forget to use your insulin or you take less than you need, your blood sugar may get too high \n(hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar level to decide if an insulin dose is needed. Resume your \nusual dosing schedule at your next meal. \n \nIf you stop using Lyumjev \nDo not stop or change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If you take less Lyumjev than you \nneed, a high blood sugar may occur. \n \nIf high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) is not treated it can be very serious and cause headaches, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even death (see section 4).  \n \nThree simple steps to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are: \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\n• Always keep a spare pen in case you lose your Lyumjev 200 units/ml KwikPen or it gets \ndamaged. \n\n• Always carry something to show you are diabetic. \n• Always carry sugar with you. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in \n10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become \nunconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If you \nhave symptoms of low blood sugar, act immediately to increase your blood sugar level. See section 3 \nunder ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need’. \n \nAllergic reactions are common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). They may be severe and they may \ninclude the following symptoms: \n \n\n• rash over the whole body  \n• difficulty in breathing  \n• wheezing \n\n• blood pressure dropping  \n• heart beating fast  \n• sweating \n\n \nIf you have a serious allergic reaction (including an anaphylactic attack) to insulin or any of the \ningredients in Lyumjev, stop using this medicine and contact emergency medical service straight \naway. \n \nOther side effects include: \n \nCommon  \nInjection site reactions. Some people get redness, pain, swelling or itching around the area of the \ninsulin injection. This usually clears up in a few minutes to a few weeks without needing to stop \nLyumjev. If you have injection site reactions, tell your doctor. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \nThere are several skin changes that can happen if you inject insulin too often at the same place called \nlipodystrophy which is where skin can shrink (lipoatrophy), thicken (lipohypertrophy) or get lumps \nunder the skin caused by a build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). Tell your \ndoctor if you get lipodystrophy at the injection site, rash or very itchy skin. Change the injection site \nwith each injection to help prevent skin changes. \n \nOther potential side effects \nSwelling in arms or ankles due to fluid retention (oedema) particularly at the start of insulin therapy or \nduring a change in your diabetes medicines. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.

This can be caused if: \n• you take too much Lyumjev or other insulin; \n• you miss or delay meals or change your diet; \n• you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal; \n• you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting); \n• there is a change in your need for insulin for example if you lose weight; or you have trouble \n\nwith your kidneys or liver which gets worse. \n See section ‘If you take more Lyumjev than you need.’ \n \nThe first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following: \n \n• tiredness \n• rapid heart beat \n• nervousness or shakiness \n• feeling sick \n• headache \n• cold sweat \n \nIf you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations such as driving a \ncar, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n \nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis \nHyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that the levels of glucose in your body are too \nhigh. Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by: \n• not taking your insulin; \n• using less insulin than your body needs; \n• an imbalance between the amount of carbohydrates you eat and the insulin you take; or \n• fever, infection or emotional stress. \n \nThe early symptoms of hyperglycaemia are;  \n• being very thirsty  \n• headache  \n• feeling sleepy \n• urinating more often \n \nHyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many \nhours or days. Additional symptoms include the following: \n• nausea and/or vomiting \n• abdominal pain \n• rapid pulse \n• heavy breathing \n• moderate or large amounts of urine ketones. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for \n\nenergy instead of glucose. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms and high sugars get medical help immediately. \nSee section ‘If you forget to use Lyumjev’. \n \nIllness \nIf you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even \nwhen you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your \n‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\n \n5.

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your \nhealthcare professional about your medical condition or your treatment. \n \nDo not share your Lyumjev KwikPen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. Do \nnot reuse or share needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or \nget a serious infection from them. \n \nLyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen (“Pen”) is a disposable pre-filled pen containing 3 mL (600 units, \n200 units/mL) of insulin lispro solution for injection.  \n• Your healthcare professional will tell you how many units to give as your dose and how to \n\ninject your prescribed dose of insulin. \n• You can give yourself more than 1 dose from the Pen.  \n• Each turn of the dose knob dials 1 unit of insulin. You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single \n\ninjection. \n• If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give yourself more than 1 injection. Always \n\ncheck the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. \n• The plunger only moves a little with each injection, and you may not notice that it moves. The \n\nplunger will only reach the end of the cartridge when you have used all 600 units in the Pen. \n \nThis Pen is designed to allow you to give more doses than other pens you may have used in the \npast. Dial your usual dose as instructed by your healthcare professional. \n \nLyumjev KwikPen is available in two strengths, 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL. Inject Lyumjev \n200 units/mL only with your Pen. Do not transfer insulin from your Pen to another insulin \ndelivery device. Syringes and insulin pumps will not measure 200 units/mL of insulin correctly. \nA severe overdose can result, causing very low blood sugar which may put your life in danger. \n \nPeople who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Pen without help from a person \ntrained to use the Pen. \n \n\nUSE ONLY IN THIS PEN, OR SEVERE \nOVERDOSE CAN RESULT \n\n\n\n139 \n \n\nLyumjev KwikPen Parts \n \n\n Pen Cap Cartridge Holder Label Dose Indicator \n\n \n\n Cap Clip Rubber Seal Plunger Pen Body Dose \nWindow \n\nDose  \nKnob \n\n     \n   \n\nPen Needle Parts \n(Needles Not Included) \n\nDose Knob \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n Outer Needle \nShield \n\nInner \nNeedle \nShield \n\nNeedle Paper Tab    \n\n \n \nHow to recognize your Lyumjev KwikPen \n• Pen colour:  Taupe \n• Dose Knob:  Taupe, with raised ridges on side \n• Label:   White with a blue colour bar and checkerboard design.

This is especially important \nif you use more than 1 type of insulin. \n\n• Do not use your Pen past the expiry date printed on the label or for more than 28 days after you \nfirst start using the Pen. \n\n• Always use a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and blocked needles.  \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n \n\nStep 1: \n• Pull the Pen cap straight off. \n\n– Do not remove the Pen label. \n\n• Wipe the rubber seal with a swab. \n\n   \n\n \nStep 2: \n• Check the liquid in the Pen.  \n\n• Lyumjev should look clear and colourless. Do \nnot use if it is cloudy, coloured, or has \nparticles or clumps in it. \n\n \n\nStep 3: \n• Select a new needle. \n\n• Pull off the paper tab from the outer needle \nshield. \n\n \n\nStep 4: \n• Push the capped needle straight onto the Pen \n\nand twist the needle on until it is tight. \n\n \n\nStep 5: \n• Pull off the outer needle shield. Do not throw \n\nit away. \n\n• Pull off the inner needle shield and throw it \naway. \n\n \n\n \n \nPriming your Pen \nPrime before each injection. \n• Priming your Pen means removing the air from the needle and cartridge that may collect during \n\nnormal use and ensures that your Pen is working correctly. \n\n• If you do not prime before each injection, you may get too much or too little insulin. \n \nStep 6: \n• To prime your Pen, turn the dose knob to select \n\n2 units. \n\n \n\nKeep Throw \nAway \n\nUSE ONLY IN THIS PEN, OR \nSEVERE OVERDOSE CAN RESULT \n\n\n\n141 \n \n\nStep 7: \n• Hold your Pen with the needle pointing up. Tap \n\nthe cartridge holder gently to collect air bubbles \nat the top. \n\n \n \n\nStep 8: \n• Continue holding your Pen with the needle \n\npointing up. Push the dose knob in until it stops \nand “0” is seen in the dose window. Hold the \ndose knob in and count to 5 slowly. \n\nYou should see insulin at the tip of the Needle. \n\n– If you do not see insulin, repeat priming \nsteps 6 to 8, but not more than 8 times. \n\n– If you still do not see insulin, change the \nneedle and repeat priming steps 6 to 8. \n\nSmall air bubbles are normal and will not affect your \ndose. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nSelecting your dose \nThis Pen has been designed to deliver the dose that is shown in the dose window. Dial your usual \ndose as instructed by your healthcare professional. \n\n• You can give from 1 to 60 units in a single injection. \n\n• If your dose is more than 60 units, you will need to give more than 1 injection. \n\n– If you need help dividing up your dose the right way, ask your healthcare professional. \n\n– Use a new needle for each injection and repeat the priming steps. \n\n\n\n142 \n \n\n \nStep 9: \n• Turn the dose knob to select the number of units \n\nyou need to inject. The dose indicator should \nline up with your dose. \n\n– The Pen dials 1 unit at a time. \n\n– The dose knob clicks as you turn it. \n\n– Do not dial your dose by counting the \nclicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This \nmay lead to getting too much insulin or not \nenough insulin. \n\n– The dose can be corrected by turning the \ndose knob in either direction until the \ncorrect dose lines up with the dose indicator. \n\n– The even numbers are printed on the dial. \nThe example to the right shows 12 units. \n\n– The odd numbers, after the number 1, are \nshown as full lines between the numbers. \nThe example to the right shows 25 units. \n\n• Always check the number in the dose \nwindow to make sure you have dialed the \ncorrect dose. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nExample: 12 units \nshown in the dose \nwindow \n\n \n\n \nExample: 25 units \nshown in the dose \nwindow \n\n \n• The Pen will not let you dial more than the number of units left in the Pen. \n\n• If you need to inject more than the number of units left in the Pen, you may either: \n\n– inject the amount left in your Pen and then use a new Pen to give the rest of your dose, \n\nor \n\n– get a new Pen and inject the full dose. \n\n• It is normal to see a small amount of insulin left in the Pen that you cannot inject. Do not \ntransfer this to a syringe. Severe overdose can result. \n\n \n \nGiving your injection \n• Inject your insulin as your healthcare professional has shown you. \n\n• Change (rotate) your injection site for each injection. \n\n• Do not try to change your dose while injecting. \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\n \nStep 10: \n• Choose your injection site. \n\n Lyumjev is injected under the skin \n(subcutaneously) of your stomach area, \nbuttocks, upper legs or upper arms. \n\n• Wipe your skin with a swab, and let your \nskin dry before you inject your dose. \n\n \n \n\nStep 11: \n• Insert the needle into your skin. \n\n• Push the dose knob all the way in. \n\n \n\n• Continue to hold the dose \nknob in and slowly count to \n5 before removing the \nneedle.  \n\nDo not try to inject your insulin by turning the \ndose knob. You will not receive your insulin by \nturning the dose knob. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 sec \n\n\n\n144 \n \n\nStep 12: \n• Pull the needle out of your skin. \n\n– A drop of insulin at the needle tip is normal. \nIt will not affect your dose. \n\n• Check the number in the dose window. \n\n– If you see “0” in the dose window, you have \nreceived the full amount you dialed. \n\n– If you do not see “0” in the dose window, \nyou did not receive your full dose. Do not \nredial. Insert the needle into your skin and \nfinish your injection. \n\n– If you still do not think you received the full \namount you dialed for your injection, do not \nstart over or repeat that injection. Monitor \nyour blood glucose as instructed by your \nhealthcare professional. \n\n– If you normally need to give 2 injections for \nyour full dose, be sure to give your second \ninjection. \n\nThe plunger only moves a little with each injection, \nand you may not notice that it moves. \n\nIf you see blood after you take the needle out of your \nskin, press the injection site lightly with a piece of \ngauze or a swab. Do not rub the area. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAfter your injection \nStep 13: \n• Carefully replace the outer needle shield. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 14: \n• Unscrew the capped needle and dispose of it as \n\ndescribed below (see Disposing of Pens and \nneedles section). \n\n• Do not store the Pen with the needle attached to \nprevent leaking, blocking the needle, and air \nfrom entering the Pen.  \n\n\n\n145 \n \n\nStep 15: \n• Replace the Pen cap by lining up the cap clip \n\nwith the dose indicator and pushing straight on. \n\n \n \n\n \n \nDisposing of Pens and needles \n•  Put used needles in a sharps container or a hard plastic container with a secure lid. Do not throw \n\nneedles directly into your household waste. \n\n•  Do not recycle the filled sharps container. \n\n•  Ask your healthcare professional about options to dispose of the Pen and the sharps container \nproperly. \n\n•  The directions regarding needle handling are not intended to replace local, healthcare \nprofessional or institutional policies. \n\n \nTroubleshooting \n• If you cannot remove the Pen cap, gently twist the cap back and forth, and then pull the cap \n\nstraight off. \n\n• If the dose knob is hard to push: \n\n– pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject. \n\n– your needle may be blocked. Put on a new needle and prime the Pen. \n\n– you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the Pen. Throw the Pen away and get a new Pen. \n\n \nIf you have any questions or problems with your Lyumjev 200 units/mL KwikPen, call your \nhealthcare professional for help or contact your local Lilly affiliate.  \n \nDocument Revision Date:  \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
