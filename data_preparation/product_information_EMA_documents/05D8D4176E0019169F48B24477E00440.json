NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCerezyme 400 Units Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 400 units* of imiglucerase**.  \n \nAfter reconstitution, the solution contains 40 units (approximately 1.0 mg) of imiglucerase per ml \n(400 U/10 ml).   \n \n* An enzyme unit (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of one \nmicromole of the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) per minute at \n37°C. \n** Imiglucerase is a modified form of human acid β-glucosidase and is produced by recombinant \nDNA technology using a mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture, with mannose \nmodification for targeting macrophages. \n \nExcipients: \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \nThis medicinal product contains sodium and is administered in 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous \nsolution (see section 6.6).  After reconstitution, the solution contains 1.24 mmol sodium \n(400 U/10 mL). To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \nCerezyme is a white to off-white powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCerezyme (imiglucerase) is indicated for use as long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients \nwith a confirmed diagnosis of non-neuronopathic (Type 1) or chronic neuronopathic (Type 3) \nGaucher disease who exhibit clinically significant non-neurological manifestations of the disease. \n \nThe non-neurological manifestations of Gaucher disease include one or more of the following \nconditions: \n• anaemia after exclusion of other causes, such as iron deficiency \n• thrombocytopenia \n• bone disease after exclusion of other causes such as Vitamin D deficiency \n• hepatomegaly or splenomegaly \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nDisease management should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the treatment of Gaucher \ndisease. \n \nPosology \n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nDue to the heterogeneity and the multi-systemic nature of Gaucher disease, dosage should be \nindividualised for each patient based on a comprehensive evaluation of all clinical manifestations of \nthe disease. Once individual patient response for all relevant clinical manifestations is well-\nestablished, dosages and frequency of administration may be adjusted with the goal to either maintain \nalready reached optimal parameters for all clinical manifestations or further improve those clinical \nparameters which have not yet been normalised. \n \nA range of dosage regimens has proven effective towards some or all of the non-neurological \nmanifestations of the disease. Initial doses of 60 U/kg of body weight once every 2 weeks have shown \nimprovement in haematological and visceral parameters within 6 months of therapy and continued use \nhas either stopped progression of or improved bone disease. Administration of doses as low as \n15 U/kg of body weight once every 2 weeks has been shown to improve haematological parameters \nand organomegaly, but not bone parameters. The usual frequency of infusion is once every 2 weeks; \nthis is the frequency of infusion for which the most data are available.  \n \nPaediatric population \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for the paediatric population. \n \nThe efficacy of Cerezyme on neurological symptoms of chronic neuronopathic Gaucher patients has \nnot been established and no special dosage regimen can be recommended for these manifestations \n(see section 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAfter reconstitution and dilution, the preparation is administered by intravenous infusion. At initial \ninfusions, Cerezyme should be administered at a rate not exceeding 0.5 unit per kg body weight per \nminute. At subsequent administrations, infusion rate may be increased but should not exceed 1 unit \nper kg body weight per minute. Infusion rate increases should occur under supervision of a health care \nprofessional. \n \nInfusion of Cerezyme at home may be considered for patients who are tolerating their infusions well \nfor several months.. Decision to have patient move to home infusion should be made after evaluation \nand recommendation by the treating physician. Infusion of Cerezyme by the patient or caregiver at \nhome requires training by a health care professional in a clinical setting. The patient or caregiver will \nbe instructed in infusion technique and the keeping of a treatment diary. Patients experiencing adverse \nevents during the infusion need to immediately stop the infusion process and seek the attention of a \nhealthcare professional. Subsequent infusions may need to occur in a clinical setting. Dose and \ninfusion rate should remain constant while at home, and not be changed without supervision of a \nhealth care professional. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \nMedical or healthcare professionals are encouraged to register Gaucher patients, including those with \nchronic neuronopathic manifestations of the disease, in the “ICGG Gaucher Registry” (see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nCurrent data using a screening ELISA followed by a confirmatory radioimmunoprecipitation assay, \nsuggest that, during the first year of therapy, IgG antibodies to imiglucerase are formed in \napproximately 15% of the treated patients. It appears that patients who will develop IgG antibody are \nmost likely to do so within 6 months of treatment and will rarely develop antibodies to Cerezyme after \n12 months of therapy. It is suggested that patients suspected of a decreased response to the treatment \nbe monitored periodically for IgG antibody formation to imiglucerase. \n \nPatients with antibody to imiglucerase have a higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions (see \nsection 4.8). If a patient experiences a reaction suggestive of hypersensitivity, subsequent testing for \nimiglucerase antibodies is advised. As with any intravenous protein product, severe allergic-type \nhypersensitivity reactions are possible, but occur uncommonly.  If these reactions occur, immediate \ndiscontinuation of the Cerezyme infusion is recommended and appropriate medical treatment should \nbe initiated.  The current medical standards for emergency treatment are to be observed.  \n \nPatients who have developed antibodies or symptoms of hypersensitivity to Ceredase (alglucerase) \nshould be treated with caution when administering Cerezyme (imiglucerase). \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains sodium and is administered in 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous \nsolution (see section 6.6). To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. This \nmedicinal product contains 280 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 14% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nLimited experience from 150 pregnancy outcomes (primarily based on spontaneous reporting and \nliterature review) is available suggesting that use of Cerezyme is beneficial to control the underlying \nGaucher disease in pregnancy. Furthermore, these data indicate no malformative toxicity for the \nfoetus by Cerezyme, although the statistical evidence is low. Foetal demise has been reported rarely, \nalthough it is not clear whether this related to the use of Cerezyme or to the underlying Gaucher \ndisease. \n \nNo animal studies have been carried out with respect to assessing the effects of Cerezyme on \npregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development. It is not known \nwhether Cerezyme passes via the placenta to the developing foetus. \n \nIn pregnant Gaucher patients and those intending to become pregnant, a risk-benefit treatment \nassessment is required for each pregnancy. Patients who have Gaucher disease and become pregnant \nmay experience a period of increased disease activity during pregnancy and the puerperium. This \nincludes an increased risk of skeletal manifestations, exacerbation of cytopenia, haemorrhage, and an \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nincreased need for transfusion. Both pregnancy and lactation are known to stress maternal calcium \nhomeostasis and to accelerate bone turnover. This may contribute to skeletal disease burden in \nGaucher disease.  \n \nTreatment naïve women should be advised to consider commencing therapy prior to conception in \norder to attain optimal health. In women receiving Cerezyme treatment continuation throughout \npregnancy should be considered. Close monitoring of the pregnancy and clinical manifestations of \nGaucher disease is necessary for the individualization of dose according to the patient’s needs and \ntherapeutic response.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether this active substance is excreted in human milk, however, the enzyme is likely \nto be digested in the child’s gastrointestinal tract \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCerezyme has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency (common (≥1/100 to <1/10),  \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100) and rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000)) in the table below. Within each \nfrequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  \n \nMedDRA System Organ \nClass \n\nCommon Uncommon Rare \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\n Dizziness, headache, \nparaesthesia* \n\n \n\nCardiac disorders  Tachycardia*, \ncyanosis* \n\n \n\nVascular disorders  Flushing*,  \nhypotension* \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDyspnoea*, coughing*   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n Vomiting, nausea, \nabdominal \ncramping, diarrhoea \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity \nreactions \n\n Anaphylactoid \nreactions \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nUrticaria/angioedema*, \npruritus*, rash* \n\n  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue  \ndisorders \n\n Arthralgia, \nbackache* \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n Infusion site \ndiscomfort, infusion \nsite burning, \ninfusion site \nswelling, injection \nsite sterile abscess, \nchest discomfort*, \nfever, rigors, fatigue \n\n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n \nSymptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity (* marked in the table above) have been noted, overall in \napproximately 3% of the patients. Onset of such symptoms has occurred during or shortly after \ninfusions.  These symptoms generally respond to treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.  \nPatients should be advised to discontinue infusion of the product and contact their physician if these \nsymptoms occur. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. In patients dosages up to 240 U/kg body weight once every \ntwo weeks have been used. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Enzymes-Imiglucerase (recombinant macrophage targeted β-\nglucocerebrosidase), ATC code: A16AB02. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nGaucher disease is a rare recessively inherited metabolic disorder that results from a deficiency of the \nlysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase. This enzyme breaks down glucosylceramide, a key component \nof the lipid structure of cell membranes, into glucose and ceramide. In individuals with Gaucher \ndisease, glucosylceramide degradation is insufficient, leading to accumulation of large quantities of \nthis substrate within the lysosomes of macrophages (termed ‘Gaucher cells’), leading to widespread \nsecondary pathology.  \n \nGaucher cells are typically found in liver, spleen and bone marrow and occasionally in lung, kidney \nand intestine. Clinically, Gaucher disease is a heterogeneous phenotypic spectrum. The most frequent \ndisease manifestations are hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and skeletal pathology, \nThe skeletal abnormalities are frequently the most debilitating and disabling features of Gaucher \ndisease. These skeletal manifestations include bone marrow infiltration, osteonecrosis, bone pain and \nbone crises, osteopenia and osteoporosis, pathological fractures, and growth impairment. Gaucher \ndisease is associated with increased glucose production and increased resting energy expenditure rate, \nwhich may contribute to fatigue and cachexia. Patients with Gaucher disease may also have a low \ngrade inflammatory profile. In addition, Gaucher disease has been associated with an increased risk of \nimmunoglobulin abnormalities such as hyperimmunoglobulinemia, polyclonal gammopathy, \nmonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma. The natural \nhistory of Gaucher disease usually shows progression, with the risk of irreversible complications \narising in various organs over time. The clinical manifestations of Gaucher disease can adversely \naffect quality of life. Gaucher disease is associated with increased morbidity and early mortality.  \nSigns and symptoms presenting in childhood typically represent more severe Gaucher disease. In \nchildren, Gaucher disease can lead to growth retardation and delayed puberty. \n \nPulmonary hypertension is a known complication of Gaucher disease. Patients who have undergone a \nsplenectomy have an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension. Cerezyme therapy reduces the \nrequirement for splenectomy in most cases and early treatment with Cerezyme has been associated \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 7 \n\nwith a reduced risk of pulmonary hypertension. Routine evaluation to detect the presence of \npulmonary hypertension after diagnosis of Gaucher disease and over time is recommended. Patients \ndiagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, in particular, should receive adequate doses of Cerezyme to \nensure control of underlying Gaucher disease as well as be evaluated for the need of additional \npulmonary hypertension specific treatments.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nImiglucerase (recombinant macrophage targeted acid ß-glucosidase) replaces the deficient enzyme \nactivity, hydrolysing glucosylceramide, thus correcting initial pathophysiology and preventing \nsecondary pathology. Cerezyme reduces spleen and liver size, improves or normalises \nthrombocytopenia and anaemia, improves or normalises bone mineral density and bone marrow \nburden, and reduces or eliminates bone pain and bone crises. Cerezyme reduces resting energy \nexpenditure rate. Cerezyme has been shown to improve both mental and physical aspects in the \nquality of life of Gaucher disease. Cerezyme decreases chitotriosidase, a biomarker for \nglucosylceramide accumulation in macrophages and response to treatment. In children, Cerezyme has \nbeen shown to enable normal pubertal development, and to induce catch-up growth, leading to normal \nheight and bone mineral density in adulthood. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe rate and extent of response to Cerezyme treatment is dose-dependent. Generally, improvements in \norgan systems with a faster turnover rate, such as the haematological, can be noted far more rapidly \nthan in those with a slower turnover, such as the bone. \nIn an ICGG Gaucher Registry analysis of a large cohort of patients (n=528) with Gaucher disease \ntype 1, a time- and dose-dependent effect for Cerezyme was observed for haematological and visceral \nparameters (platelet count, haemoglobin concentration, spleen and liver volume) within the dose \nrange of 15, 30 and 60 U/kg body weight once every 2 weeks. Patients treated with 60 U/kg body \nweight every 2 weeks showed a faster improvement and a greater maximum treatment effect as \ncompared to patients receiving the lower doses.  \n \nSimilarly, in an ICGG Gaucher Registry analysis of bone mineral density using dual-energy X-ray \nabsorptiometry (DXA) in 342 patients, after 8 years of treatment normal bone mineral density was \nachieved with a Cerezyme dose of 60 U/kg body weight once every 2 weeks, but not with lower doses \nof 15 and 30 U/kg body weight once every 2 weeks (Wenstrup et al, 2007).   \n \nIn a study investigating 2 cohorts of patients treated with a median dose of 80 U/kg body weight every \n4 weeks and a median dose of 30 U/kg body weight every 4 weeks, among the patients with bone \nmarrow burden score ≥ 6, more patients in the higher dose cohort (33%; n=22) achieved a decrease in \nthe score of 2 points after 24 months of Cerezyme treatment compared with patients in the lower dose \ncohort (10%; n=13) (de Fost et al, 2006). \n  \nTreatment with Cerezyme at a dose of 60 U/kg body weight once every 2 weeks, showed \nimprovement in bone pain as early as 3 months, decrease in bone crises within 12 months, and \nimprovement in bone mineral density after 24 months of treatment (Sims et al, 2008). \n \nThe usual frequency of infusion is once every 2 weeks (see section 4.2). Maintenance therapy every 4 \nweeks (Q4) at the same cumulative dose as the bi-weekly (Q2) dose has been studied in adult patients \nwith stable residual Gaucher disease type 1. Changes from baseline in hemoglobin, platelets, liver and \nspleen volumes, bone crisis, and bone disease comprised a predefined composite endpoint; \nachievement or maintenance of established Gaucher disease therapeutic goals for the hematologic and \nvisceral parameters comprised an additional endpoint. Sixty-three percent of Q4- and 81% of Q2-\ntreated patients met the composite endpoint at Month 24; the difference was not statistically \nsignificant based on the 95% CI (-0.357, 0.058). Eighty-nine percent of Q4- and 100% of Q2-treated \npatients met the therapeutic goals-based endpoint; the difference was not statistically significant based \n\n\n\n 8 \n\non the 95% CI (-0.231, 0.060). A Q4 infusion regimen may be a therapeutic option for some adult \npatients with stable residual Gaucher disease type 1, but clinical data are limited.  \n \nNo controlled clinical studies have been conducted on the efficacy of Cerezyme on neurological \nmanifestations of the disease. Therefore no conclusions on the effect of enzyme replacement therapy \non the neurological manifestations of the disease can be drawn. \n \nMedical or healthcare professionals are encouraged to register Gaucher patients, including those with \nchronic neuronopathic manifestations of the disease, in the “ICGG Gaucher Registry”. Patient data \nwill be anonymously collected in this Registry. The objectives of the “ICGG Gaucher Registry” are to \nenhance the understanding of Gaucher disease and to evaluate the effectiveness of enzyme \nreplacement therapy, ultimately leading to improvement in the safe and efficacious use of Cerezyme. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDuring 1 hour intravenous infusions of 4 doses (7.5, 15, 30, 60 U/kg) of imiglucerase, steady-state \nenzymatic activity was achieved by 30 minutes. Following infusion, plasma enzymatic activity \ndeclined rapidly with a half-life ranging from 3.6 to 10.4 minutes. Plasma clearance ranged from 9.8 \nto 20.3 ml/min/kg, (mean ± S.D, 14.5 ± 4.0 ml/min/kg). The volume of distribution corrected for \nweight ranged from 0.09 to 0.15 l/kg (mean ± S.D 0.12 ± 0.02 l/kg). These variables do not appear to \nbe influenced by dose or duration of infusion, however, only 1 or 2 patients were studied at each dose \nlevel and infusion rate. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nMannitol,  \nsodium citrate (to adjust pH), \ncitric acid monohydrate (to adjust pH),  \npolysorbate 80. \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other \nmedicinal products. \n \n6.3 Shelf life \n \nUnopened vials: \n3 years \n \nDiluted solution: \nFrom a microbiological safety point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should \nnot be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C under protection from light. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C).  \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n \nFor storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nCerezyme is supplied in type I borosilicate (clear) glass 20 ml vials. The closure consists of a \nsiliconised butyl stopper with a tamper proof flip-off cap. \n \nTo provide sufficient volume to allow accurate dispensing, each vial is formulated to contain an \noverfill of 0.6 ml. \n \nPack sizes: 1, 5 or 25 vials per carton. \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nEach vial of Cerezyme is for single use only.  \n \nThe powder for concentrate for solution for infusion has to be reconstituted with water for injections, \ndiluted with 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution and then administered by intravenous \ninfusion. \n \nDetermine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient's dosage regimen \nand remove the vials from the refrigerator. \n \nOccasionally, small dosage adjustments may be made to avoid discarding partially used vials. \nDosages may be rounded to the nearest full vial, as long as the monthly administered dosage remains \nsubstantially unaltered. \n \nUse Aseptic Technique  \n \nReconstitution \nReconstitute each vial with 10.2 ml water for injections; avoid forceful impact of water for injections \non the powder and, by mixing gently, avoid foaming of the solution. The reconstituted volume is  \n10.6 ml. The pH of the reconstituted solution is approximately 6.1. \n \nAfter reconstitution it is a clear, colourless liquid, free from foreign matter. The reconstituted solution \nmust be further diluted. Before further dilution, visually inspect the reconstituted solution in each vial \nfor foreign particles and discoloration. Do not use vials exhibiting foreign particles or discoloration. \nAfter reconstitution, promptly dilute vials and do not store for subsequent use. \n \nDilution \nThe reconstituted solution contains 40 units imiglucerase per ml. The reconstituted volume allows \naccurate withdrawal of 10.0 ml (equal to 400 units) from each vial. Withdraw 10.0 ml reconstituted \nsolution from each vial and combine the withdrawn volumes. Then dilute the combined volumes with \n0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution to a total volume of 100 to 200 ml. Mix the infusion \nsolution gently. \n \nAdministration \nIt is recommended to administer the diluted solution through an in-line low protein-binding 0.2 µm \nfilter to remove any protein particles. This will not lead to any loss of imiglucerase activity. It is \nrecommended that the diluted solution be administered within 3 hours. The product diluted in 0.9% \nsodium chloride intravenous solution will retain chemical stability if stored up to 24 hours at 2°C and \n8°C under protection from light; but microbiological safety will depend on the reconstitution and \ndilution having been performed aseptically. \n \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nCerezyme contains no preservatives. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n 19 \n\n Package leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nCerezyme 400 Units powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nImiglucerase \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Cerezyme is and what it is used for. \n2. What you need to know before you are given Cerezyme. \n3. How Cerezyme is given. \n4. Possible side effects. \n5. How Cerezyme is stored. \n6. Contents of the pack and other information.  \n \n \n1. What Cerezyme is and what it is used for \n \nCerezyme contains the active substance imiglucerase and is used to treat patients who have a \nconfirmed diagnosis of Type I or Type 3 Gaucher disease, who show signs of the disease such as: \nanaemia (low number of red blood cells), a tendency to bleed easily (due to low numbers of platelets – \na type of blood cell), spleen or liver enlargement or bone disease. \n \nPeople with Gaucher disease have low levels of an enzyme called acid β-glucosidase. This enzyme \nhelps the body control levels of glucosylceramide. Glucosylceramide is a natural substance in the \nbody, made of sugar and fat. In Gaucher disease glucosylceramide levels can get too high. \n \nCerezyme is an artificial enzyme called imiglucerase - this can replace the natural enzyme acid \nβ-glucosidase which is lacking or not active enough in patients with Gaucher disease. \n \nThe information in this leaflet applies to all patient groups including children, adolescents, adults and \nthe elderly. \n \n \n2.    What you need to know before you are given Cerezyme \n \nDo not use Cerezyme \n- if you are allergic to imiglucerase or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor  or pharmacist before using Cerezyme: \n- if you are treated with Cerezyme, you may experience an allergic reaction while you are being \n\ngiven the medicine or shortly after. If you experience a reaction like this, you should tell your \ndoctor immediately. Your doctor may test if you have an allergic reaction to imiglucerase. \n\n- some patients with Gaucher disease have high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary \nhypertension). The cause can be unknown, or it can be due to heart, lung or liver problems. It \ncan occur whether the patient is treated with Cerezyme or not. But, if you suffer with any \nshortness of breath you should tell your doctor. \n\n\n\n 20 \n\n \nOther medicines and Cerezyme \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nCerezyme should not be given as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same infusion (drip). \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Cautious use of Cerezyme during \npregnancy and breastfeeding is recommended. \n \nCerezyme contains sodium  \nThis medicine contains sodium and is administered in 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution. To \nbe taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. This medicine contains 280 mg \nsodium (main component of cooking/table salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 14 % of the \nrecommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How Cerezyme is given \n \nInstructions for proper use \nCerezyme is given through a drip into a vein (by intravenous infusion). \n \nIt is supplied as a powder which will be mixed with sterile water before it is given. \n \nCerezyme is only used under the supervision of a doctor who is knowledgeable in the treatment of \nGaucher disease. Your doctor may advise that you can be treated at home provided you meet certain \ncriteria. Please contact your doctor if you would like to be treated at home. \n \nYour dose will be specific to you. Your doctor will work out your dose based on how severe your \nsymptoms are, and other factors. The recommended dose is 60 units/kg body weight given once every \n2 weeks.  \n \nYour doctor will keep a close check on your response to your treatment, and may change your dose \n(up or down) until he/she finds the best dose to control your symptoms.  \n \nOnce this dose is found your doctor will still keep a check on your responses to make sure you are \nusing the right dose. This might be every 6 to 12 months. \n \nThere is no information on the effect of Cerezyme on brain-based symptoms of patients with chronic \nneuronopathic Gaucher disease. Therefore no special dosage regimen can be recommended. \n \nThe ICGG Gaucher Registry \nYou can ask your doctor to register your patient information into the “ICGG Gaucher Registry”. The \naims of this Registry are to increase the understanding of Gaucher disease and to check how well \nenzyme replacement therapy, like Cerezyme, works. This should lead to improvement in the safe and \neffective use of Cerezyme.  Your patient data will be registered anonymously– nobody will know it is \ninformation about you. \n \nIf you use more Cerezyme than you should \nThere are no cases of overdose of Cerezyme reported. \n \nIf you forget to use Cerezyme \nIf you have missed an infusion, please contact your doctor. \n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nCommon ( may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- breathlessness \n- coughing \n- hives/ localised swelling of the skin or lining of the mouth or throat  \n- itching \n- rash \n \nUncommon ( may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n- dizziness \n- headache \n- a sensation of tingling, pricking, burning or numbness of the skin \n- increased heart rate \n- bluish skin \n- flushing \n- fall in blood pressure \n- vomiting \n- nausea \n- abdominal cramping \n- diarrhoea \n- pain in the joints \n- infusion site discomfort \n- infusion site burning \n- infusion site swelling \n- injection site sterile abscess \n- chest discomfort \n- fever \n- rigors \n- fatigue \n- backache \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): \n- anaphylactoid reactions \n \nSome side effects were seen primarily while patients were being given the medicine or shortly after. \nThese have included itching, flushing, hives/localised swelling of the skin or lining of the mouth or \nthroat, chest discomfort, increased heart rate, bluish skin, breathlessness, a sensation of tingling, \npricking, burning or numbness of the skin, fall in blood pressure and backache.  If you experience any \nof these symptoms, please tell your doctor immediately. You may need to be given additional \nmedicines to prevent an allergic reaction (e.g. antihistamines and/or corticosteroids).  \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.

After reconstitution, each vial of Cerezyme contains 400 \nunits of imiglucerase in 10.0 ml (40 units per ml). \n\n \nDetermine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient's dosage regimen \nand remove the vials from the refrigerator. \n \nUse Aseptic Technique  \n \nReconstitution \nReconstitute each vial with 10.2 ml water for injections; avoid forceful impact of water for injections \non the powder and, by mixing gently, avoid foaming of the solution. The reconstituted volume is  \n10.6 ml. The pH of the reconstituted solution is approximately 6.1. \n \nAfter reconstitution it is a clear, colourless liquid, free from foreign matter. The reconstituted solution \nmust be further diluted. Before further dilution, visually inspect the reconstituted solution in each vial \nfor foreign particles and discoloration. Do not use vials exhibiting foreign particles or discoloration. \nAfter reconstitution, promptly dilute vials and do not store for subsequent use. \n \nDilution \nThe reconstituted solution contains 40 units imiglucerase per ml. The reconstituted volume allows \naccurate withdrawal of 10.0 ml (equal to 400 units) from each vial. Withdraw 10.0 ml reconstituted \nsolution from each vial and combine the withdrawn volumes. Then dilute the combined volumes with \n0.9% sodium chloride intravenous solution to a total volume of 100 to 200 ml. Mix the infusion \nsolution gently. \n \nAdministration \nIt is recommended to administer the diluted solution through an in-line low protein-binding 0.2 µm \nfilter to remove any protein particles. This will not lead to any loss of imiglucerase activity. It is \nrecommended that the diluted solution be administered within 3 hours. The product diluted in 0.9% \n\nhttp://www.emea.europa.eu/\nhttp://www.emea.europa.eu/\n\n\n 25 \n\nsodium chloride intravenous solution will retain chemical stability if stored up to 24 hours at 2°C and \n8°C under protection from light; but microbiological safety will depend on the reconstitution and \ndilution having been performed aseptically. \n \nCerezyme contains no preservatives. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in \naccordance with local requirements. \n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
