NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nEmselex 7.5 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach tablet contains 7.5 mg of darifenacin (as hydrobromide) \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged-release tablet \n \nWhite round, convex tablet, debossed with \u201cDF\u201d on one side and \u201c7.5\u201d on the reverse. \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of urge incontinence and/or increased urinary frequency and urgency as may \noccur in adult patients with overactive bladder syndrome. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg daily. After 2 weeks of starting therapy, patients should be \nreassessed. For those patients requiring greater symptom relief, the dose may be increased to 15 mg \ndaily, based on individual response. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \nThe recommended starting dose for the elderly is 7.5 mg daily. After 2 weeks of starting therapy, \npatients should be reassessed for efficacy and safety. For those patients who have an acceptable \ntolerability profile but require greater symptom relief, the dose may be increased to 15 mg daily, based \non individual response (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nEmselex is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A). However, \nthere is a risk of increased exposure in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) should only be treated if the benefit \noutweighs the risk, and the dose should be restricted to 7.5 mg daily (see section 5.2). Emselex is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) (see section 4.3). \n \nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 or \nmoderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIn patients receiving substances that are potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, terbinafine, \nquinidine and cimetidine, treatment should start with the 7.5 mg dose. The dose may be titrated to \n15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response provided the dose is well tolerated. However, \ncaution should be exercised. \n \nIn patients receiving substances that are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, grapefruit \njuice and erythromycin, the recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg daily. The dose may be titrated to \n15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response provided the dose is well tolerated. However, \ncaution should be exercised. \n \nMethod of administration \nEmselex is for oral use. The tablets should be taken once daily with liquid. They can be taken with or \nwithout food, and must be swallowed whole and not chewed, divided or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nEmselex is contraindicated in patients with: \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Urinary retention. \n- Gastric retention. \n- Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. \n- Myasthenia gravis. \n- Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). \n- Severe ulcerative colitis. \n- Toxic megacolon. \n- Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEmselex should be administered with caution to patients with autonomic neuropathy, hiatus hernia, \nclinically significant bladder outflow obstruction, risk for urinary retention, severe constipation or \ngastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis. \n \nEmselex should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nOther causes of frequent urination (heart failure or renal disease) should be assessed before treatment \nwith Emselex. If urinary tract infection is present, an appropriate antibacterial therapy should be \nstarted. \n \nEmselex should be used with caution in patients with risk of decreased gastrointestinal motility, \ngastro-oesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking medicinal products (such as oral \nbisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate oesophagitis. \n \nSafety and efficacy have not yet been established in patients with a neurogenic cause for detrusor over \nactivity. \n \nCaution should be used when prescribing antimuscarinics to patients with pre-existing cardiac \ndiseases. \n \nAs with other antimuscarinics, patients should be instructed to discontinue Emselex and seek \nimmediate medical attention if they experience oedema of the tongue or laropharynx, or difficulty \nbreathing (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on darifenacin \nDarifenacin metabolism is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4. Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes may increase darifenacin exposure. \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn patients receiving substances that are potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine, terbinafine, \ncimetidine and quinidine) the recommended starting dose should be 7.5 mg daily. The dose may be \ntitrated to 15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response provided the dose is well tolerated. \nConcomitant treatment with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors results in an increase in exposure (e.g. of 33% \nwith 20 mg paroxetine at the 30 mg dose of darifenacin). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nDarifenacin should not be used together with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.3) such as \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir), ketoconazole and itraconazole. Potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors \nsuch as ciclosporin and verapamil should also be avoided. Co-administration of darifenacin 7.5 mg \nwith the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg resulted in a 5-fold increase in steady-state \ndarifenacin AUC. In subjects who are poor metabolisers, darifenacin exposure increased \napproximately 10-fold. Due to a greater contribution of CYP3A4 after higher darifenacin doses, the \nmagnitude of the effect is expected to be even more pronounced when combining ketoconazole with \ndarifenacin 15 mg. \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, \ntelithromycin, fluconazole and grapefruit juice, the recommended starting dose of darifenacin should \nbe 7.5 mg daily. The dose may be titrated to 15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response \nprovided the dose is well tolerated. Darifenacin AUC24 and Cmax from 30 mg once daily dosing in \nsubjects who are extensive metabolisers were 95% and 128% higher when erythromycin (moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitor) was co-administered with darifenacin than when darifenacin was taken alone. \n \nEnzyme inducers \nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, barbiturates and St \nJohn\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to decrease the plasma concentrations of darifenacin. \n \nEffects of darifenacin on other medicinal products \nCYP2D6 substrates \nDarifenacin is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2D6. Caution should be exercised when \ndarifenacin is used concomitantly with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by \nCYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine, or tricyclic \nantidepressants such as imipramine. The effects of darifenacin on the metabolism of CYP2D6 \nsubstrates are mainly clinically relevant for CYP2D6 substrates which are individually dose titrated. \n \nCYP3A4 substrates \nDarifenacin treatment resulted in a modest increase in the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate \nmidazolam. However the data available do not indicate that darifenacin changes either midazolam \nclearance or bioavailability. It can therefore be concluded that darifenacin administration does not alter \nthe pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates in vivo. The interaction with midazolam lacks clinical \nrelevance, and therefore no dose adjustment is needed for CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nWarfarin \nStandard therapeutic prothrombin time monitoring for warfarin should be continued. The effect of \nwarfarin on prothrombin time was not altered when co-administered with darifenacin. \n \nDigoxin \nTherapeutic drug monitoring for digoxin should be performed when initiating and ending darifenacin \ntreatment as well as changing the darifenacin dose. Darifenacin 30 mg once daily (two times greater \nthan the recommended daily dose) co-administered with digoxin at steady state resulted in a small \n\n\n\n5 \n\nincrease in digoxin exposure (AUC: 16% and Cmax: 20%). The increase in digoxin exposure could be \ncaused by competition between darifenacin and digoxin for P-glycoprotein. Other transporter-related \ninteractions cannot be excluded. \n \nAntimuscarinic agents \nAs with any other antimuscarinic agents, concomitant use of medicinal products that possess \nantimuscarinic properties, such as oxybutynin, tolterodine and flavoxate, may result in more \npronounced therapeutic and side effects. The potentiation of anticholinergic effects with anti-\nparkinson agents and tricyclic antidepressants may also occur if antimuscarinic agents are used \nconcurrently with such medicinal products. However, no studies involving the interaction with anti-\nparkinson agents and tricyclic antidepressants have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of darifenacin in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown toxicity to parturition (for details, see section 5.3). Emselex is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDarifenacin is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether darifenacin is excreted in human \nmilk. A risk to the nursing child cannot be excluded. A decision whether to avoid breast-feeding or to \nabstain from Emselex therapy during lactation should be based on a benefit and risk comparison. \n \nFertility \nThere are no human fertility data for darifenacin. Darifenacin had no effect on male or female fertility \nin rats or any effect in the reproductive organs of either sex in rats and dogs (for details, see section \n5.3). Women of child bearing potential should be made aware of the lack of fertility data, and Emselex \nshould only be given after consideration of individual risks and benefits. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAs with other antimuscarinic agents, Emselex may produce effects such as dizziness, blurred vision, \ninsomnia and somnolence. Patients experiencing these side effects should not drive or use machines. \nFor Emselex, these side effects have been reported to be uncommon. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nConsistent with the pharmacological profile, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were dry \nmouth (20.2% and 35% for the 7.5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively, 18.7% after flexible dose \ntitration, and 8% - 9% for placebo) and constipation (14.8% and 21% for the 7.5 mg and 15 mg dose, \nrespectively, 20.9% after flexible dose titration, and 5.4% - 7.9% for placebo). Anticholinergic effects, \nin general, are dose-dependent. \n \nHowever, the patient discontinuation rates due to these adverse reactions were low (dry mouth: 0% - \n0.9% and constipation: 0.6% - 2.2% for darifenacin, depending on the dose; and 0% and 0.3% for \nplacebo, for dry mouth and constipation, respectively). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within \neach frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions with Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg prolonged-release tablets \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nInfections and infestations \nUncommon Urinary tract infection \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon Insomnia, thinking abnormal \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Headache \nUncommon Dizziness, dysgeusia, somnolence \nEye disorders \nCommon Dry eye \nUncommon Visual disturbance, including vision blurred \nVascular disorders \nUncommon Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Nasal dryness \nUncommon Dyspnoea, cough, rhinitis \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Constipation, dry mouth \nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia \nUncommon Flatulence, diarrhoea, mouth ulceration \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon Rash, dry skin, pruritus, hyperhidrosis \nNot known Angioedema \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon Urinary retention, urinary tract disorder, bladder pain \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon Erectile dysfunction, vaginitis \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon Oedema peripheral, asthenia, face oedema, oedema \nInvestigations \nUncommon Aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine \n\naminotransferase increased \nInjury, poisoning, and procedural complications \nUncommon Injury \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nIn the pivotal clinical trials with doses of Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg, adverse reactions were reported \nas presented in the table above. Most of the adverse reactions were of mild or moderate intensity and \ndid not result in discontinuation in the majority of the patients. \n \nTreatment with Emselex may possibly mask symptoms associated with gallbladder disease. However, \nthere was no association between the occurrence of adverse events related to the biliary system in \ndarifenacin-treated patients and increasing age. \n \nThe incidence of adverse reactions with the doses of Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg decreased during the \ntreatment period up to 6 months. A similar trend is also seen for the discontinuation rates. \n \nPost-marketing experience \nThe following events have been reported in association with darifenacin use in worldwide post-\nmarketing experience: generalised hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, depressed \nmood/mood alterations, hallucination. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the \nworldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events cannot be estimated from the available \ndata. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n\n\n7 \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEmselex has been administered in clinical trials at doses up to 75 mg (five times maximum therapeutic \ndose). The most common adverse reactions seen were dry mouth, constipation, headache, dyspepsia \nand nasal dryness. However, overdose with darifenacin can potentially lead to severe anticholinergic \neffects and should be treated accordingly. Therapy should be aimed at reversing the anticholinergic \nsymptoms under careful medical supervision. The use of agents such as physostigmine can assist in \nreversing such symptoms. \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, drugs for urinary frequency and incontinence; ATC code: \nG04BD10. \n \nMechanism of action  \nDarifenacin is a selective muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist (M3 SRA) in vitro. The M3 receptor is \nthe major subtype that controls urinary bladder muscle contraction. It is not known whether this \nselectivity for the M3 receptor translates into any clinical advantage when treating symptoms of \noveractive bladder syndrome. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nCystometric studies performed with darifenacin in patients with involuntary bladder contractions \nshowed increased bladder capacity, increased volume threshold for unstable contractions and \ndiminished frequency of unstable detrusor contractions. \n \nTreatment with Emselex administered at dosages of 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily has been investigated in \nfour double-blind, Phase III, randomised, controlled clinical studies in male and female patients with \nsymptoms of overactive bladder. As seen in Table 2 below, a pooled analysis of 3 of the studies for the \ntreatment with both Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg provided a statistically significant improvement in the \nprimary endpoint, reduction in incontinence episodes, versus placebo. \n \nTable 2: Pooled analysis of data from three Phase III clinical studies assessing fixed doses of 7.5 mg \nand 15 mg Emselex \n \n\nDose N Incontinence episodes per week 95% CI P value2 \nBaseline \n(median) \n\nWeek 12 \n(median) \n\nChange from \nbaseline \n(median) \n\nDifferences \nfrom placebo1 \n\n(median) \n\nEmselex \n7.5 mg \nonce daily \n\n335 16.0 4.9 -8.8 (-68%) -2.0 (-3.6, -0.7) 0.004 \n\nPlacebo 271 16.6 7.9 -7.0 (-54%) -- -- -- \n        \nEmselex \n15 mg \nonce daily \n\n330 16.9 4.1 -10.6 (-77%) -3.2 (-4.5, -2.0) <0.001 \n\nPlacebo 384 16.6 6.4 -7.5 (-58%) -- -- -- \n1 Hodges Lehmann estimate: median difference from placebo in change from baseline \n\n\n\n8 \n\n2 Stratified Wilcoxon test for difference from placebo. \n \nEmselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses significantly reduced both the severity and number of urinary \nurgency episodes and the number of micturitions, while significantly increasing the mean volume \nvoided from baseline. \n \nEmselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg were associated with statistically significant improvements over placebo in \nsome aspects of quality of life as measured by the Kings Health Questionnaire including incontinence \nimpact, role limitations, social limitations and severity measures. \n \nFor both doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg, the percentage median reduction from baseline in the number of \nincontinence episodes per week was similar between males and females. The observed differences \nfrom placebo for males in terms of percentage and absolute reductions in incontinence episodes was \nlower than for females. \n \nThe effect of treatment with 15 mg and 75 mg of darifenacin on QT/QTc interval was evaluated in a \nstudy in 179 healthy adults (44% male: 56% females) aged 18 to 65 for 6 days (to steady state). \nTherapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of darifenacin resulted in no increase in QT/QTc interval \nprolongation from baseline compared to placebo at maximum darifenacin exposure. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDarifenacin is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Due to genetic differences, about 7% of the \nCaucasians lack the CYP2D6 enzyme and are said to be poor metabolisers. A few percent of the \npopulation have increased CYP2D6 enzyme levels (ultrafast metabolisers). The information below \napplies to subjects who have normal CYP2D6 activity (extensive metabolisers) unless otherwise \nstated. \n \nAbsorption \nDue to extensive first-pass metabolism darifenacin has a bioavailability of approximately 15% and \n19% after 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily doses at steady state. Maximum plasma levels are reached \napproximately 7 hours after administration of the prolonged-release tablets and steady-state plasma \nlevels are achieved by the sixth day of administration. At steady state, peak-to-trough fluctuations in \ndarifenacin concentrations are small (PTF: 0.87 for 7.5 mg and 0.76 for 15 mg), thereby maintaining \ntherapeutic plasma levels over the dosing interval. Food had no effect on darifenacin pharmacokinetics \nduring multiple-dose administration of prolonged-release tablets. \n \nDistribution \nDarifenacin is a lipophilic base and is 98% bound to plasma proteins (primarily to alpha-1-acid-\nglycoprotein). The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is estimated to be 163 litres. \n \nMetabolism \nDarifenacin is extensively metabolised by the liver following oral administration. \n \nDarifenacin undergoes significant metabolism by cytochrome CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in the liver and \nby CYP3A4 in the gut wall. The three main metabolic routes are as follows: \nmonohydroxylation in the dihydrobenzofuran ring; \ndihydrobenzofuran ring opening and \nN-dealkylation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen. \n \nThe initial products of the hydroxylation and N-dealkylation pathways are major circulating \nmetabolites but none contribute significantly to the overall clinical effect of darifenacin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darifenacin at steady state are dose-dependent, due to saturation of the \nCYP2D6 enzyme. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nDoubling the darifenacin dose from 7.5 mg to 15 mg result in a 150% increase in steady-state \nexposure. This dose-dependency is probably caused by saturation of the CYP2D6 catalysed \nmetabolism possibly together with some saturation of CYP3A4-mediated gut wall metabolism. \n \nExcretion \nFollowing administration of an oral dose of 14C-darifenacin solution to healthy volunteers, \napproximately 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 40% in the faeces. Only a small \npercentage of the excreted dose was unchanged darifenacin (3%). Estimated darifenacin clearance is \n40 litres/hour. The elimination half-life of darifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately \n13-19 hours. \n \nSpecial patient population \nGender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of patient data indicated that darifenacin exposure was 23% \nlower in males than females (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly patients \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of patient data indicated a trend for clearance to decrease with \nage (19% per decade based on Phase III population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients aged 60\u2013\n89 years), see section 4.2. \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe pharmacokinetics of darifenacin have not been established in the paediatric population. \n \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nThe metabolism of darifenacin in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers is principally mediated by CYP3A4. In \none pharmacokinetic study the steady-state exposure in poor metabolisers was 164% and 99% higher \nduring treatment with 7.5 mg and 15 mg once daily, respectively. However, a population \npharmacokinetic analyses of Phase III data indicated that on average steady-state exposure is 66% \nhigher in poor metabolisers than in extensive metabolisers. There was considerable overlap between \nthe ranges of exposures seen in these two populations (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal insufficiency \nA small study of subjects (n=24) with varying degrees of renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nbetween 10 ml/min and 136 ml/min) given darifenacin 15 mg once daily to steady state demonstrated \nno relationship between renal function and darifenacin clearance (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nDarifenacin pharmacokinetics were investigated in subjects with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate \n(Child Pugh B) impairment of hepatic function given darifenacin 15 mg once daily to steady state. \nMild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of darifenacin. However, protein \nbinding of darifenacin was affected by moderate hepatic impairment. Unbound darifenacin exposure \nwas estimated to be 4.7-fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than subjects with \nnormal hepatic function (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. There were no effects \non fertility in male and female rats treated at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (78 times the AUC0-24h of \nfree plasma concentration at maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). There were no effects \non reproductive organs in either sex in dogs treated for 1 year at oral doses up to 6 mg/kg/day \n(82 times the AUC0-24h of free plasma concentration at MRHD). Darifenacin was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits at doses up to 50 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. At the dose of 50 mg/kg/day in rats \n(59 times the AUC0-24h of free plasma concentration at MRHD), delay in the ossification of the sacral \nand caudal vertebrae was observed. At the dose of 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits (28 times the AUC0-24h of \nfree plasma concentration at MRHD), maternal toxicity and foetotoxicity (increased post implantation \n\n\n\n10 \n\nloss and decreased number of viable foetuses per litter) were observed. In peri and post-natal studies in \nrats, dystocia, increased foetal deaths in utero and toxicity to post-natal development (pup body weight \nand development land marks) were observed at systemic exposure levels up to 11 times the AUC0-24h \nof free plasma concentration at MRHD. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of urge incontinence and/or increased urinary frequency and urgency as may \noccur in adult patients with overactive bladder syndrome. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg daily. After 2 weeks of starting therapy, patients should be \nreassessed. For those patients requiring greater symptom relief, the dose may be increased to 15 mg \ndaily, based on individual response. \n \nElderly patients (\u2265 65 years) \nThe recommended starting dose for the elderly is 7.5 mg daily. After 2 weeks of starting therapy, \npatients should be reassessed for efficacy and safety. For those patients who have an acceptable \ntolerability profile but require greater symptom relief, the dose may be increased to 15 mg daily, based \non individual response (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nEmselex is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety \nand efficacy. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating this population (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A). However, \nthere is a risk of increased exposure in this population (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) should only be treated if the benefit \noutweighs the risk, and the dose should be restricted to 7.5 mg daily (see section 5.2). Emselex is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) (see section 4.3). \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nPatients receiving concomitant treatment with substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 or \nmoderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 \nIn patients receiving substances that are potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, terbinafine, \nquinidine and cimetidine, treatment should start with the 7.5 mg dose. The dose may be titrated to \n15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response provided the dose is well tolerated. However, \ncaution should be exercised. \n \nIn patients receiving substances that are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, grapefruit \njuice and erythromycin, the recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg daily. The dose may be titrated to \n15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response provided the dose is well tolerated. However, \ncaution should be exercised. \n \nMethod of administration \nEmselex is for oral use. The tablets should be taken once daily with liquid. They can be taken with or \nwithout food, and must be swallowed whole and not chewed, divided or crushed. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nEmselex is contraindicated in patients with: \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n- Urinary retention. \n- Gastric retention. \n- Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. \n- Myasthenia gravis. \n- Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). \n- Severe ulcerative colitis. \n- Toxic megacolon. \n- Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nEmselex should be administered with caution to patients with autonomic neuropathy, hiatus hernia, \nclinically significant bladder outflow obstruction, risk for urinary retention, severe constipation or \ngastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis. \n \nEmselex should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nOther causes of frequent urination (heart failure or renal disease) should be assessed before treatment \nwith Emselex. If urinary tract infection is present, an appropriate antibacterial therapy should be \nstarted. \n \nEmselex should be used with caution in patients with risk of decreased gastrointestinal motility, \ngastro-oesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking medicinal products (such as oral \nbisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate oesophagitis. \n \nSafety and efficacy have not yet been established in patients with a neurogenic cause for detrusor over \nactivity. \n \nCaution should be used when prescribing antimuscarinics to patients with pre-existing cardiac \ndiseases. \n \nAs with other antimuscarinics, patients should be instructed to discontinue Emselex and seek \nimmediate medical attention if they experience oedema of the tongue or laropharynx, or difficulty \nbreathing (see section 4.8). \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on darifenacin \nDarifenacin metabolism is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and \nCYP3A4. Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes may increase darifenacin exposure. \n \nCYP2D6 inhibitors \nIn patients receiving substances that are potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine, terbinafine, \ncimetidine and quinidine) the recommended starting dose should be 7.5 mg daily. The dose may be \ntitrated to 15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response provided the dose is well tolerated. \nConcomitant treatment with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors results in an increase in exposure (e.g. of 33% \nwith 20 mg paroxetine at the 30 mg dose of darifenacin). \n \nCYP3A4 inhibitors \nDarifenacin should not be used together with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.3) such as \nprotease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir), ketoconazole and itraconazole. Potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors \nsuch as ciclosporin and verapamil should also be avoided. Co-administration of darifenacin 7.5 mg \nwith the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg resulted in a 5-fold increase in steady-state \ndarifenacin AUC. In subjects who are poor metabolisers, darifenacin exposure increased \napproximately 10-fold. Due to a greater contribution of CYP3A4 after higher darifenacin doses, the \nmagnitude of the effect is expected to be even more pronounced when combining ketoconazole with \ndarifenacin 15 mg. \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, \ntelithromycin, fluconazole and grapefruit juice, the recommended starting dose of darifenacin should \nbe 7.5 mg daily. The dose may be titrated to 15 mg daily to obtain an improved clinical response \nprovided the dose is well tolerated. Darifenacin AUC24 and Cmax from 30 mg once-daily dosing in \nsubjects who are extensive metabolisers were 95% and 128% higher when erythromycin (moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitor) was co-administered with darifenacin than when darifenacin was taken alone. \n \nEnzyme inducers \nSubstances that are inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, barbiturates and St \nJohn\u00b4s wort (Hypericum perforatum) are likely to decrease the plasma concentrations of darifenacin. \n \nEffects of darifenacin on other medicinal products \nCYP2D6 substrates \nDarifenacin is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2D6. Caution should be exercised when \ndarifenacin is used concomitantly with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by \nCYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine, or tricyclic \nantidepressants such as imipramine. The effects of darifenacin on the metabolism of CYP2D6 \nsubstrates are mainly clinically relevant for CYP2D6 substrates which are individually dose titrated. \n \nCYP3A4 substrates \nDarifenacin treatment resulted in a modest increase in the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate \nmidazolam. However the data available do not indicate that darifenacin changes either midazolam \nclearance or bioavailability. It can therefore be concluded that darifenacin administration does not alter \nthe pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates in vivo. The interaction with midazolam lacks clinical \nrelevance, and therefore no dose adjustment is needed for CYP3A4 substrates. \n \nWarfarin \nStandard therapeutic prothrombin time monitoring for warfarin should be continued. The effect of \nwarfarin on prothrombin time was not altered when co-administered with darifenacin. \n \nDigoxin \nTherapeutic drug monitoring for digoxin should be performed when initiating and ending darifenacin \ntreatment as well as changing the darifenacin dose. Darifenacin 30 mg once daily (two times greater \nthan the recommended daily dose) co-administered with digoxin at steady state resulted in a small \n\n\n\n15 \n\nincrease in digoxin exposure (AUC: 16% and Cmax: 20%). The increase in digoxin exposure could be \ncaused by competition between darifenacin and digoxin for P-glycoprotein. Other transporter-related \ninteractions cannot be excluded. \n \nAntimuscarinic agents \nAs with any other antimuscarinic agents, concomitant use of medicinal products that possess \nantimuscarinic properties, such as oxybutynin, tolterodine and flavoxate, may result in more \npronounced therapeutic and side effects. The potentiation of anticholinergic effects with anti-\nparkinson agents and tricyclic antidepressants may also occur if antimuscarinic agents are used \nconcurrently with such medicinal products. However, no studies involving the interaction with anti-\nparkinson agents and tricyclic antidepressants have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are limited amount of data from the use of darifenacin in pregnant women. Studies in animals \nhave shown toxicity to parturition (for details, see section 5.3). Emselex is not recommended during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nDarifenacin is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether darifenacin is excreted in human \nmilk. A risk to the nursing child cannot be excluded. A decision whether to avoid breast-feeding or to \nabstain from Emselex therapy during lactation should be based on a benefit and risk comparison. \n \nFertility \nThere are no human fertility data for darifenacin. Darifenacin had no effect on male or female fertility \nin rats or any effect in the reproductive organs of either sex in rats and dogs (for details, see section \n5.3). Women of child bearing potential should be made aware of the lack of fertility data, and Emselex \nshould only be given after consideration of individual risks and benefits. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAs with other antimuscarinic agents, Emselex may produce effects such as dizziness, blurred vision, \ninsomnia and somnolence. Patients experiencing these side effects should not drive or use machines. \nFor Emselex, these side effects have been reported to be uncommon. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \nConsistent with the pharmacological profile, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were dry \nmouth (20.2% and 35% for the 7.5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively, 18.7% after flexible dose \ntitration, and 8% - 9% for placebo) and constipation (14.8% and 21% for the 7.5 mg and 15 mg dose, \nrespectively, 20.9% after flexible dose titration, and 5.4% - 7.9% for placebo). Anticholinergic effects, \nin general, are dose-dependent. \n \nHowever, the patient discontinuation rates due to these adverse reactions were low (dry mouth: 0% - \n0.9% and constipation: 0.6% - 2.2% for darifenacin, depending on the dose; and 0% and 0.3% for \nplacebo, for dry mouth and constipation, respectively). \n \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reactions are ranked under heading of frequency using the following convention: very \ncommon (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\uf0b31/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\uf0b31/10,000 to \n<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within \neach frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 1: Adverse reactions with Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n\nInfections and infestations \nUncommon Urinary tract infection \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon Insomnia, thinking abnormal \nNervous system disorders \nCommon Headache \nUncommon Dizziness, dysgeusia, somnolence \nEye disorders \nCommon Dry eye \nUncommon Visual disturbance, including vision blurred \nVascular disorders \nUncommon Hypertension \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon Nasal dryness \nUncommon Dyspnoea, cough, rhinitis \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common Constipation, dry mouth \nCommon Abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia \nUncommon Flatulence, diarrhoea, mouth ulceration \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nUncommon Rash, dry skin, pruritus, hyperhidrosis \nNot known Angioedema \nRenal and urinary disorders \nUncommon Urinary retention, urinary tract disorder, bladder pain \nReproductive system and breast disorders \nUncommon Erectile dysfunction, vaginitis \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nUncommon Oedema peripheral, asthenia, face oedema, oedema \nInvestigations \nUncommon Aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine \n\naminotransferase increased \nInjury, poisoning, and procedural complications \nUncommon Injury \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \nIn the pivotal clinical trials with doses of Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg, adverse reactions were reported \nas presented in the table above. Most of the adverse reactions were of mild or moderate intensity and \ndid not result in discontinuation in the majority of the patients. \n \nTreatment with Emselex may possibly mask symptoms associated with gallbladder disease. However, \nthere was no association between the occurrence of adverse events related to the biliary system in \ndarifenacin-treated patients and increasing age. \n \nThe incidence of adverse reactions with the doses of Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg decreased during the \ntreatment period up to 6 months. A similar trend is also seen for the discontinuation rates. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nPost-marketing experience \nThe following events have been reported in association with darifenacin use in worldwide post-\nmarketing experience: generalised hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, depressed \nmood/mood alterations, hallucination. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the \nworldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events cannot be estimated from the available \ndata. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEmselex has been administered in clinical trials at doses up to 75 mg (five times maximum therapeutic \ndose). The most common adverse reactions seen were dry mouth, constipation, headache, dyspepsia \nand nasal dryness. However, overdose with darifenacin can potentially lead to severe anticholinergic \neffects and should be treated accordingly. Therapy should be aimed at reversing the anticholinergic \nsymptoms under careful medical supervision. The use of agents such as physostigmine can assist in \nreversing such symptoms. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, drugs for urinary frequency and incontinence; ATC code: \nG04BD10. \n \nMechanism of action  \nDarifenacin is a selective muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist (M3 SRA) in vitro. The M3 receptor is \nthe major subtype that controls urinary bladder muscle contraction. It is not known whether this \nselectivity for the M3 receptor translates into any clinical advantage when treating symptoms of \noveractive bladder syndrome. \n \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \nCystometric studies performed with darifenacin in patients with involuntary bladder contractions \nshowed increased bladder capacity, increased volume threshold for unstable contractions and \ndiminished frequency of unstable detrusor contractions. \n \nTreatment with Emselex administered at dosages of 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily has been investigated in \nfour double-blind, Phase III, randomised, controlled clinical studies in male and female patients with \nsymptoms of overactive bladder. As seen in Table 2 below, a pooled analysis of 3 of the studies for the \ntreatment with both Emselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg provided a statistically significant improvement in the \nprimary endpoint, reduction in incontinence episodes, versus placebo. \n \nTable 2: Pooled analysis of data from three Phase III clinical studies assessing fixed doses of 7.5 mg \nand 15 mg Emselex \n \n\nDose N Incontinence episodes per week 95% CI P value2 \nBaseline \n(median) \n\nWeek 12 \n(median) \n\nChange from \nbaseline \n(median) \n\nDifferences \nfrom placebo1 \n\n(median) \n\n\n\n18 \n\nEmselex \n7.5 mg \nonce daily \n\n335 16.0 4.9 -8.8 (-68%) -2.0 (-3.6, -0.7) 0.004 \n\nPlacebo 271 16.6 7.9 -7.0 (-54%) -- -- -- \n        \nEmselex \n15 mg \nonce daily \n\n330 16.9 4.1 -10.6 (-77%) -3.2 (-4.5, -2.0) <0.001 \n\nPlacebo 384 16.6 6.4 -7.5 (-58%) -- -- -- \n1 Hodges Lehmann estimate: median difference from placebo in change from baseline \n2 Stratified Wilcoxon test for difference from placebo. \n \nEmselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg doses significantly reduced both the severity and number of urinary \nurgency episodes and the number of micturitions, while significantly increasing the mean volume \nvoided from baseline. \n \nEmselex 7.5 mg and 15 mg were associated with statistically significant improvements over placebo in \nsome aspects of quality of life as measured by the Kings Health Questionnaire including incontinence \nimpact, role limitations, social limitations and severity measures. \n \nFor both doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg, the percentage median reduction from baseline in the number of \nincontinence episodes per week was similar between males and females. The observed differences \nfrom placebo for males in terms of percentage and absolute reductions in incontinence episodes was \nlower than for females. \n \nThe effect of treatment with 15 mg and 75 mg of darifenacin on QT/QTc interval was evaluated in a \nstudy in 179 healthy adults (44% male: 56% females) aged 18 to 65 for 6 days (to steady state). \nTherapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of darifenacin resulted in no increase in QT/QTc interval \nprolongation from baseline compared to placebo at maximum darifenacin exposure. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDarifenacin is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Due to genetic differences, about 7% of the \nCaucasians lack the CYP2D6 enzyme and are said to be poor metabolisers. A few percent of the \npopulation have increased CYP2D6 enzyme levels (ultrafast metabolisers). The information below \napplies to subjects who have normal CYP2D6 activity (extensive metabolisers) unless otherwise \nstated. \n \nAbsorption \nDue to extensive first-pass metabolism darifenacin has a bioavailability of approximately 15% and \n19% after 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily doses at steady state. Maximum plasma levels are reached \napproximately 7 hours after administration of the prolonged-release tablets and steady-state plasma \nlevels are achieved by the sixth day of administration. At steady state, peak-to-trough fluctuations in \ndarifenacin concentrations are small (PTF: 0.87 for 7.5 mg and 0.76 for 15 mg), thereby maintaining \ntherapeutic plasma levels over the dosing interval. Food had no effect on darifenacin pharmacokinetics \nduring multiple-dose administration of prolonged-release tablets. \n \nDistribution \nDarifenacin is a lipophilic base and is 98% bound to plasma proteins (primarily to alpha-1-acid-\nglycoprotein). The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is estimated to be 163 litres. \n \nMetabolism \nDarifenacin is extensively metabolised by the liver following oral administration. \n \nDarifenacin undergoes significant metabolism by cytochrome CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in the liver and \nby CYP3A4 in the gut wall. The three main metabolic routes are as follows: \nmonohydroxylation in the dihydrobenzofuran ring; \n\n\n\n19 \n\ndihydrobenzofuran ring opening and \nN-dealkylation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen. \n \nThe initial products of the hydroxylation and N-dealkylation pathways are major circulating \nmetabolites but none contribute significantly to the overall clinical effect of darifenacin. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darifenacin at steady state are dose-dependent, due to saturation of the \nCYP2D6 enzyme. \n \nDoubling the darifenacin dose from 7.5 mg to 15 mg result in a 150% increase in steady-state \nexposure. This dose-dependency is probably caused by saturation of the CYP2D6 catalysed \nmetabolism possibly together with some saturation of CYP3A4-mediated gut wall metabolism. \n \nExcretion \nFollowing administration of an oral dose of 14C-darifenacin solution to healthy volunteers, \napproximately 60% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 40% in the faeces. Only a small \npercentage of the excreted dose was unchanged darifenacin (3%). Estimated darifenacin clearance is \n40 litres/hour. The elimination half-life of darifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately \n13-19 hours. \n \nSpecial patient population \nGender \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of patient data indicated that darifenacin exposure was 23% \nlower in males than females (see section 5.1). \n \nElderly patients \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis of patient data indicated a trend for clearance to decrease with \nage (19% per decade based on Phase III population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients aged 60\u2013\n89 years), see section 4.2. \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe pharmacokinetics of darifenacin have not been established in the paediatric population. \n \nCYP2D6 poor metabolisers \nThe metabolism of darifenacin in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers is principally mediated by CYP3A4. In \none pharmacokinetic study the steady-state exposure in poor metabolisers was 164% and 99% higher \nduring treatment with 7.5 mg and 15 mg once daily, respectively. However, a population \npharmacokinetic analyses of Phase III data indicated that on average steady-state exposure is 66% \nhigher in poor metabolisers than in extensive metabolisers. There was considerable overlap between \nthe ranges of exposures seen in these two populations (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal insufficiency \nA small study of subjects (n=24) with varying degrees of renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nbetween 10 ml/min and 136 ml/min) given darifenacin 15 mg once daily to steady state demonstrated \nno relationship between renal function and darifenacin clearance (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic insufficiency \nDarifenacin pharmacokinetics were investigated in subjects with mild (Child Pugh A) or moderate \n(Child Pugh B) impairment of hepatic function given darifenacin 15 mg once daily to steady state. \nMild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of darifenacin. However, protein \nbinding of darifenacin was affected by moderate hepatic impairment. Unbound darifenacin exposure \nwas estimated to be 4.7-fold higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than subjects with \nnormal hepatic function (see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. There were no effects \non fertility in male and female rats treated at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (78 times the AUC0-24h of \nfree plasma concentration at maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). There were no effects \non reproductive organs in either sex in dogs treated for 1 year at oral doses up to 6 mg/kg/day \n(82 times the AUC0-24h of free plasma concentration at MRHD). Darifenacin was not teratogenic in \nrats and rabbits at doses up to 50 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. At the dose of 50 mg/kg/day in rats \n(59 times the AUC0-24h of free plasma concentration at MRHD), delay in the ossification of the sacral \nand caudal vertebrae was observed. At the dose of 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits (28 times the AUC0-24h of \nfree plasma concentration at MRHD), maternal toxicity and foetotoxicity (increased post implantation \nloss and decreased number of viable foetuses per litter) were observed. In peri and post-natal studies in \nrats, dystocia, increased foetal deaths in utero and toxicity to post-natal development (pup body weight \nand development land marks) were observed at systemic exposure levels up to 11 times the AUC0-24h \nof free plasma concentration at MRHD. \n \n \n6.

How to take Emselex \n \nAlways take Emselex exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. If you have the impression that the effect of Emselex is too strong or \ntoo weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n \nHow much Emselex to take \nThe recommended starting dose, including for patients aged over 65 years, is 7.5 mg daily.

Swallow the tablet whole. Do not chew, split or crush it. \n \nHow long to take Emselex \nYour doctor will tell you how long your treatment with Emselex will last. Do not stop treatment early \nbecause you do not see an immediate effect. Your bladder will need some time to adapt. Finish the \ncourse of treatment prescribed by your doctor. If you have not noticed any effect by then, discuss it \nwith your doctor. \n \nIf you take more Emselex than you should \nIf you have taken more tablets than you have been told to take, or if someone else accidentally takes \nyour tablets, go to your doctor or hospital for advice immediately. When seeking medical advice, \nmake sure that you take this leaflet and your remaining tablets with you to show them to the doctor. \nPeople who have taken an overdose may have dry mouth, constipation, headache, indigestion and \nnasal dryness. Overdose with Emselex may lead to severe symptoms requiring emergency treatment in \nhospital. \n \nIf you forget to take Emselex \nIf you forget to take Emselex at the usual time, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is the time \nfor your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Emselex \nIt has been shown that taking all doses at the appropriate times can greatly increase the effectiveness \nof your medicine. Therefore, it is important to keep taking Emselex correctly, as described above. Do \nnot stop taking Emselex until your doctor tells you to. You should not experience any effects when \nyou stop treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.
