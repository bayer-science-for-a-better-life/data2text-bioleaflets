This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nRitemvia 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg of rituximab. \n \nEach mL of concentrate contains 10 mg of rituximab. \n \nRituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody representing a \nglycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions and murine light-chain and \nheavy-chain variable region sequences. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster \novary) cell suspension culture and purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange, including \nspecific viral inactivation and removal procedures. \n \nExcipients with known effects: \nThis medicinal product contains 52.6 mg sodium per 10 mL vial, equivalent to 2.6% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.For the full list of excipients, see \nsection 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion.  \nClear, colourless liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRitemvia is indicated in adults for the following indications:  \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) \n \nRitemvia is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nRitemvia maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients \nresponding to induction therapy. \n \nRitemvia monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma \nwho are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. \n \nRitemvia is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \n\n\n\n3  \n\nRitemvia, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \nsevere, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis \n(MPA). \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n\n \nRitemvia is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRitemvia should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPremedication and prophylactic medications \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Ritemvia. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, premedication with glucocorticoids should be considered \nif Ritemvia is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) or microscopic polyangiitis in disease \nremission or pemphigus vulgaris, premedication with 100 mg intravenous methylprednisolone should \nbe completed 30 minutes prior to Ritemvia infusions to decrease the incidence and severity of \ninfusion related reactions (IRRs). \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) or microscopic polyangiitis, \nmethylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1000 mg per day is \nrecommended prior to the first infusion of Ritemvia (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be \ngiven on the same day as the first infusion of Ritemvia). This should be followed by oral prednisone \n1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) \nduring and after the 4 week induction course of Ritemvia treatment. \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with GPA/MPA or \nPV during and following rituximab treatment, as appropriate according to local clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nPosology \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \n \nRitemvia should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n\n \nMaintenance therapy \n\n• Previously untreated follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia used as a maintenance treatment for patients with previously \nuntreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until \n\n\n\n4  \n\ndisease progression or for a maximum period of two years (12 infusions in total). \n \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia used as a maintenance treatment for patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 \nbody surface area once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction therapy) \nuntil disease progression or for a maximum period of two years (8 infusions in total). \n\n \nMonotherapy \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \nweekly for four weeks. \n \nFor retreatment with Ritemvia monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \nwith Ritemvia monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks \n(see section 5.1). \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nRitemvia should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of Ritemvia \nhave not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of Ritemvia are recommended. When Ritemvia is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nPatients treated with Ritemvia must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nInduction of remission \nThe recommended dosage of Ritemvia for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis \nwith polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as \nan intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total).  \n \nMaintenance treatment \nFollowing induction of remission with Ritemvia, maintenance treatment should be initiated no \nsooner than 16 weeks after the last Ritemvia infusion. \n \nFollowing induction of remission with other standard of care immunosuppressants, Ritemvia \nmaintenance treatment should be initiated during the 4 week period that follows disease \nremission.  \n \nRitemvia should be administered as two 500 mg IV infusions separated by two weeks, followed \nby a 500 mg IV infusion every 6 months thereafter. Patients should receive Ritemvia for at least \n24 months after achievement of remission (absence of clinical signs and symptoms). For patients \nwho may be at higher risk for relapse, physicians should consider a longer duration of Ritemvia \nmaintenance therapy, up to 5 years. \n \n\n\n\n5  \n\nPemphigus vulgaris \n \nPatients treated with Ritemvia must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Ritemvia for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris is 1000 mg \nadministered as an IV infusion followed two weeks later by a second 1000 mg IV infusion in \ncombination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. \n \nMaintenance treatment \nA maintenance infusion of 500 mg IV should be administered at months 12 and 18, and then every 6 \nmonths thereafter if needed, based on clinical evaluation. \n \nTreatment of relapse \nIn the event of relapse, patients may receive 1000 mg IV. The healthcare provider should also consider \nresuming or increasing the patient’s glucocorticoid dose based on clinical evaluation.  \n \nSubsequent infusions may be administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged > 65 years). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ritemvia in children below 18 years has not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe prepared Ritemvia solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through \na dedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory \ntests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be \nrestarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest \nX-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the \nprevious rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the \ntreatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n \nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a \nreduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of \nsymptoms. \n \nFirst infusion \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated \nin 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nSubsequent infusions \n \nAll indications \n \nSubsequent doses of Ritemvia can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by \n100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n\n\n\n6  \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \npolyangiitis and pemphigus vulgaris \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nExcipients: This medicinal product contains 2.3 mmol (or 52.6 mg) sodium per 10 mL vial. To be \ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \nAll patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, \nmicroscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris must be given the patient alert card with each \ninfusion. The alert card contains important safety information for patients regarding potential \nincreased risk of infections, including PML. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be \nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \nConsultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML, the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \n\n\n\n7  \n\nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML \nand suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable \nfrom acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below. \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use \nof the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and \nin some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to \nfever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or \noedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours \nof initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with \npulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with \nincreased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion \ninterrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. \nSince initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients \nshould be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been \nresolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms \nhas rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥ 25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant \ncells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release \nsyndrome, should be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored \nthroughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for \nthe first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any \nsubsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still > 25 x 109/L. \n \nInfusion-related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \nrituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n10% of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of \nrituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic and occasionally oxygen, \nintravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine release \nsyndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment \nof hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, \nshould be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of \nrituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of \nthe cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been \nreported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n\n\n\n8  \n\nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \nAlthough rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L \nas clinical experience in this population is limited. Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who \nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable \nreduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nrituximab therapy. \n \nInfections \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). \nRituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \n \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history \nof recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose \npatients to serious infection (see section 4.8). \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including \nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \nrituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At \nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not \nbe treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) \nshould consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed \nfollowing local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \npost-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant. \n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been \nstudied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, with non-live vaccines \nresponse rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL \nwho received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate \nof response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet \nHaemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). \nFor CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but \nthat has not been investigated in clinical trials. \n \n\n\n\n9  \n\nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and pemphigus \nvulgaris \n \nMethotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk \nrelationship has not been established. \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators.  \n \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the \npost-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials \nwere mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like \nheadache, pruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, \nthe proportion of patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion \nthan following the second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with \nsubsequent courses (see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction \nin rate, or interruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, \nand, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. \nClosely monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be \nresumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have \ncompletely resolved. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \nreaction during administration of rituximab. \n \nThere are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of \npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular \ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab \nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab \ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours \nprior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nIRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and pemphigus \nvulgaris were consistent with those seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with \na history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion-related reactions, above). \n \n\n\n\n10  \n\nInfections \nBased on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important \nrole in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \nrituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \nwith rituximab (see section 4.8). Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, \nsevere infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \nexercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. \n \nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly \nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, \npatients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nHepatitis B Infections \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving \nrituximab. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \nwith rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \ndisease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either \nHBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n\n \nLate neutropenia \nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months \nafter cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and \nStevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In \ncase of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nImmunisation \nPhysicians should review the patient’s vaccination status and follow current immunisation \nguidelines prior to rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to \nfirst administration of rituximab. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. \nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst \nperipherally B cell depleted. \n \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to non-live \nvaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \nrituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), \nreduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal \nantibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after rituximab as \ncompared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst \n\n\n\n11  \n\nreceiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next \ncourse of rituximab. \n \nIn the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, \nrubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. \n \nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \nThe concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n \nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). The \navailable data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such \ntherapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely \nobserved for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab \ntherapy. \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of \nlimited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data \ndo not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the \ndevelopment of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with rituximab. \n \nIn CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n \nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab \nin rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n\n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic \nmonoclonal antibodies. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \nDMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \nrituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment \nwith the biologic DMARD. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following \ntreatment with rituximab. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \n\n\n\n12  \n\nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women \nshould not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nExperience from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were \nIRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of \ninfusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after \neight doses of rituximab. \n\n \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of \npatients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials \nin patients with CLL \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were: \n IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n Infections, see section 4.4. \n Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy \nare summarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ \n1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< \n1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could \n\n\n\n13  \n\nnot be estimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \nTable 1  ADRs reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing surveillance in  \n\npatients with NHL and CLL disease treated with rituximab \nmonotherapy/maintenance or in combination with chemotherapy \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections \nand \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfections, \nviral \ninfections, \n+bronchitis \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory \ntract infection, \nfungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, \n+acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1 \n\n serious viral \ninfection2 \npneumocystis \njirovecii \n\nPML  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocyto\npenia \n\nanaemia, \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytope\nnia \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenop\nathy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate \nneutropenia3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion-relate\nd reactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivity  anaphylaxis tumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum \nsickness \n\ninfusion-relate\nd acute \nreversible \nthrombocytop\nenia4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemia\n, weight \ndecrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, \nincreased LDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, \nanxiety \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \npalsy5 \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \nsenses5 \n\nEye disorders  lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear \npain \n\n   hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, \n+atrial \nfibrillation, \ntachycardia, \n+cardiac \n\n+left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventri-\ncular \ntachycardia, \n+ventricular \n\nsevere cardiac \ndisorders4 and 6 \n\nheart failure4 \nand 6 \n\n \n\n\n\n14  \n\ndisorder tachycardia, \n+angina, \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominatel\ny cutaneous), \nleukocytoclast\nic vasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n bronchospasm4, \nrespiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased \ncough,  \nrhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung \ndisorder, \nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung disease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4 \n\nlung \ninfiltration \n\nGastrointesti\nnal disorders \n\nnausea vomiting , \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal pain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intestin\nal perforation7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneou\ns tissue \ndisorders \n\npruritus, \nrash, \n+alopecia \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe bullous \nskin reactions, \nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome, \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nsyndrome)7 \n\n \n\nMusculoskele\ntal, \nconnective \ntissue and \nbone \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck pain, \npain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nn site \nconditions \n\nfever, chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, \nmalaise, \ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering, \n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\ninfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\nInvestigation\ns \n\ndecreased \nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked \nwith \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of rituximab \ntherapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated \nwith infusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n\n \n\n\n\n15  \n\nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, \nwere reported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control \narms: haematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, \npyrexia. \n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% \nof patients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the \nfirst one to two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other \nsymptoms included flushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, \nfatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, \ndyspnoea, dyspepsia, asthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related \nreactions (such as bronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional \nreactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions \nsuch as angina pectoris or congestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, \nmyocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis \nsyndrome, cytokine release syndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower \nor unknown frequencies. The incidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially \nwith subsequent infusions and is < 1% of patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing \ntreatment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nRituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with \ndecreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients. \n \nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in \nthe rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about \n4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, \nincluding grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up \nto 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of \ninfections reported over a 2-year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections \neither new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with \nrituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious \nviral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster \nVirus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n(PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and \nretreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, have \nbeen reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 \nhepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs. 0% FC. \nProgression of Kaposi’s sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with pre-\nexisting Kaposi’s sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the majority \nof patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) \nneutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. \nDuring rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1%, grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \nneutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in \n\n\n\n16  \n\npreviously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were \nusually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the \nhigher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not \nassociated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with \nchemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established \nthat in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil \ncount remaining below 1x109/L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late \nonset (defined as neutrophil count below 1x109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with \nno previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with \nrituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of \nlate neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. \nIn the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm \ncompared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade 3/4 \nthrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in \nthe FC group. \n \nIn studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least \nbaseline level within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with rituximab and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with rituximab compared to < 1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n\n \nRespiratory system \nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2%) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low \nboth in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% \nFC). \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \n\n\n\n17  \n\nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nrituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was \nadministered with chemotherapy. \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n2 years). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been \nobserved in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years): \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3/4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared \nto younger patients (< 65 years). \n \nBulky disease \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6% vs. 15.4%). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \ntwo groups. \n \nRe-treatment \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n\n \nPatient subpopulations - rituximab combination therapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (< 65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory \nCLL. \n \nExperience from rheumatoid arthritis \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3,100 patients received at least one \ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; \n\n\n\n18  \n\napproximately 2,400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1,000 having \nreceived 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience \nreflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients received 2 x 1,000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \nmethotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 2. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall \nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during \nthe initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like \nreaction have been reported during post marketing experience. \n \nTable 2 Summary of adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials or during \n\npost-marketing surveillance occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nreceiving rituximab \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nupper respiratory \ntract infection, \nurinary tract \ninfections \n\nbronchitis, sinusitis, \ngastroenteritis, tinea \npedís \n\n  PML, \nreactivation of \nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n neutropenia1  late \nneutropenia2 \n\nserum \nsickness-like \nreaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n3infusion-related \nreactions \n(hypertension, \nnausea, rash, \npyrexia, pruritus, \nurticaria, throat \nirritation, hot \nflush, \nhypotension, \nrhinitis, rigors, \ntachycardia, \nfatigue, \noropharyngeal \npain, peripheral \noedema, erythma) \n\n 3infusion-related \nreactions \n(generalised \noedema, \nbronchospasm, \nwheezing, \nlaryngeal \noedema, \nangioneurotic \noedema, \ngeneralised \npruritis, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactoid \nreaction) \n\n  \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nMetabolism and \nnutritional \ndisorders \n\n hypercholesterolemia    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n depression, anxiety    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache paraesthesia, \nmigraine, dizziness, \nsciatica \n\n   \n\nCardiac disorders    angina \npectoris, atrial \nfibrillation, \nheart failure, \nmyocardial \ninfarction \n\natrial flutter \n\nGastrointestinal  dyspepsia, diarrhoea,    \n\n\n\n19  \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\ndisorders gastro-oesophageal \nreflux, mouth \nulceration, upper \nabdominal pain \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n alopecia   toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nsyndrome), \nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome5 \n\nMusculo-skeletal \ndisorders \n\n arthralgia / \nmusculoskeletal \npain, osteoarthritis, \nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased IgM \nlevels4 \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring in clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

IRRs may occur as \na result of hypersensitivity and/or to the mechanism of action. \n4 Includes observations collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring. \n5 Includes fatal cases \n\n \nMultiple courses \nMultiple courses of treatment are associated with a similar ADR profile to that observed following \nfirst exposure. The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first \n6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the \nfirst treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first \n6 months of treatment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs (refer to Table \n2). Among the 3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1,135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with \n733/3,189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \nrituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than \n1% (17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no \ndeaths due to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading \nto withdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with \nintravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n \nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious \nIRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour \nintravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic \ntherapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent \nwith that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. \n \nInfections \nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated \npatients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper \nrespiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious \nor required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections \ndid not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory \ntract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence \nin the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. \n\n\n\n20  \n\n \nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid \narthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and \nvasculitis. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). \nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients \nreceiving rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated \npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \nNeutropenia \nEvents of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were \ntransient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the \nadministration of rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and \n0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia. \n \nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \npatients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nExperience from granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nInduction of remission \n99 patients were treated for induction of remission of GPA and MPA in a clinical trial with rituximab \n(375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \n\n\n\n21  \n\nThe ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the \nrituximab group and at a higher frequency than the comparator group. \n \nTable 3 Adverse drug reactions occurring at 6-months in ≥ 5% of patients receiving \n\nrituximab for induction of remission of GPA and MPA, and at a higher \nfrequency than the comparator group, in the pivotal clinical study. \n\nBody system \nAdverse event \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nInfections and infestations \nUrinary tract infection 7% \nBronchitis 5% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic  \nsystem disorders \n\nThrombocytopenia 7% \nImmune system disorders \n\nCytokine release syndrome 5% \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHyperkalaemia 5% \nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia 14% \nNervous system disorders \n\nDizziness 10% \nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \nHypertension 12% \nFlushing 5% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and  \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough 12% \nDyspnoea 11% \nEpistaxis 11% \nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal  \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea 18% \nDyspepsia 6% \nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \ntissue disorders \n\nAcne 7% \nMusculoskeletal and connective  \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms 18% \nArthralgia 15% \nBack pain 10% \nMuscle weakness 5% \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nPain in extremities 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site conditions \n\n\n\n22  \n\nBody system \nAdverse event \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n \nMaintenance treatment \nIn a further clinical study, a total of 57 severe, active GPA and MPA patients in disease remission \nwere treated with rituximab for the maintenance of remission (see section 5.1). \n \nTable 4 Adverse drug reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of patients receiving rituximab for \n\nmaintenance treatment of GPA and MPA, and at a higher frequency than the \ncomparator group \n\nSystem Organ Class \nAdverse drug reaction1 \n\nRituximab  \n(n=57) \n\nInfections and infestations   \nBronchitis 14% \nRhinitis 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\n \n\nPyrexia 9% \nInfluenza-like illness 5% \nOedema peripheral 5% \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   \nDiarrhoea 7% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders  \n\nDyspnoea 9% \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications \n\n \n\nInfusion-related reactions2 12% \n1 Events were considered ADRs only after thorough assessment and where a causal relationship between the \nmedicinal product and the adverse event was at least a reasonable possibility. \n2Details on infusion related reactions are provided in the description of selected adverse drug reactions \nsection. \n\n \nThe overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile for rituximab in \napproved autoimmune indications, including GPA/MPA. Overall, 4% of patients in the rituximab arm \nexperienced adverse events leading to discontinuation. Most adverse events in the rituximab arm were \nmild or moderate in intensity. No patients in the rituximab arm had fatal adverse events. \n \nThe most commonly reported events considered as ADRs were infusion-related reactions and \ninfections.   \n \nIn a long-term observational safety study, 97 GPA/MPA patients received treatment with rituximab \n(mean of 8 infusions [range 1-28]) for up to 4 years, according to their physician’s standard practice \nand discretion. The overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile of \nrituximab in RA and GPA/MPA and no new adverse drug reactions were reported. \n \nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nIn the clinical trial studying induction of remission with severe active GPA and MPA, IRRs were \n\n\n\n23  \n\ndefined as any adverse event occurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be \ninfusion-related by investigators in the safety population. Of the 99 patients treated with rituximab, \n12 (12%) experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs \nincluded cytokine release syndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in \ncombination with intravenous glucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these \nevents. \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, 7/57 (12%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced at \nleast one infusion-related reaction. The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest during or after the \nfirst infusion (9%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (< 4%).  \n \nInfections \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, which included 99 rituximab-treated patients, the \noverall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years (95% CI 197-285) at the 6-\nmonth primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of \nupper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. The rate of serious \ninfections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently reported serious \ninfection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%. \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, 30/57 (53%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced \ninfections. The incidence of all grade infections was similar between the arms. Infections were \npredominately mild to moderate. The most common infections in the rituximab arm included upper \nrespiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections and herpes zoster. The incidence \nof serious infections was similar in both arms (approximately 12%). The most commonly reported \nserious infection in the rituximab group was mild or moderate bronchitis. \n \nMalignancies \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, the incidence of malignancy in rituximab treated patients \nin the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis clinical study was 2.00 per 100 \npatient years at the study common closing date (when the final patient had completed the follow-up \nperiod). On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears to be \nsimilar to that previously reported in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 \nper 100 patient years (95% CI 149-470) at the 6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac \nevents was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI 3-15). The most frequently reported events were \ntachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4). \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, \nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nA small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the post-\nmarketing setting. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. The \nrate of overall infections and serious infections was not increased after the development of low IgA, \nIgG or IgM. \n\n\n\n24  \n\n \nIn the induction of remission clinical trial, at 6 months, in the rituximab group, 27%, 58% and 51% \nof patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, \nrespectively, compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group.  \n\n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, no clinically meaningful differences between the two \ntreatment arms or decreases in total immunoglobulin, IgG, IgM or IgA levels were observed \nthroughout the trial. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn the induction of remission clinical trial, 24% of patients in the rituximab group (single course) and \n23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. \nNeutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in rituximab-treated \npatients.  \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, the incidence of all-grade neutropenia was 0% for \nrituximab-treated patients vs. 5% for azathioprine treated patients. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nExperience from pemphigus vulgaris \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoids in the \ntreatment of patients with pemphigus vulgaris was studied in a Phase 3, randomised, controlled, \nmulticenter, open-label study in pemphigus patients that included 38 pemphigus vulgaris (PV) \npatients randomised to the rituximab group. Patients randomised to the rituximab group received an \ninitial 1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15. Maintenance doses \nof 500 mg IV were administered at months 12 and 18. Patients could receive 1000 mg IV at the time \nof relapse (see section 5.1).   \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with PV was consistent with that observed in RA and \nGPA/MPA patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions presented in Table 5 were adverse events which occurred at a rate of ≥ 5% \namong rituximab-treated PV patients, with a ≥ 2% absolute difference in incidence between the \nrituximab-treated group and the standard-dose prednisone group up to month 24. No patients were \nwithdrawn due to ADRs. \n \nTable 5 Adverse drugs reactions for rituximab-treated pemphigus vulgaris patients in \n\nthe clinical study up to month 24 \nSystem Organ Class \n\nAdverse drug reaction \nrituximab + low-dose prednisone \n\n(n=38) \nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural  \nComplications \n\nInfusion-related reactions* 58% \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue  \nDisorders \n\nAlopecia 13% \nPruritus 5% \n\n\n\n25  \n\nUrticaria 5% \nSkin disorder 5% \n\nPsychiatric Disorders \nPersistent depressive disorder 13% \nMajor depression 5% \nIrritability 5% \n\nInfections and Infestations \nHerpes virus infection 8% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nOral herpes 5% \nConjunctivitis 5% \n\nGeneral Disorders and Administration  \nSite Conditions \n\nFatigue 8% \nPyrexia 5% \n\nNervous System Disorders \nHeadache 5% \nDizziness 5% \n\nGastrointestinal Disorders \nAbdominal pain upper 5% \n\nCardiac Disorders \nTachycardia 5% \n\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue \nDisorders \n\nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nNeoplasms Benign, Malignant and  \nUnspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \n\nSkin papilloma 5% \n* Infusion-related reactions included symptoms collected on the next scheduled visit after each infusion, and \n\nadverse events occurring on the day of or one day after the infusion. The most common infusion-related \nreaction symptoms/Preferred Terms included headaches, chills, high blood pressure, nausea, asthenia and \npain.  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions in the pemphigus vulgaris clinical study were common (58%). Nearly all \ninfusion-related reactions were mild to moderate. The proportion of patients experiencing an \ninfusion-related reaction was 29% (11 patients), 40% (15 patients), 13% (5 patients), and 10% (4 \npatients) following the first, second, third, and fourth infusions, respectively. No patients were \nwithdrawn from treatment due to infusion-related reactions. Symptoms of infusion-related reactions \nwere similar in type and severity to those seen in RA and GPA/MPA patients. \n\n \nInfections \n14 patients (37%) in the rituximab group experienced treatment-related infections compared to 15 \npatients (42%) in the standard-dose prednisone group. The most common infections in the rituximab \ngroup were herpes simplex and zoster infections, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, fungal infection \nand conjunctivitis. Three patients (8%) in the rituximab group experienced a total of 5 serious \n\n\n\n26  \n\ninfections (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, infective thrombosis, intervertebral discitis, lung \ninfection, Staphylococcal sepsis) and one patient (3%) in the standard-dose prednisone group \nexperienced a serious infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation \nis available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in \nhumans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No \nadditional safety signals were identified. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had \nno reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with \na dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC02.  \n \nRitemvia is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on > 95% of \nall B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize \nupon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the \nplasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on \nthe surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. \nIn patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of \ntreatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, \nalthough in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months \npost-induction therapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the \nperipheral blood was observed following two infusions of 1000 mg rituximab separated by a 14 day \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n27  \n\ninterval. Peripheral blood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation \nis observed in the majority of patients by week 40, whether rituximab was administered as \nmonotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had prolonged \nperipheral B cell depletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of rituximab. In patients with \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells \ndecreased to < 10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that \nlevel in most patients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B \ncell return, with counts > 10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. \n \nClinical experience in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nMonotherapy \nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \nreceived 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48% (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% \ncomplete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% \nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. \nNeither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence nor absence of bulky disease, normal \nor high LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher’s exact \ntest) on response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response \nrates and bone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded \ncompared to 59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not \nsupported by a stepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as \nprognostic factors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and \nbulky disease. \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% – 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n \nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses \nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \nlesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as \nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36% (CI95% 21% – 51%; CR 3%, PR \n33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n \nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were \nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \npatients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course \nin the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the \nORR was 38% (CI95% 26% – 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for responding \npatients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 – 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after \nthe prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). \n \nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \n\n\n\n28  \n\nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on \ndays 1-5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP). \nRituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 \nR-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow up of \npatients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, \ntime to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of \npatients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p< 0.0001 Chi-Square \ntest) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP \nsignificantly prolonged the time to disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months \nand 14.7 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was \n37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < 0.0001, log-rank \ntest). \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were \n80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1% for patients in the CVP group．  \n \nResults from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy \nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-α) have also demonstrated significant \nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

A total of 1078 patients \nresponded to induction therapy, of which 1018 were randomised to rituximab maintenance therapy \n(n=505) or observation (n=513). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regards to \nbaseline characteristics and disease status. Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single \ninfusion of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 2 months until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years. \n \nThe pre-specified primary analysis was conducted at a median observation time of 25 months \nfrom randomisation, maintenance therapy with rituximab resulted in a clinically relevant and \nstatistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of investigator assessed progression-\nfree survival (PFS) as compared to observation in patients with previously untreated follicular \nlymphoma (Table 7). \n \nSignificant benefit from maintenance treatment with rituximab was also seen for the secondary \nendpoints event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNLT) time to next \nchemotherapy (TNCT) and overall response rate (ORR) in the primary analysis (Table 7).  \n \nData from extended follow-up of patients in the study (median follow-up 9 years) confirmed the \nlong-term benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy in terms of PFS, EFS, TNLT and TNCT (Table \n7). \n \nTable 7 Overview of efficacy results for rituximab maintenance vs. observation at the \n\nprotocol-defined primary analysis and after 9 years median follow-up (final \nanalysis) \n\n Primary analysis \n(median FU: 25 months) \n\nFinal analysis \n(median FU: 9.0 years) \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nRituximab \nN=505 \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nRituximab \nN=505 \n\nPrimary efficacy     \nProgression-free survival (median) NR NR 4.06 years 10.49 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.50 (0.39, 0.64) \n50% \n\n0.61 (0.52, 0.73) \n39% \n\nSecondary efficacy     \nOverall survival (median) NR NR NR NR \nlog-rank p value 0.7246 0.7948 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.89 (0.45, 1.74) \n11% \n\n1.04 (0.77, 1.40) \n-6% \n\nEvent-free survival (median) 38 months NR 4.04 years 9.25 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.54 (0.43, 0.69) \n46% \n\n0.64 (0.54, 0.76) \n36% \n\nTNLT (median) NR NR 6.11 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0003 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.61 (0.46, 0.80) \n39% \n\n0.66 (0.55, 0.78) \n34% \n\nTNCT (median) NR NR 9.32 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0011 0.0004 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.60 (0.44, 0.82) \n40% \n\n0.71 (0.59, 0.86) \n39% \n\nOverall response rate* 55% 74% 61% 79% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.33 (1.73, 3.15) 2.43 (1.84, 3.22) \nComplete response (CR/CRu) rate* 48% 67% 53% 67% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.21 (1.65, 2.94) 2.34 (1.80, 3.03)  \n* at end of maintenance/observation; final analysis results based on median follow-up of 73 months.

Exploratory analyses of the benefit of maintenance treatment showed a less pronounced \neffect in elderly patients (> 70 years of age), however sample sizes were small. \n \nRelapsed/Refractory follicular lymphoma \n \nIn a prospective, open label, international, multicentre, phase III trial, 465 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma were randomised in a first step to induction therapy with \neither CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone; n=231) or rituximab \nplus CHOP (R-CHOP, n=234). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regard to \nbaseline characteristics and disease status. A total of 334 patients achieving a complete or partial \nremission following induction therapy were randomised in a second step to rituximab maintenance \ntherapy (n=167) or observation (n=167). Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single \ninfusion of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 3 months until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all patients randomised to both parts of the study. After a \nmedian observation time of 31 months for patients randomised to the induction phase, R-CHOP \nsignificantly improved the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma when \ncompared to CHOP (see Table 8). \n \nTable 8 Induction phase: overview of efficacy results for CHOP vs. R-CHOP (31 \n\nmonths median observation time) \n \n\nCHOP R‐CHOP p‐value \nRisk \n\nReduction1) \nPrimary efficacy     \n\nORR2) 74% 87% 0.0003 NA \nCR2) 16% 29% 0.0005 NA \nPR2) 58% 58% 0.9449 NA \n\n1) Estimates were calculated by hazard ratios \n2) Last tumour response as assessed by the investigator.

Maintenance treatment with rituximab led to a clinically \nrelevant and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, PFS, (time from \nmaintenance randomisation to relapse, disease progression or death) when compared to observation \nalone (p< 0.0001 log-rank test). The median PFS was 42.2 months in the rituximab maintenance \narm compared to 14.3 months in the observation arm. Using a cox regression analysis, the risk of \nexperiencing progressive disease or death was reduced by 61% with rituximab maintenance \ntreatment when compared to observation (95% CI; 45%-72%). Kaplan-Meier estimated \nprogression-free rates at 12 months were 78% in the rituximab maintenance group vs. 57% in the \nobservation group. An analysis of overall survival confirmed the significant benefit of rituximab \nmaintenance over observation (p=0.0039 log-rank test). Rituximab maintenance treatment reduced \nthe risk of death by 56% (95% CI; 22%-75%). \n\n \nTable 9 Maintenance phase: overview of efficacy results rituximab vs. observation (28 \n\nmonths median observation time) \n\n\n\n31  \n\nEfficacy Parameter \n\nKaplan-Meier Estimate of \nMedian Time to Event (months) Risk \n\nReduction Observation \n(N = 167) \n\nRituximab \n(N=167) \n\nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression‐free survival \n(PFS) 14.3 42.2 < 0.0001 61% \n\nOverall survival NR NR 0.0039 56% \n\nTime to new lymphoma \ntreatment 20.1 38.8 < 0.0001 50% \n\n     \nDisease‐free survivala 16.5 53.7 0.0003 67% \n\nSubgroup analysis     \nPFS     \n\nCHOP 11.6 37.5 < 0.0001 71% \nR-CHOP 22.1 51.9 0.0071 46% \n\nCR 14.3 52.8 0.0008 64% \nPR 14.3 37.8 < 0.0001 54% \n\nOS     \nCHOP NR NR 0.0348 55% \n\nR-CHOP NR NR 0.0482 56% \nNR: not reached; a: only applicable to patients achieving a CR \n \nThe benefit of rituximab maintenance treatment was confirmed in all subgroups analysed, regardless \nof induction regimen (CHOP or R-CHOP) or quality of response to induction treatment (CR or PR) \n(Table 9). Rituximab maintenance treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients \nresponding to CHOP induction therapy (median PFS 37.5 months vs. 11.6 months, p< 0.0001) as \nwell as in those responding to R-CHOP induction (median PFS 51.9 months vs. 22.1 months, \np=0.0071). Although subgroups were small, rituximab maintenance treatment provided a significant \nbenefit in terms of overall survival for both patients responding to CHOP and patients responding to \nR-CHOP, although longer follow-up is required to confirm this observation. \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nIn a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 \nyears) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy \n(cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 \nmg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or \nrituximab 375 mg/m2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of the \ntreatment cycle. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well \nbalanced in baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-\nCHOP treatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in \nthe duration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse \nor progression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p=0.0001). Kaplan \nMeier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm \ncompared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41%. At 24 months, \nestimates for overall survival were 68.2% in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4% in the CHOP arm. \nA subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up \nduration of 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), \nrepresenting a risk reduction of 32%. \n \nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The \n\n\n\n32  \n\ncomplete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2% in the R-CHOP group and 62.4% in the CHOP group \n(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46% and the risk of relapse by 51%. In all \npatients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 microglobulin, LDH, \nalbumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for \nevent-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and \n0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and low-risk \npatients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings \nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n356 patients evaluated for anti-drug antibody (ADA), 1.1% (4 patients) were positive. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients \nwith relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 \nmg/m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in \ncombination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first \ncycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent \ntreatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had \npreviously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to \nachieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total \nof 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 10a and Table 10b) and 552 \npatients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 11) were analysed for efficacy. \n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 \nmonths in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of \noverall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone \n(p=0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 10a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most \npatient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 10b). \n \nTable 10a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n\nOverview of efficacy results for rituximab plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \nmedian observation time \n\nEfficacy Parameter Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Median \nTime to Event (months) \n\nRisk \nReduction \n\nFC \n(N = 409) \n\nR-FC \n(N=408) \n\nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression‐free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \nOverall survival NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) \nCR rates \n\n72.6% \n16.9% \n\n85.8% \n36.0% \n\n<0.0001 \n<0.0001 \n\nN/A \nN/A \n\nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

Eligible patients had active rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosed according \nto the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Rituximab was administered as two \nIV infusions separated by an interval of 15 days. Patients received 2 x 1000 mg intravenous infusions \nof rituximab or placebo in combination with MTX. All patients received concomitant 60 mg oral \nprednisone on days 2-7 and 30 mg on days 8-14 following the first infusion. The primary endpoint \nwas the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. Patients were followed \nbeyond week 24 for long-term endpoints, including radiographic assessment at 56 weeks and at 104 \nweeks. During this time, 81% of patients, from the original placebo group received rituximab \nbetween weeks 24 and 56, under an open label extension study protocol. \n \nTrials of rituximab in patients with early arthritis (patients without prior methotrexate treatment and \npatients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, but not yet treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors) \nhave met their primary endpoints. Rituximab is not indicated for these patients, since the safety data \nabout long-term rituximab treatment are insufficient, in particular concerning the risk of \ndevelopment of malignancies and PML. \n \nDisease activity outcomes \nRituximab in combination with methotrexate significantly increased the proportion of patients \nachieving at least a 20% improvement in ACR score compared with patients treated with \nmethotrexate alone (Table 12). Across all development studies the treatment benefit was similar in \npatients independent of age, gender, body surface area, race, number of prior treatments or disease \nstatus. \n \nClinically and statistically significant improvement was also noted on all individual components of \nthe ACR response (tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessment, \ndisability index scores (HAQ), pain assessment and C-Reactive Proteins (mg/dL). \n \nTable 12 Clinical response outcomes at primary endpoint in Trial 1 (ITT population) \n Outcome† Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX \n\n(2 x 1000 mg) \nTrial 1  N= 201 N= 298 \n\n ACR20 36 (18%) 153 (51%)*** \nACR50 11 (5%) 80 (27%)*** \nACR70 3 (1%) 37 (12%)*** \n\n EULAR Response \n(Good/Moderate) 44 (22%) 193 (65%)\n\n*** \n\n Mean change in DAS ‐0.34 ‐1.83*** \n† Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo + MTX at the primary time point: ***p ≤ 0.0001 \n \nPatients treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate had a significantly greater \nreduction in disease activity score (DAS28) than patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 12). \nSimilarly, a good to moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was \nachieved by significantly more rituximab treated patients treated with rituximab and methotrexate \ncompared to patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 12). \n \nRadiographic response \nStructural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing \nscore. \n\n\n\n35  \n\nIn Trial 1, conducted in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF \ninhibitor therapies, receiving rituximab in combination with methotrexate demonstrated \nsignificantly less radiographic progression than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at \n56 weeks. Of the patients originally receiving methotrexate alone, 81% received rituximab either as \nrescue between weeks 16-24 or in the extension trial, before week 56. A higher proportion of \npatients receiving the original rituximab/MTX treatment also had no erosive progression over 56 \nweeks (Table 13). \n \nTable 13 Radiographic outcomes at 1 year (mITT population) \n Placebo+MTX Rituximab +MTX \n\n2 × 1000 mg \n\nTrial 1 (n=184) (n=273) \nMean change from baseline:   \n\nModified total sharp score 2.30 1.01* \n\nErosion score 1.32 0.60* \n\nJoint space narrowing score 0.98 0.41** \n\nProportion of patients with no \nradiographic change \n\n46% 53%, NS \n\nProportion of patients with no erosive \nchange \n\n52% 60%, NS \n\n150 patients originally randomised to placebo + MTX in Trial 1 received at least one course of RTX + MTX by \none year \n* p <0.05, ** p < 0.001.

Radiographic \nanalysis at 2 years in Trial 1 demonstrated significantly reduced progression of structural joint \ndamage in patients receiving rituximab in combination with methotrexate compared to methotrexate \nalone as well as a significantly higher proportion of patients with no progression of joint damage \nover the 2 year period. \n \nPhysical function and quality of life outcomes \nSignificant reductions in disability index (HAQ-DI) and fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scores were \nobserved in patients treated with rituximab compared to patients treated with methotrexate alone. The \nproportions of rituximab treated patients showing a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in \nHAQ-DI (defined as an individual total score decrease of >0.22) was also higher than among patients \nreceiving methotrexate alone (Table 14). \n \nSignificant improvement in health related quality of life was also demonstrated with significant \nimprovement in both the physical health score (PHS) and mental health score (MHS) of the SF-36. \nFurther, significantly higher proportion of patients achieved MCIDs for these scores (Table 14). \n \nTable 14 Physical function and quality of life outcomes at week 24 in Trial 1 \n \n\nOutcome† Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX (2 x 1000 mg) \n \n \nMean change in HAQ‐DI \n\nn=201 \n \n\n0.1 \n\nn=298 \n \n\n‐0.4*** \n\n% HAQ‐DI MCID 20% 51% \n\nMean change in FACIT‐T ‐0.5 ‐9.1*** \n\n\n\n36  \n\n \n \nMean change in SF‐36 PHS \n\nn=197 \n \n\n0.9 \n\nn=294 \n \n\n5.8*** \n\n% SF‐36 PHS MCID 13% 48%*** \n\nMean change in SF‐36 MHS 1.3 4.7** \n\n% SF‐36 MHS MCID 20% 38%* \n† Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo at the primary time point: * p < 0.05, **p < 0.001 ***p ≤ 0.0001  \nMCID HAQ-DI ≥0.22, MCID SF-36 PHS >5.42, MCID SF-36 MHS >6.33 \n \nEfficacy in autoantibody (RF and or anti-CCP) seropositive patients \nPatients seropositive to Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-\nCCP) who were treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate showed an enhanced \nresponse compared to patients negative to both. \n \nEfficacy outcomes in rituximab treated patients were analysed based on autoantibody status prior \nto commencing treatment. At Week 24, patients who were seropositive to RF and/or anti-CCP at \nbaseline had a significantly increased probability of achieving ACR20 and 50 responses compared \nto seronegative patients (p=0.0312 and p=0.0096) (Table 15). These findings were replicated at \nWeek 48, where autoantibody seropositivity also significantly increased the probability of \nachieving ACR70. At week 48 seropositive patients were 2-3 times more likely to achieve ACR \nresponses compared to seronegative patients. Seropositive patients also had a significantly greater \ndecrease in DAS28-ESR compared to seronegative patients (Figure 1). \n \nTable 15 Summary of efficacy by baseline autoantibody status \n Week 24 Week 48 \n Seropositive \n\n(n=514) \nSeronegative \n\n(n=106) \nSeropositive \n\n(n=506) \nSeronegative \n\n(n=101) \nACR20 (%) 62.3* 50.9 71. 1* 51.5 \nACR50 (%) 32.7* 19.8 44.9** 22.8 \nACR70 (%) 12.1 5.7 20.9* 6.9 \nEULAR Response (%) 74.8* 62.9 84.3* 72.3 \nMean change DAS28-ESR ‐1.97** ‐1.50 ‐2.48*** ‐1.72 \n\nSignificance levels were defined as * p<0.05, **p<0.001, ***p<0.0001. \n \n\n\n\n37  \n\nFigure 1: Change from baseline of DAS28-ESR by baseline autoantibody status \n\n \n \nLong-term efficacy with multiple course therapy \nTreatment with rituximab in combination with methotrexate over multiple courses resulted in \nsustained improvements in the clinical signs and symptoms of RA, as indicated by ACR, DAS28-\nESR and EULAR responses which was evident in all patient populations studied (Figure 2). \nSustained improvement in physical function as indicated by the HAQ-DI score and the proportion of \npatients achieving MCID for HAQ-DI were observed. \n \nFigure 2: ACR responses for 4 treatment courses (24 weeks after each course (within \n\npatient, within visit) in patients with an inadequate response to \nTNF-inhibitors (n=146) \n\n \n \nClinical laboratory findings \n \nA total of 392/3095 (12.7%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis tested positive for ADA in clinical \nstudies following therapy with rituximab.

All patients in the \ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both \narms received 1000 mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 \nmg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \nglucocorticoid therapy. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was \n20%. The trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete \nremission (CR) at 6 months (Table 16). \n \nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \ndisease (Table 17). \n \nTable 16 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months \n\n(Intent-to-treat population*) \n \n\nRituximab \n(n = 99) \n\nCyclophosphamide \n(n = 98) \n\nTreatment difference \n(Rituximab -\n\ncyclophosphamide) \n\nRate 63.6% 53.1% \n10.6% \n\n95.1%b CI \n(−3.2%, 24.3%) a \n\n– CI = confidence interval. \n– * Worst case imputation \na  Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound (−3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined  \n\nnon-inferiority margin (− 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis. \n\n \nTable 17 Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n Rituximab Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI 95%) \nAll patients \nNewly diagnosed \nRelapsing \n\nn=99 \nn=48 \nn=51 \n\nn=98 \nn=48 \nn=50 \n\n \n\nComplete remission \nAll Patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (‐3.2, 24.3) \nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% − 4.2% (− 23.6, 15.3) \nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\nWorst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n \nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \n\n\n\n39  \n\nIn the rituximab group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved \nCR at 18 months. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine for \nmaintenance of complete remission), 39% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 33% of \npatients achieved CR at 18 months. From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the \nrituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients from the induction of remission trial tested positive \nfor ADA by 18 months. None of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were ADA positive at screening. \nThere was no apparent negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy in the induction \nof the remission trial. \n \nMaintenance treatment  \n \nA total of 117 patients (88 with GPA, 24 with MPA, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis) in disease remission were randomised to receive azathioprine (59 patients) or rituximab (58 \npatients) in a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open-label study. Included patients were 21 to 75 \nyears of age and had newly diagnosed or relapsing disease in complete remission after combined \ntreatment with glucocorticoids and pulse cyclophosphamide. The majority of patients were ANCA-\npositive at diagnosis or during the course of their disease; had histologically confirmed necrotizing \nsmall-vessel vasculitis with a clinical phenotype of GPA/MPA, or renal limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis; or both. \n\nRemission-induction therapy included IV prednisone, administered as per the investigator’s discretion, \npreceded in some patients by methylprednisolone pulses, and pulse cyclophosphamide until remission \nwas attained after 4 to 6 months. At that time, and within a maximum of 1 month after the last \ncyclophosphamide pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab (two 500 mg IV \ninfusions separated by two weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15) followed by 500 mg IV every 6 months for 18 \nmonths) or azathioprine (administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, then \n1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment discontinuation after these \n22 months)). Prednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose (approximately 5 mg per \nday) for at least 18 months after randomization. Prednisone dose tapering and the decision to stop \nprednisone treatment after month 18 were left at the investigator’s discretion.  \n\nAll patients were followed until month 28 (10 or 6 months, respectively, after the last rituximab infusion \nor azathioprine dose). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was required for all patients with \nCD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 250 per cubic millimeter. \n\nThe primary outcome measure was the rate of major relapse at month 28.  \n\nResults \nAt month 28, major relapse (defined by the reappearance of clinical and/or laboratory signs of \nvasculitis activity ([BVAS] > 0) that could lead to organ failure or damage or could be life \nthreatening) occurred in 3 patients (5%) in the rituximab group and 17 patients (29%) in the \nazathioprine group (p=0.0007). Minor relapses (not life threatening and not involving major organ \ndamage) occurred in seven patients in the rituximab group (12%) and eight patients in the azathioprine \ngroup (14%).  \n\nThe cumulative incidence rate curves showed that time to first major relapse was longer in patients \nwith rituximab starting from month 2 and was maintained up to month 28 (Figure 3). \n\n\n\n40  \n\nFigure 3:  Cumulative incidence over time of first major relapse \n\n      \n\n \n \n\nNumber of Subjects with Major Relapse \nAzathioprine 0 0 3 3 5 5 8 8 9 9 9 10 13 15 17 \nRituximab 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 \nNumber of subjects at risk \nAzathioprine 59 56 52 50 47 47 44 44 42 41 40 39 36 34 0 \nRituximab 58 56 56 56 55 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 52 50 0 \n\nNote: Patients were censored at month 28 if they had no event.    \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 6/34 (18%) of rituximab treated patients from the maintenance therapy clinical trial \ndeveloped ADA.

Patients were between 19 and 79 years of age and had not received prior \ntherapies for pemphigus. In the PV population, 5 (13%) patients in the rituximab group and 3 (8%) \npatients in the standard prednisone group had moderate disease and 33 (87%) patients in the rituximab \ngroup and 33 (92%) patients in the standard-dose prednisone group had severe disease according to \ndisease severity defined by Harman’s criteria. \n \nPatients were stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate or severe) and randomised 1:1 to \nreceive either rituximab and low-dose prednisone or standard-dose prednisone. Patients randomised to \nthe rituximab group received an initial intravenous infusion of 1000 mg rituximab on Study Day 1 in \ncombination with 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 3 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 6 months if they had severe disease, and a \nsecond intravenous infusion of 1000 mg on Study Day 15. Maintenance infusions of rituximab 500 mg \nwere administered at months 12 and 18. Patients randomised to the standard-dose prednisone group \nreceived an initial 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 12 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 18 months if they had severe disease.  \nPatients in the rituximab group who relapsed could receive an additional infusion of rituximab \n1000 mg in combination with reintroduced or escalated prednisone dose.

The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, \n6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions \ncontributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 \nmg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for 4 weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts \nor tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual variability \nremained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied \nby body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) \ncontributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were \nrelatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates \nis not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n \nRituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for 4 \ndoses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth \ninfusion of 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of \npatients 3 – 6 months after completion of last treatment. \n \nUpon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive \ninfusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 – 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 \nµg/mL (range, 171 – 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nRituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased \nto 500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 – 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/m2 \n\ninfusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 – 62 days). \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nFollowing two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 \nL). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger \nvolume of distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender-related \npharmacokinetic differences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not \nrequired. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg \nand 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were \ndose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following \nfirst infusion ranged from 157 to 171 μg/mL for 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 μg/mL \nfor 2 × 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 μg/mL for \nthe 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 μg/mL for the 2 × 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal \nelimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 × 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for \nthe 2 × 1000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared \n\n\n\n43  \n\nto the first infusion for both doses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg \nupon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion \nwas 170 to 175 μg/mL for 2 × 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 μg/mL for 2 × 1000 mg dose. Cmax \nfollowing second infusion, was 207 μg/mL for the 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 \nμg/mL for the 2 × 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, \nfollowing the second course, was 19 days for 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the \n2 × 1000 mg dose. PK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \nsame dosage regimen (2 × 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum \nconcentration of 369 μg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four \ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). \nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 \nL/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these \npatients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion \nof B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the \nfoetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the \nlymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied \nby a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these \nanimals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n \nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab.  \n\n \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general \ntoxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or \nfemales were observed. \n \n \n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nRitemvia is indicated in adults for the following indications:  \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) \n \nRitemvia is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular \nlymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nRitemvia maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients \nresponding to induction therapy. \n \nRitemvia monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma \nwho are chemo-resistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. \n \nRitemvia is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, \nprednisolone) chemotherapy. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \n\n\n\n47  \n\nRitemvia, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with \nsevere, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis \n(MPA). \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n\n \nRitemvia is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nRitemvia should be administered under the close supervision of an experienced healthcare \nprofessional, and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPremedication and prophylactic medications \n \nPremedication consisting of an anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and \ndiphenhydramine, should always be given before each administration of Ritemvia. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, premedication with glucocorticoids should be considered \nif Ritemvia is not given in combination with glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy. \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) or microscopic polyangiitis in disease \nremission or pemphigus vulgaris, premedication with 100 mg intravenous methylprednisolone should \nbe completed 30 minutes prior to Ritemvia infusions to decrease the incidence and severity of infusion \nrelated reactions (IRRs). \n \nIn patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) or microscopic polyangiitis, \nmethylprednisolone given intravenously for 1 to 3 days at a dose of 1000 mg per day is \nrecommended prior to the first infusion of Ritemvia (the last dose of methylprednisolone may be \ngiven on the same day as the first infusion of Ritemvia). This should be followed by oral prednisone \n1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 80 mg/day, and tapered as rapidly as possible based on clinical need) \nduring and after the 4 week induction course of Ritemvia treatment. \n \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for patients with GPA/MPA \nor PV during and following rituximab treatment, as appropriate according to local clinical practice \nguidelines. \n \nPosology \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nFollicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nCombination therapy \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia in combination with chemotherapy for induction treatment of \npreviously untreated or relapsed/ refractory patients with follicular lymphoma is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area per cycle, for up to 8 cycles. \nRitemvia should be administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle, after intravenous \nadministration of the glucocorticoid component of the chemotherapy if applicable. \n\n \nMaintenance therapy \n\n• Previously untreated follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia used as a maintenance treatment for patients with previously \nuntreated follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 body \nsurface area once every 2 months (starting 2 months after the last dose of induction therapy) until \ndisease progression or for a maximum period of two years (12 infusions in total). \n\n\n\n48  \n\n \n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \n\nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia used as a maintenance treatment for patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have responded to induction treatment is: 375 mg/m2 \nbody surface area once every 3 months (starting 3 months after the last dose of induction therapy) \nuntil disease progression or for a maximum period of two years (8 infusions in total). \n\n \nMonotherapy \n\n• Relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma \nThe recommended dose of Ritemvia monotherapy used as induction treatment for adult patients with \nstage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse \nafter chemotherapy is: 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once \nweekly for 4 weeks. \n \nFor retreatment with Ritemvia monotherapy for patients who have responded to previous treatment \nwith Ritemvia monotherapy for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, the recommended dose is: \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma \n \nRitemvia should be used in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. The recommended dosage is \n375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle for 8 cycles after \nintravenous infusion of the glucocorticoid component of CHOP. Safety and efficacy of Ritemvia \nhave not been established in combination with other chemotherapies in diffuse large B cell \nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n \nDose adjustments during treatment \n \nNo dose reductions of Ritemvia are recommended. When Ritemvia is given in combination with \nchemotherapy, standard dose reductions for the chemotherapeutic medicinal products should be \napplied. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nPatients treated with Ritemvia must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nInduction of remission \nThe recommended dosage of Ritemvia for induction of remission therapy of granulomatosis \nwith polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis is 375 mg/m2 body surface area, administered as \nan intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (four infusions in total). \n \nMaintenance treatment \nFollowing induction of remission with Ritemvia, maintenance treatment should be initiated no \nsooner than 16 weeks after the last Ritemvia infusion. \n\n \nFollowing induction of remission with other standard of care immunosuppressants, Ritemvia \nmaintenance treatment should be initiated during the 4 week period that follows disease \nremission.  \n\n \nRitemvia should be administered as two 500 mg IV infusions separated by two weeks, followed \nby a 500 mg IV infusion every 6 months thereafter. Patients should receive Ritemvia for at least \n24 months after achievement of remission (absence of clinical signs and symptoms). For patients \nwho may be at higher risk for relapse, physicians should consider a longer duration of Ritemvia \nmaintenance therapy, up to 5 years.  \n \nPemphigus vulgaris \n\n\n\n49  \n\n \nPatients treated with Ritemvia must be given the patient alert card with each infusion. \n \nThe recommended dosage of Ritemvia for the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris is 1000 mg \nadministered as an IV infusion followed two weeks later by a second 1000 mg IV infusion in \ncombination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. \n \nMaintenance treatment \nA maintenance infusion of 500 mg IV should be administered at months 12 and 18, and then every 6 \nmonths thereafter if needed, based on clinical evaluation. \n \nTreatment of relapse \nIn the event of relapse, patients may receive 1000 mg IV. The healthcare provider should also consider \nresuming or increasing the patient’s glucocorticoid dose based on clinical evaluation.  \n \nSubsequent infusions may be administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged >65 years). \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Ritemvia in children below 18 years has not been established. No data \nare available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe prepared Ritemvia solution should be administered as an intravenous infusion through \na dedicated line. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. \n \nPatients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome (see section 4.4). \nPatients who develop evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnoea, bronchospasm or \nhypoxia should have the infusion interrupted immediately. Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \nshould then be evaluated for evidence of tumour lysis syndrome including appropriate laboratory \ntests and, for pulmonary infiltration, with a chest X-ray. In all patients, the infusion should not be \nrestarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalisation of laboratory values and chest \nX-ray findings. At this time, the infusion can be initially resumed at not more than one-half the \nprevious rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occur for a second time, the decision to stop the \ntreatment should be seriously considered on a case by case basis. \n \nMild or moderate infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (section 4.8) usually respond to a \nreduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of \nsymptoms. \n \nFirst infusion \n \nThe recommended initial rate for infusion is 50 mg/h; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated \nin 50 mg/h increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \nSubsequent infusions \n \nAll indications \n \nSubsequent doses of Ritemvia can be infused at an initial rate of 100 mg/h, and increased by \n100 mg/h increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/h. \n \n\n\n\n50  \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nContraindications for use in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nContraindications for use in rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic \npolyangiitis and pemphigus vulgaris \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the other excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \nActive, severe infections (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients in a severely immunocompromised state. \n \nSevere heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease \n(see section 4.4 regarding other cardiovascular diseases). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded (or stated) in the patient file. \n \nExcipients: This medicinal product contains 11.5 mmol (or 263.2 mg) sodium per 50 mL vial. To be \ntaken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n \nAll patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, \nmicroscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris must be given the patient alert card with each \ninfusion. The alert card contains important safety information for patients regarding potential \nincreased risk of infections, including PML. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal PML have been reported following the use of rituximab. Patients must be \nmonitored at regular intervals for any new or worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be \nsuggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been \nexcluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of \nneurological dysfunction, and if so, whether these symptoms are possibly suggestive of PML. \nConsultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. \n \nIf any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. \n \nThe physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not \nnotice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to \ninform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the \npatient is not aware of. \n \nIf a patient develops PML the dosing of rituximab must be permanently discontinued.  \n \nFollowing reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML, \n\n\n\n51  \n\nstabilisation or improved outcome has been seen. It remains unknown if early detection of PML \nand suspension of rituximab therapy may lead to similar stabilisation or improved outcome. \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion-related reactions, which may be related to release of cytokines \nand/or other chemical mediators. Cytokine release syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable \nfrom acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n \nThis set of reactions which includes syndrome of cytokine release, tumour lysis syndrome and \nanaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions are described below.  \n \nSevere infusion-related reactions with fatal outcome have been reported during post-marketing use \nof the rituximab intravenous formulation, with an onset ranging within 30 minutes to 2 hours after \nstarting the first rituximab intravenous infusion. They were characterised by pulmonary events and \nin some cases included rapid tumour lysis and features of tumour lysis syndrome in addition to \nfever, chills, rigors, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema and other symptoms (see section 4.8). \n \nSevere cytokine release syndrome is characterised by severe dyspnoea, often accompanied by \nbronchospasm and hypoxia, in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and angioedema. This \nsyndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricaemia, \nhyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) and may be associated with acute respiratory failure and death. The acute \nrespiratory failure may be accompanied by events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration or \noedema, visible on a chest X-ray. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours \nof initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency or those with \npulmonary tumour infiltration may be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be treated with \nincreased caution. Patients who develop severe cytokine release syndrome should have their infusion \ninterrupted immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment. \nSince initial improvement of clinical symptoms may be followed by deterioration, these patients \nshould be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration have been \nresolved or ruled out. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms \nhas rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. \n \nPatients with a high tumour burden or with a high number (≥25 x 109/L) of circulating malignant \ncells such as patients with CLL, who may be at higher risk of especially severe cytokine release \nsyndrome, should be treated with extreme caution. These patients should be very closely monitored \nthroughout the first infusion. Consideration should be given to the use of a reduced infusion rate for \nthe first infusion in these patients or a split dosing over two days during the first cycle and any \nsubsequent cycles if the lymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. \n \nInfusion related adverse reactions of all kinds have been observed in 77% of patients treated with \nrituximab (including cytokine release syndrome accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in \n10% of patients) see section 4.8. These symptoms are usually reversible with interruption of \nrituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistaminic, and, occasionally, \noxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. Please see cytokine \nrelease syndrome above for severe reactions. \n \nAnaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following the intravenous \nadministration of proteins to patients. In contrast to cytokine release syndrome, true hypersensitivity \nreactions typically occur within minutes after starting infusion. Medicinal products for the treatment \nof hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), antihistamines and glucocorticoids, \nshould be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic reaction during administration of \nrituximab. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of \nthe cytokine release syndrome (described above). Reactions attributed to hypersensitivity have been \nreported less frequently than those attributed to cytokine release. \n\n\n\n52  \n\nAdditional reactions reported in some cases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary \noedema and acute reversible thrombocytopenia. \n \nSince hypotension may occur during rituximab administration, consideration should be given to \nwithholding anti-hypertensive medicines 12 hours prior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore, patients with a \nhistory of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be monitored closely. \n \nHaematological toxicities \nAlthough rituximab is not myelosuppressive in monotherapy, caution should be exercised when \nconsidering treatment of patients with neutrophils < 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet counts < 75 x 109/L \nas clinical experience in this population is limited. Rituximab has been used in 21 patients who \nunderwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and other risk groups with a presumable \nreduced bone marrow function without inducing myelotoxicity. \n \nRegular full blood counts, including neutrophil and platelet counts, should be performed during \nrituximab therapy. \n \nInfections \nSerious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy with rituximab (see section 4.8). \nRituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection (e.g. tuberculosis, \nsepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3). \nPhysicians should exercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history \nof recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose \npatients to serious infection (see section 4.8). \n \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in subjects receiving rituximab including \nfulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome. The majority of these subjects were also exposed to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy. Limited information from one study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients suggests that \nrituximab treatment may also worsen the outcome of primary hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B virus \n(HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with rituximab. At \nminimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be complemented with \nother appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease should not \nbe treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) \nshould consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed \nfollowing local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n \nVery rare cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported during \npost-marketing use of rituximab in NHL and CLL (see section 4.8). The majority of patients had \nreceived rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a haematopoietic stem cell \ntransplant. \n \nImmunisations \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines, following rituximab therapy has not been \nstudied for NHL and CLL patients and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended. \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, with non-live vaccines \nresponse rates may be reduced. In a non-randomised study, patients with relapsed low-grade NHL \nwho received rituximab monotherapy when compared to healthy untreated controls had a lower rate \nof response to vaccination with tetanus recall antigen (16% vs. 81%) and Keyhole Limpet \nHaemocyanin (KLH) neoantigen (4% vs. 76% when assessed for >2-fold increase in antibody titer). \nFor CLL patients similar results are assumable considering similarities between both diseases but \nthat has not been investigated in clinical trials. \n \n \n\n\n\n53  \n\nMean pre-therapeutic antibody titres against a panel of antigens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza \nA, mumps, rubella, varicella) were maintained for at least 6 months after treatment with rituximab. \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In case of such an event, \nwith a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently discontinued. \n \nRheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and pemphigus \nvulgaris \n \nMethotrexate (MTX) naïve populations with rheumatoid arthritis \nThe use of rituximab is not recommended in MTX-naïve patients since a favourable benefit risk \nrelationship has not been established. \n \nInfusion related reactions \nRituximab is associated with infusion related reactions (IRRs), which may be related to release of \ncytokines and/or other chemical mediators.  \n \nSevere IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients in the \npost-marketing setting. In rheumatoid arthritis most infusion-related events reported in clinical trials \nwere mild to moderate in severity. The most common symptoms were allergic reactions like \nheadache, pruritus, throat irritation, flushing, rash, urticaria, hypertension, and pyrexia. In general, \nthe proportion of patients experiencing any infusion reaction was higher following the first infusion \nthan following the second infusion of any treatment course. The incidence of IRR decreased with \nsubsequent courses (see section 4.8). The reactions reported were usually reversible with a reduction \nin rate, or interruption, of rituximab infusion and administration of an anti-pyretic, an antihistamine, \nand, occasionally, oxygen, intravenous saline or bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids if required. \nClosely monitor patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions and those who experienced prior \ncardiopulmonary adverse reactions. Depending on the severity of the IRR and the required \ninterventions, temporarily or permanently discontinue rituximab. In most cases, the infusion can be \nresumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h) when symptoms have \ncompletely resolved. \n \nMedicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. epinephrine (adrenaline), \nantihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be available for immediate use in the event of an allergic \nreaction during administration of rituximab. \n \nThere are no data on the safety of rituximab in patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class III) \nor severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease. In patients treated with rituximab, the occurrence of \npre-existing ischemic cardiac conditions becoming symptomatic, such as angina pectoris, has been \nobserved, as well as atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in patients with a known cardiac history, \nand those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions the risk of cardiovascular \ncomplications resulting from infusion reactions should be considered before treatment with rituximab \nand patients closely monitored during administration. Since hypotension may occur during rituximab \ninfusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medicinal product 12 hours \nprior to the rituximab infusion. \n \nIRRs for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and pemphigus \nvulgaris were consistent with those seen for rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nCardiac disorders \nAngina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and fibrillation, heart failure and/or \nmyocardial infarction have occurred in patients treated with rituximab. Therefore patients with \na history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely (see Infusion related reactions, above). \n \n\n\n\n54  \n\nInfections \nBased on the mechanism of action of rituximab and the knowledge that B cells play an important \nrole in maintaining normal immune response, patients have an increased risk of infection following \nrituximab therapy (see section 5.1). Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur during therapy \nwith rituximab (see section 4.8). Rituximab should not be administered to patients with an active, \nsevere infection (e.g. tuberculosis, sepsis and opportunistic infections, see section 4.3) or severely \nimmunocompromised patients (e.g. where levels of CD4 or CD8 are very low). Physicians should \nexercise caution when considering the use of rituximab in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose patients to serious \ninfection, e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia (see section 4.8). It is recommended that immunoglobulin \nlevels are determined prior to initiating treatment with rituximab. \n \nPatients reporting signs and symptoms of infection following rituximab therapy should be promptly \nevaluated and treated appropriately. Before giving a subsequent course of rituximab treatment, \npatients should be re-evaluated for any potential risk for infections. \n \nVery rare cases of fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases \nincluding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. \n \nHepatitis B Infections \nCases of hepatitis B reactivation, including those with a fatal outcome, have been reported in \nrheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving \nrituximab. \n \nHepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment \nwith rituximab. At minimum this should include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These can be \ncomplemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B \ndisease should not be treated with rituximab. Patients with positive hepatitis B serology (either \nHBsAg or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be \nmonitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. \n\n \nLate neutropenia \nMeasure blood neutrophils prior to each course of rituximab, and regularly up to 6-months \nafter cessation of treatment, and upon signs or symptoms of infection (see section 4.8). \n \nSkin reactions \nSevere skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and \nStevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see section 4.8). In \ncase of such an event with a suspected relationship to rituximab, treatment should be permanently \ndiscontinued. \n \nImmunisation \nPhysicians should review the patient’s vaccination status and follow current immunisation \nguidelines prior to rituximab therapy. Vaccination should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to \nfirst administration of rituximab. \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied. \nTherefore vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended whilst on rituximab or whilst \nperipherally B cell depleted. \n \nPatients treated with rituximab may receive non-live vaccinations. However, response rates to non-live \nvaccines may be reduced. In a randomised trial, patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \nrituximab and methotrexate had comparable response rates to tetanus recall antigen (39% vs. 42%), \nreduced rates to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (43% vs. 82% to at least 2 pneumococcal \nantibody serotypes), and KLH neoantigen (47% vs. 93%), when given 6 months after rituximab as \ncompared to patients only receiving methotrexate. Should non-live vaccinations be required whilst \n\n\n\n55  \n\nreceiving rituximab therapy, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next \ncourse of rituximab. \n \nIn the overall experience of rituximab repeat treatment over one year in rheumatoid arthritis, the \nproportions of patients with positive antibody titres against S. pneumoniae, influenza, mumps, \nrubella, varicella and tetanus toxoid were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. \n \nConcomitant/sequential use of other DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis \nThe concomitant use of rituximab and anti-rheumatic therapies other than those specified under the \nrheumatoid arthritis indication and posology is not recommended. \n \nThere are limited data from clinical trials to fully assess the safety of the sequential use of other \nDMARDs (including TNF inhibitors and other biologics) following rituximab (see section 4.5). The \navailable data indicate that the rate of clinically relevant infection is unchanged when such \ntherapies are used in patients previously treated with rituximab, however patients should be closely \nobserved for signs of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used following rituximab \ntherapy. \n \nMalignancy \nImmunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of \nlimited experience with rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see section 4.8) the present data \ndo not seem to suggest any increased risk of malignancy. However, the possible risk for the \ndevelopment of solid tumours cannot be excluded at this time. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nCurrently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with rituximab. \n \nIn CLL patients, co-administration with rituximab did not appear to have an effect on the \npharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of \nfludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n \nCo-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab \nin rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n\n \nPatients with human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti-drug antibody (ADA) titres may have \nallergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic \nmonoclonal antibodies. \n \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic \nDMARD following rituximab. In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on \nrituximab was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment \nwith the biologic DMARD. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nDue to the long retention time of rituximab in B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing \npotential should use effective contraceptive methods during and for 12 months following \ntreatment with rituximab. \n \nPregnancy \n \nIgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. \nB cell levels in human neonates following maternal exposure to rituximab have not been studied in \nclinical trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant women, \n\n\n\n56  \n\nhowever transient B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in some infants born to \nmothers exposed to rituximab during pregnancy. Similar effects have been observed in animal studies \n(see section 5.3). For these reasons rituximab should not be administered to pregnant women unless \nthe possible benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nWhether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is \nexcreted in human milk, and rituximab was detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, women \nshould not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies did not reveal deleterious effects of rituximab on reproductive organs. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects of rituximab on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed, \nalthough the pharmacological activity and adverse reactions reported to date suggest that rituximab \nwould have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nExperience from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and CLL is based on data from \npatients from clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. These patients were treated either \nwith rituximab monotherapy (as induction treatment or maintenance treatment following induction \ntreatment) or in combination with chemotherapy. \n \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving rituximab were \nIRRs which occurred in the majority of patients during the first infusion. The incidence of \ninfusion-related symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions and is less than 1% after \neight doses of rituximab. \n\n \nInfectious events (predominantly bacterial and viral) occurred in approximately 30-55% of \npatients during clinical trials in patients with NHL and in 30-50% of patients during clinical trials \nin patients with CLL \n \nThe most frequent reported or observed serious adverse drug reactions were: \n IRRs (including cytokine-release syndrome, tumour-lysis syndrome), see section 4.4. \n Infections, see section 4.4. \n Cardiovascular events, see section 4.4. \n \nOther serious ADRs reported include hepatitis B reactivation and PML (see section 4.4.) \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe frequencies of ADRs reported with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy \nare summarised in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in \norder of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ \n1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< \n1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nThe ADRs identified only during post-marketing surveillance, and for which a frequency could \n\n\n\n57  \n\nnot be estimated, are listed under “not known”. \n \nTable 1  ADRs reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing surveillance in  \n\npatients with NHL and CLL disease treated with rituximab \nmonotherapy/maintenance or in combination with chemotherapy \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \ncommon Common Uncommon Rare Very Rare Not known \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nbacterial \ninfection, \nviral infections, \n+bronchitis \n\nsepsis, \n+pneumonia, \n+febrile \ninfection, \n+herpes zoster, \n+respiratory \ntract infection, \nfungal \ninfections, \ninfections of \nunknown \naetiology, \n+acute \nbronchitis, \n+sinusitis, \nhepatitis B1 \n\n serious \nviral \ninfection2 \npneumocys\ntis jirovecii \n\nPML  \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\nneutropenia, \nleucopenia, \n+febrile \nneutropenia, \n+thrombocytope\nnia \n\nanaemia, \n+pancytopenia, \n+granulocytope\nnia \n\ncoagulation \ndisorders, \naplastic \nanaemia, \nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nlymphadenopa\nthy \n\n transient \nincrease in \nserum IgM \nlevels3 \n\nlate \nneutropenia3 \n\nImmune \nsystem \ndisorders \n\ninfusion \nrelated \nreactions4, \nangioedema \n\nhypersensitivit\ny \n\n anaphylaxi\ns \n\ntumour lysis \nsyndrome, \ncytokine \nrelease \nsyndrome4, \nserum \nsickness \n\ninfusion-related \nacute reversible \nthrombocytope\nnia4 \n\nMetabolism \nand nutrition \ndisorders \n\n hyperglycaemi\na, \nweight \ndecrease, \nperipheral \noedema, face \noedema, \nincreased \nLDH, \nhypocalcaemia \n\n    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n  depression, \nnervousness, \n\n   \n\nNervous \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n paraesthesia, \nhypoaesthesia, \nagitation, \ninsomnia, \nvasodilatation, \ndizziness, \nanxiety \n\ndysgeusia  peripheral \nneuropathy, \nfacial nerve \npalsy5 \n\ncranial \nneuropathy, \nloss of other \nsenses5 \n\nEye disorders  lacrimation \ndisorder, \nconjunctivitis \n\n  severe vision \nloss5 \n\n \n\nEar and \nlabyrinth \ndisorders \n\n tinnitus, ear \npain \n\n   hearing loss5 \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n +myocardial \ninfarction4 and 6, \narrhythmia, \n+atrial \nfibrillation, \n\n+left \nventricular \nfailure, \n+supraventri-\ncular \n\nsevere \ncardiac \ndisorders4 \nand 6 \n\nheart failure4 \nand 6 \n\n \n\n\n\n58  \n\ntachycardia, \n+cardiac \ndisorder \n\ntachycardia, \n+ventricular \ntachycardia, \n+angina, \n+myocardial \nischaemia, \nbradycardia \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\n hypertension, \northostatic \nhypotension, \nhypotension \n\n  vasculitis \n(predominate\nly \ncutaneous), \nleukocytoclas\ntic vasculitis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n bronchospasm4\n, respiratory \ndisease, chest \npain, dyspnoea, \nincreased \ncough, rhinitis \n\nasthma, \nbronchiolitis \nobliterans, \nlung disorder, \nhypoxia \n\ninterstitial \nlung \ndisease7 \n\nrespiratory \nfailure4 \n\nlung infiltration \n\nGastrointestin\nal disorders \n\nnausea vomiting , \ndiarrhoea, \nabdominal \npain, \ndysphagia, \nstomatitis, \nconstipation, \ndyspepsia, \nanorexia, throat \nirritation \n\nabdominal \nenlargement \n\n gastro-intesti\nnal \nperforation7 \n\n \n\nSkin and \nSubcutaneous \ntissue \ndisorders \n\npruritus, \nrash, \n+alopecia \n\nurticaria, \nsweating, night \nsweats, +skin \ndisorder \n\n  severe \nbullous \nskin \nreactions, \nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nsyndrome)7 \n\n \n\nMusculoskelet\nal, connective \ntissue and \nbone \ndisorders \n\n hypertonia, \nmyalgia, \narthralgia, back \npain, neck \npain, pain \n\n    \n\nRenal and \nurinary \ndisorders \n\n    renal failure4  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministratio\nn site \nconditions \n\nfever, chills, \nasthenia, \nheadache \n\ntumour pain, \nflushing, \nmalaise, \ncold syndrome, \n+fatigue, \n+shivering, \n+multi-organ \nfailure4 \n\ninfusion site \npain \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased \nIgG levels \n\n     \n\nFor each term, the frequency count was based on reactions of all grades (from mild to severe), except for terms marked \nwith \"+\" where the frequency count was based only on severe (≥ grade 3 NCI common toxicity criteria) reactions.

Rarely fatal cases reported \n5 signs and symptoms of cranial neuropathy. Occurred at various times up to several months after completion of rituximab \ntherapy \n6 observed mainly in patients with prior cardiac condition and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and were mostly associated \n\n\n\n59  \n\nwith infusion-related reactions \n7 includes fatal cases \n\n \nThe following terms have been reported as adverse events during clinical trials, however, \nwere reported at a similar or lower incidence in the rituximab-arms compared to control \narms: haematotoxicity, neutropenic infection, urinary tract infection, sensory disturbance, \npyrexia. \n \nSigns and symptoms suggestive of an infusion-related reaction were reported in more than 50% of \npatients in clinical trials, and were predominantly seen during the first infusion, usually in the first one \nto two hours. These symptoms mainly comprised fever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms included \nflushing, angioedema, bronchospasm, vomiting, nausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat \nirritation, rhinitis, pruritus, pain, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, \nasthenia and features of tumour lysis syndrome. Severe infusion-related reactions (such as \nbronchospasm, hypotension) occurred in up to 12% of the cases. Additional reactions reported in some \ncases were myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and acute reversible \nthrombocytopenia. Exacerbations of pre-existing cardiac conditions such as angina pectoris or \ncongestive heart failure or severe cardiac disorders (heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial \nfibrillation), pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure, tumour lysis syndrome, cytokine release \nsyndrome, renal failure, and respiratory failure were reported at lower or unknown frequencies. The \nincidence of infusion-related symptoms decreased substantially with subsequent infusions and is < 1% \nof patients by the eighth cycle of rituximab-containing treatment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfections \nRituximab induces B-cell depletion in about 70-80% of patients, but was associated with \ndecreased serum immunoglobulins only in a minority of patients. \n \nLocalised candida infections as well as Herpes zoster were reported at a higher incidence in \nthe rituximab-containing arm of randomised studies. Severe infections were reported in about \n4% of patients treated with rituximab monotherapy. Higher frequencies of infections overall, \nincluding grade 3 or 4 infections, were observed during rituximab maintenance treatment up \nto 2 years when compared to observation. There was no cumulative toxicity in terms of \ninfections reported over a 2-year treatment period. In addition, other serious viral infections \neither new, reactivated or exacerbated, some of which were fatal, have been reported with \nrituximab treatment. The majority of patients had received rituximab in combination with \nchemotherapy or as part of a haematopoetic stem cell transplant. Examples of these serious \nviral infections are infections caused by the herpes viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster \nVirus and Herpes Simplex Virus), JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy \n(PML)) and hepatitis C virus. Cases of fatal PML that occurred after disease progression and \nretreatment have also been reported in clinical trials. Cases of hepatitis B reactivation, have \nbeen reported, the majority of which were in patients receiving rituximab in combination with \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, the incidence of grade 3/4 \nhepatitis B infection (reactivation and primary infection) was 2% in R-FC vs. 0% FC. \nProgression of Kaposi’s sarcoma has been observed in rituximab-exposed patients with \npre-existing Kaposi’s sarcoma. These cases occurred in non-approved indications and the \nmajority of patients were HIV positive. \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions \nIn clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy given for 4 weeks, haematological abnormalities \noccurred in a minority of patients and were usually mild and reversible. Severe (grade 3/4) \nneutropenia was reported in 4.2%, anaemia in 1.1% and thrombocytopenia in 1.7% of the patients. \nDuring rituximab maintenance treatment for up to 2 years, leucopenia (5% vs. 2%, grade 3/4) and \nneutropenia (10% vs. 4%, grade 3/4) were reported at a higher incidence when compared to \nobservation. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was low (<1%, grade 3/4) and was not different \nbetween treatment arms. During the treatment course in studies with rituximab in combination with \n\n\n\n60  \n\nchemotherapy, grade 3/4 leucopenia (R-CHOP 88% vs. CHOP 79%, R-FC 23% vs. FC 12%), \nneutropenia (R-CVP 24% vs. CVP 14%; R-CHOP 97% vs. CHOP 88%, R-FC 30% vs. FC 19% in \npreviously untreated CLL), pancytopenia (R-FC 3% vs. FC 1% in previously untreated CLL) were \nusually reported with higher frequencies when compared to chemotherapy alone. However, the \nhigher incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rituximab and chemotherapy was not \nassociated with a higher incidence of infections and infestations compared to patients treated with \nchemotherapy alone. Studies in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL have established \nthat in up to 25% of patients treated with R-FC neutropenia was prolonged (defined as neutrophil \ncount remaining below 1×109/L between day 24 and 42 after the last dose) or occurred with a late \nonset (defined as neutrophil count below 1×109/L later than 42 days after last dose in patients with \nno previous prolonged neutropenia or who recovered prior to day 42) following treatment with \nrituximab plus FC. There were no differences reported for the incidence of anaemia. Some cases of \nlate neutropenia occurring more than four weeks after the last infusion of rituximab were reported. \nIn the CLL first-line study, Binet stage C patients experienced more adverse events in the R-FC arm \ncompared to the FC arm (R-FC 83% vs. FC 71%). In the relapsed/refractory CLL study grade 3/4 \nthrombocytopenia was reported in 11% of patients in the R-FC group compared to 9% of patients in \nthe FC group. \n \nIn studies of rituximab in patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia, transient increases in \nserum IgM levels have been observed following treatment initiation, which may be associated with \nhyperviscosity and related symptoms. The transient IgM increase usually returned to at least \nbaseline level within 4 months. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nCardiovascular reactions during clinical trials with rituximab monotherapy were reported in 18.8% of \npatients with the most frequently reported events being hypotension and hypertension. Cases of grade \n3 or 4 arrhythmia (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia) and angina pectoris during \ninfusion were reported. During maintenance treatment, the incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac disorders \nwas comparable between patients treated with rituximab and observation. Cardiac events were \nreported as serious adverse events (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, left ventricular \nfailure, myocardial ischaemia) in 3% of patients treated with rituximab compared to <1% on \nobservation. In studies evaluating rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, the incidence of \ngrade 3 and 4 cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular arrhythmias such as tachycardia \nand atrial flutter/fibrillation, was higher in the R-CHOP group (14 patients, 6.9%) as compared to the \nCHOP group (3 patients, 1.5%). All of these arrhythmias either occurred in the context of a rituximab \ninfusion or were associated with predisposing conditions such as fever, infection, acute myocardial \ninfarction or pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. No difference between the R-CHOP \nand CHOP group was observed in the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 cardiac events including heart \nfailure, myocardial disease and manifestations of coronary artery disease. In CLL, the overall \nincidence of grade 3 or 4 cardiac disorders was low both in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 3% FC) and \nin the relapsed/refractory study (4% R-FC, 4% FC). \n\n \nRespiratory system \nCases of interstitial lung disease, some with fatal outcome, have been reported. \n \nNeurologic disorders \nDuring the treatment period (induction treatment phase comprising of R-CHOP for at most eight \ncycles), four patients (2%) treated with R-CHOP, all with cardiovascular risk factors, experienced \nthromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents during the first treatment cycle. There was no difference \nbetween the treatment groups in the incidence of other thromboembolic events. In contrast, three \npatients (1.5%) had cerebrovascular events in the CHOP group, all of which occurred during the \nfollow-up period. In CLL, the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 nervous system disorders was low \nboth in the first-line study (4% R-FC, 4% FC) and in the relapsed/refractory study (3% R-FC, 3% \nFC). \n \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \n\n\n\n61  \n\ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nGastrointestinal perforation in some cases leading to death has been observed in patients receiving \nrituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, rituximab was \nadministered with chemotherapy. \n \nIgG levels \nIn the clinical trial evaluating rituximab maintenance treatment in relapsed/refractory follicular \nlymphoma, median IgG levels were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (< 7 g/L) after induction \ntreatment in both the observation and the rituximab groups. In the observation group, the median IgG \nlevel subsequently increased to above the LLN, but remained constant in the rituximab group. The \nproportion of patients with IgG levels below the LLN was about 60% in the rituximab group \nthroughout the 2 year treatment period, while it decreased in the observation group (36% after \n2 years). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been \nobserved in paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nPatient subpopulations - rituximab monotherapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years): \nThe incidence of ADRs of all grades and grade 3/4 ADR was similar in elderly patients compared \nto younger patients (< 65 years). \n \nBulky disease \nThere was a higher incidence of grade 3/4 ADRs in patients with bulky disease than in patients \nwithout bulky disease (25.6% vs. 15.4%). The incidence of ADRs of any grade was similar in these \ntwo groups. \n \nRe-treatment \nThe percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon re-treatment with further courses of rituximab was \nsimilar to the percentage of patients reporting ADRs upon initial exposure (any grade and grade 3/4 \nADRs). \n\n \nPatient subpopulations - rituximab combination therapy \nElderly patients (≥ 65 years) \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 blood and lymphatic adverse events was higher in elderly patients \ncompared to younger patients (< 65 years), with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory \nCLL. \n \nExperience from rheumatoid arthritis \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe overall safety profile of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis is based on data from patients from \nclinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance. \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is \n\n\n\n62  \n\nsummarised in the sections below. In clinical trials more than 3100 patients received at least one \ntreatment course and were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to over 5 years; \napproximately 2400 patients received two or more courses of treatment with over 1000 having \nreceived 5 or more courses. The safety information collected during post-marketing experience \nreflects the expected adverse reaction profile as seen in clinical trials for rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients received 2 × 1000 mg of rituximab separated by an interval of two weeks; in addition to \nmethotrexate (10-25 mg/week). Rituximab infusions were administered after an intravenous infusion \nof 100 mg methylprednisolone; patients also received treatment with oral prednisone for 15 days. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 2. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common \n(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100) and very rare (< 1/10000). Within each \nfrequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nThe most frequent adverse reactions considered due to receipt of rituximab were IRRs. The overall \nincidence of IRRs in clinical trials was 23% with the first infusion and decreased with subsequent \ninfusions. Serious IRRs were uncommon (0.5% of patients) and were predominantly seen during \nthe initial course. In addition to adverse reactions seen in RA clinical trials for rituximab, \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (see section 4.4) and serum sickness-like \nreaction have been reported during post marketing experience. \n \nTable 2 Summary of adverse drug reactions reported in clinical trials or during \n\npost-marketing surveillance occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nreceiving rituximab \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nInfections and \ninfestations \n\nupper \nrespiratory \ntract infection, \nurinary tract \ninfections \n\nbronchitis, sinusitis, \ngastroenteritis, tinea \npedis \n\n  PML, \nreactivation of \nhepatitis B \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic \nsystem \ndisorders \n\n neutropenia1  late neutropenia2 serum \nsickness-like \nreaction \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n3infusion-related \nreactions \n(hypertension, \nnausea, rash, \npyrexia, \npruritus, \nurticaria, throat \nirritation, hot \nflush, \nhypotension, \nrhinitis, rigors, \ntachycardia, \nfatigue, \noropharyngeal \npain, peripheral \noedema, \nerythma) \n\n 3infusion related \nreactions \n(generalised \noedema, \nbronchospasm, \nwheezing, \nlaryngeal \noedema, \nangioneurotic \noedema, \ngeneralised \npruritis, \nanaphylaxis, \nanaphylactoid \nreaction) \n\n  \n\nGeneral \ndisorders and \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\nMetabolism and \nnutritional \ndisorders \n\n hypercholesterolemia    \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n depression, anxiety    \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache paraesthesia, \nmigraine, dizziness, \nsciatica \n\n   \n\nCardiac \ndisorders \n\n   angina pectoris, \natrial fibrillation, \nheart failure, \n\natrial flutter \n\n\n\n63  \n\nSystem organ \nclass \n\nVery \nCommon Common Uncommon Rare Very rare \n\nmyocardial \ninfarction \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\n dyspepsia, diarrhoea, \ngastro-oesophageal \nreflux, mouth \nulceration, upper \nabdominal pain \n\n   \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n alopecia   toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis \n(Lyell’s \nsyndrome), \nStevens-Johnson \nsyndrome5 \n\nMusculo-\nskeletal \ndisorders \n\n arthralgia / \nmusculoskeletal \npain, osteoarthritis, \nbursitis \n\n   \n\nInvestigations decreased IgM \nlevels4 \n\ndecreased IgG \nlevels4 \n\n   \n\n1 Frequency category derived from laboratory values collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring in clinical trials \n2 Frequency category derived from post-marketing data. \n3 Reactions occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion.

IRRs may occur as \na result of hypersensitivity and/or to the mechanism of action. \n4 Includes observations collected as part of routine laboratory monitoring. \n5 Includes fatal cases \n\n \nMultiple courses \nMultiple courses of treatment are associated with a similar ADR profile to that observed following \nfirst exposure. The rate of all ADRs following first rituximab exposure was highest during the first \n6 months and declined thereafter. This is mostly accounted for by IRRs (most frequent during the \nfirst treatment course), RA exacerbation and infections all of which were more frequent in the first \n6 months of treatment. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nThe most frequent ADRs following receipt of rituximab in clinical studies were IRRs (refer to Table \n2). Among the 3189 patients treated with rituximab, 1135 (36%) experienced at least one IRR with \n733/3189 (23%) of patients experiencing an IRR following first infusion of the first exposure to \nrituximab. The incidence of IRRs declined with subsequent infusions. In clinical trials fewer than \n1% (17/3189) of patients experienced a serious IRR. There were no CTC Grade 4 IRRs and no \ndeaths due to IRRs in the clinical trials. The proportion of CTC Grade 3 events, and of IRRs leading \nto withdrawal decreased by course and were rare from course 3 onwards. Premedication with \nintravenous glucocorticoid significantly reduced the incidence and severity of IRRs (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.4). Severe IRRs with fatal outcome have been reported in the post-marketing setting. \n \nIn a trial designed to evaluate the safety of a more rapid rituximab infusion in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who did not experience a serious \nIRR during or within 24 hours of their first studied infusion were allowed to receive a 2-hour \nintravenous infusion of rituximab. Patients with a history of a serious infusion reaction to a biologic \ntherapy for RA were excluded from entry. The incidence, types and severity of IRRs were consistent \nwith that observed historically. No serious IRRs were observed. \n \nInfections \nThe overall rate of infection was approximately 94 per 100 patient years in rituximab treated \npatients. The infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of upper \nrespiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The incidence of infections that were serious \nor required IV antibiotics, was approximately 4 per 100 patient years. The rate of serious infections \ndid not show any significant increase following multiple courses of rituximab. Lower respiratory \ntract infections (including pneumonia) have been reported during clinical trials, at a similar incidence \n\n\n\n64  \n\nin the rituximab-arms compared to control arms. \n \nCases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been reported \nfollowing use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This includes rheumatoid \narthritis and off-label autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and \nvasculitis. \n \nIn patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma receiving rituximab in combination with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy, cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported (see non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). \nReactivation of hepatitis B infection has also been very rarely reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients \nreceiving rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nSerious cardiac reactions were reported at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in the rituximab treated \npatients compared to 1.3 per 100 patient years in placebo treated patients. The proportions of patients \nexperiencing cardiac reactions (all or serious) did not increase over multiple courses. \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual \ndisturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A \ndiagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The reported cases had recognised \nrisk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, hypertension, \nimmunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \nNeutropenia \nEvents of neutropenia were observed with rituximab treatment, the majority of which were \ntransient and mild or moderate in severity. Neutropenia can occur several months after the \nadministration of rituximab (see section 4.4). \n \nIn placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials, 0.94% (13/1382) of rituximab treated patients and \n0.27% (2/731) of placebo-treated patients developed severe neutropenia. \n \nNeutropenic events, including severe late onset and persistent neutropenia, have been rarely reported \nin the post-marketing setting, some of which were associated with fatal infections. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA \npatients treated with rituximab. There was no increased rate in overall infections or serious infections \nafter the development of low IgG or IgM (see section 4.4). \n \nA small number of spontaneous and literature cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been observed \nin paediatric patients treated with rituximab, in some cases severe and requiring long-term \nimmunoglobulin substitution therapy. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric \npatients are unknown. \n \nExperience from granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nInduction of remission \n \n99 patients were treated for induction of remission of GPA and MPA in a clinical trial with rituximab \n(375 mg/m2, once weekly for 4 weeks) and glucocorticoids (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n65  \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe ADRs listed in Table 3 were all adverse events which occurred at an incidence of ≥ 5% in the \nrituximab group and at a higher frequency than the comparator group. \n \nTable 3 Adverse drug reactions occurring at 6-months in ≥ 5% of patients receiving \n\nrituximab for induction of remission of GPA and MPA, and at a higher \nfrequency than the comparator group. \n\nBody system \nAdverse Event \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nInfections and infestations \nUrinary tract infection 7% \nBronchitis 5% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nNasopharyngitis 5% \n\nBlood and lymphatic  \nsystem disorders \n\nThrombocytopenia 7% \nImmune system disorders \n\nCytokine release syndrome 5% \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nHyperkalaemia 5% \nPsychiatric disorders \n\nInsomnia 14% \nNervous system disorders \n\nDizziness 10% \nTremor 10% \n\nVascular disorders \nHypertension 12% \nFlushing 5% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and  \nmediastinal disorders \n\nCough 12% \nDyspnoea 11% \nEpistaxis 11% \nNasal congestion 6% \n\nGastrointestinal  \ndisorders \n\nDiarrhoea 18% \nDyspepsia 6% \nConstipation 5% \n\nSkin and subcutaneous  \ntissue disorders \n\nAcne 7% \nMusculoskeletal and connective  \ntissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms 18% \nArthralgia 15% \nBack pain 10% \nMuscle weakness 5% \nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nPain in extremities 5% \n\n\n\n66  \n\nBody system \nAdverse Event \n\nRituximab (n=99) \n\nGeneral disorders and  \nadministration site conditions \n\nPeripheral oedema 16% \nInvestigations \n\nDecreased haemoglobin 6% \n \nMaintenance treatment \n \nIn a further clinical study, a total of 57 severe active GPA and MPA patients in disease remission were \ntreated with rituximab for the maintenance of remission (see section 5.1) \n \nTable 4 Adverse drug reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of patients receiving rituximab for \n\nmaintenance treatment of GPA and MPA, and at a higher frequency than the \ncomparator group. \n\n \nSystem Organ Class \n\nAdverse drug reaction1 \nRituximab  \n\n(n=57) \nInfections and infestations   \n\nBronchitis 14% \nRhinitis 5% \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions  \n\nPyrexia 9% \nInfluenza-like illness 5% \nOedema peripheral 5% \n\nGastrointestinal disorders   \nDiarrhoea 7% \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\n \n\nDyspnoea 9% \nInjury, poisoning and procedural \ncomplications  \n\nInfusion related reactions2 12% \n1 Events were considered ADRs only after thorough assessment and where a causal relationship \nbetween the medicinal product and the adverse event was at least a reasonable possibility. \n2Details on infusion related reactions are provided in the description of selected adverse drug \nreactions section. \n\n \nThe overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile for rituximab in \napproved autoimmune indications, including GPA/MPA. Overall, 4% of patients in the rituximab arm \nexperienced adverse events leading to discontinuation. Most adverse events in the rituximab arm were \nmild or moderate in intensity. No patients in the rituximab arm had fatal adverse events. \n \nThe most commonly reported events considered as ADRs were infusion-related reactions and \ninfections.   \n \nIn a long-term observational safety study, 97 GPA/MPA patients received treatment with rituximab \n(mean of 8 infusions [range 1-28]) for up to 4 years, according to their physician’s standard practice \nand discretion. The overall safety profile was consistent with the well-established safety profile of \nrituximab in RA and GPA/MPA and no new adverse drug reactions were reported.    \n \n\n\n\n67  \n\nDescription of selected adverse drug reactions \n \nInfusion related reactions \nIn the clinical trial studying induction of remission with severe active GPA and MPA, IRRs were \ndefined as any adverse event occurring within 24 hours of an infusion and considered to be \ninfusion-related by investigators in the safety population. Of the 99 patients treated with rituximab, \n12 (12%) experienced at least one IRR. All IRRs were CTC Grade 1 or 2. The most common IRRs \nincluded cytokine release syndrome, flushing, throat irritation, and tremor. Rituximab was given in \ncombination with intravenous glucocorticoids which may reduce the incidence and severity of these \nevents. \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, 7/57 (12%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced at \nleast one infusion-related reaction. The incidence of IRR symptoms was highest during or after the \nfirst infusion (9%) and decreased with subsequent infusions (< 4%).  \n \nInfections \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, which included 99 rituximab-treated patients, the \noverall rate of infection was approximately 237 per 100 patient years (95% CI 197-285) at the 6-\nmonth primary endpoint. Infections were predominately mild to moderate and consisted mostly of \nupper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections. The rate of serious \ninfections was approximately 25 per 100 patient years. The most frequently reported serious \ninfection in the rituximab group was pneumonia at a frequency of 4%.  \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, 30/57 (53%) patients in the rituximab arm experienced \ninfections. The incidence of all grade infections was similar between the arms. Infections were \npredominately mild to moderate. The most common infections in the rituximab arm included upper \nrespiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections and herpes zoster. The incidence \nof serious infections was similar in both arms (approximately 12%). The most commonly reported \nserious infection in the rituximab group was mild or moderate bronchitis. \n \nMalignancies \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, the incidence of malignancy in rituximab-treated \npatients in the granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis clinical study was 2.00 \nper 100 patient years at the study common closing date (when the final patient had completed the \nfollow-up period). On the basis of standardised incidence ratios, the incidence of malignancies appears \nto be similar to that previously reported in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. \n \nCardiovascular adverse reactions \nIn the clinical trial on induction of remission, cardiac events occurred at a rate of approximately 273 \nper 100 patient years (95% CI 149-470) at the 6-month primary endpoint. The rate of serious cardiac \nevents was 2.1 per 100 patient years (95% CI 3-15). The most frequently reported events were \ntachycardia (4%) and atrial fibrillation (3%) (see section 4.4). \n \nNeurologic events \nCases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported in autoimmune conditions. Signs and \nsymptoms included visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without \nassociated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The \nreported cases had recognised risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including the patients’ underlying disease, \nhypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy. \n \nHepatitis B reactivation \nA small number of cases of hepatitis B reactivation, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients receiving rituximab in the post-\nmarketing setting. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \n\n\n\n68  \n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM below the lower limit of normal) has been observed in \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis patients treated with rituximab. The \nrate of overall infections or serious infections was not increased after the development of low IgA, \nIgG or IgM. \n \nIn the induction of remission clinical trial, at 6 months, in the rituixmab group, 27%, 58% and 51% \nof patients with normal immunoglobulin levels at baseline had low IgA, IgG and IgM levels, \nrespectively, compared to 25%, 50% and 46% in the cyclophosphamide group.  \n\n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, no clinically meaningful differences between the two \ntreatment arms or decreases in total immunoglobulin, IgG, IgM or IgA levels were observed \nthroughout the trial. \n \nNeutropenia \nIn the induction of remission clinical trial, 24% of patients in the rituximab group (single course) and \n23% of patients in the cyclophosphamide group developed CTC grade 3 or greater neutropenia. \nNeutropenia was not associated with an observed increase in serious infection in rituximab-treated \npatients.  \n \nIn the maintenance therapy clinical trial, the incidence of all-grade neutropenia was 0% for \nrituximab-treated patients vs. 5% for azathioprine treated patients. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nToxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some with fatal \noutcome, have been reported very rarely. \n \nExperience from pemphigus vulgaris \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of rituximab in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoids in the \ntreatment of patients with pemphigus vulgaris was studied in a Phase 3, randomised, controlled, \nmulticenter, open-label study in pemphigus patients that included 38 pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients \nrandomised to the rituximab group. Patients randomised to the rituximab group received an initial \n1000 mg IV on Study Day 1 and a second 1000 mg IV on Study Day 15. Maintenance doses of \n500 mg IV were administered at months 12 and 18. Patients could receive 1000 mg IV at the time of \nrelapse (see section 5.1).   \n\nThe safety profile of rituximab in patients with PV was consistent with that observed in RA and \nGPA/MPA patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse drug reactions presented in Table 5 were adverse events which occurred at a rate of ≥ 5% \namong rituximab-treated PV patients, with a ≥ 2% absolute difference in incidence between the \nrituximab-treated group and the standard-dose prednisone group up to month 24. No patients were \nwithdrawn due to ADRs. \n \nTable 5 Adverse drugs reactions for rituximab-treated pemphigus vulgaris patients from clinical \nstudy up to month 24 \n \nSystem Organ Class \n\nAdverse drug reaction \nrituximab + low-dose prednisone \n\n(n = 38) \nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural  \nComplications \n\nInfusion-related reactions* 58% \n\n\n\n69  \n\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue  \nDisorders \n\nAlopecia 13% \nPruritus 5% \nUrticaria 5% \nSkin disorder 5% \n\nPsychiatric Disorders \nPersistent depressive disorder 13% \nMajor depression 5% \nIrritability 5% \n\nInfections and Infestations \nHerpes virus infection 8% \nHerpes zoster 5% \nOral herpes 5% \nConjunctivitis 5% \n\nGeneral Disorders and Administration  \nSite Conditions \n\nFatigue 8% \nPyrexia 5% \n\nNervous System Disorders \nHeadache 5% \nDizziness 5% \n\nGastrointestinal Disorders \nAbdominal pain upper 5% \n\nCardiac Disorders \nTachycardia 5% \n\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue \nDisorders \n\nMusculoskeletal pain 5% \nNeoplasms Benign, Malignant and  \nUnspecified (incl cysts and polyps) \n\nSkin papilloma 5% \n* Infusion-related reactions included symptoms collected on the next scheduled visit after each infusion, and \n\nadverse events occurring on the day of or one day after the infusion. The most common infusion-related \nreaction symptoms/Preferred Terms included headaches, chills, high blood pressure, nausea, asthenia and \npain.  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nInfusion-related reactions \nInfusion-related reactions in the pemphigus vulgaris clinical study were common (58%). Nearly all \ninfusion-related reactions were mild to moderate. The proportion of patients experiencing an infusion- \nrelated reaction was 29% (11 patients), 40% (15 patients), 13% (5 patients), and 10% (4 patients) \nfollowing the first, second, third, and fourth infusions, respectively. No patients were withdrawn from \ntreatment due to infusion-related reactions. Symptoms of infusion-related reactions were similar in \ntype and severity to those seen in RA and GPA/MPA patients. \n \n\n\n\n70  \n\nInfections \n14 patients (37%) in the rituximab group experienced treatment-related infections compared to 15 \npatients (42%) in the standard-dose prednisone group. The most common infections in the rituximab \ngroup were herpes simplex and zoster infections, bronchitis, urinary tract infection, fungal infection \nand conjunctivitis. 3 patients (8%) in the rituximab group experienced a total of 5 serious infections \n(Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, infective thrombosis, intervertebral discitis, lung infection, \nStaphylococcal sepsis) and one patient (3%) in the standard-dose prednisone group experienced a \nserious infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nLimited experience with doses higher than the approved dose of intravenous rituximab formulation \nis available from clinical trials in humans. The highest intravenous dose of rituximab tested in \nhumans to date is 5000 mg (2250 mg/m2), tested in a dose escalation study in patients with CLL. No \nadditional safety signals were identified. \n \nPatients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption of their infusion and be closely \nmonitored. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting five cases of rituximab overdose have been reported. Three cases had \nno reported adverse event. The two adverse events that were reported were flu-like symptoms, with \na dose of 1.8 g of rituximab and fatal respiratory failure, with a dose of 2 g of rituximab. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC02.  \n \nRitemvia is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nRituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated \nphosphoprotein, located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on > 95% of \nall B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. \n \nCD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, \npro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalize \nupon antibody binding and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the \nplasma as a free antigen and, thus, does not compete for antibody binding. \n \nThe Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can \nrecruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector-mediated \ncell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and \nantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on \nthe surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B \nlymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. \n \nPeripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n71  \n\nIn patients treated for haematological malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 months of \ntreatment and generally returned to normal levels within 12 months after completion of therapy, \nalthough in some patients this may take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 months \npost-induction therapy). In rheumatoid arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells in the \nperipheral blood was observed following two infusions of 1000 mg rituximab separated by a 14 day \ninterval. Peripheral blood B cell counts begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for repopulation \nis observed in the majority of patients by week 40, whether rituximab was administered as \nmonotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients had prolonged \nperipheral B cell depletion lasting 2 years or more after their last dose of rituximab. In patients with \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of peripheral blood B cells \ndecreased to <10 cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that \nlevel in most patients up to the 6 month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B \ncell return, with counts >10 cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. \n \nClinical experience in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nFollicular lymphoma \n \nMonotherapy \nInitial treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn the pivotal trial, 166 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low-grade or follicular B cell NHL \nreceived 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks. The overall \nresponse rate (ORR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 48% (CI95% 41% - 56%) with a 6% \ncomplete response (CR) and a 42% partial response (PR) rate. The projected median time to \nprogression (TTP) for responding patients was 13.0 months. In a subgroup analysis, the ORR was \nhigher in patients with IWF B, C, and D histological subtypes as compared to IWF A subtype (58% \nvs. 12%), higher in patients whose largest lesion was < 5 cm vs. > 7 cm in greatest diameter (53% vs. \n38%), and higher in patients with chemosensitive relapse as compared to chemoresistant (defined as \nduration of response < 3 months) relapse (50% vs. 22%). ORR in patients previously treated with \nautologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) was 78% versus 43% in patients with no ABMT. \nNeither age, sex, lymphoma grade, initial diagnosis, presence nor absence of bulky disease, normal \nor high LDH nor presence of extranodal disease had a statistically significant effect (Fisher’s exact \ntest) on response to rituximab. A statistically significant correlation was noted between response \nrates and bone marrow involvement. 40% of patients with bone marrow involvement responded \ncompared to 59% of patients with no bone marrow involvement (p=0.0186). This finding was not \nsupported by a stepwise logistic regression analysis in which the following factors were identified as \nprognostic factors: histological type, bcl-2 positivity at baseline, resistance to last chemotherapy and \nbulky disease. \n \nInitial treatment, weekly for 8 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 37 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for eight doses. The \nORR was 57% (95% Confidence interval (CI); 41% – 73%; CR 14%, PR 43%) with a projected \nmedian TTP for responding patients of 19.4 months (range 5.3 to 38.9 months). \n \nInitial treatment, bulky disease, weekly for 4 doses \nIn pooled data from three trials, 39 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant, bulky disease (single \nlesion ≥ 10 cm in diameter), low grade or follicular B cell NHL received 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as \nintravenous infusion weekly for four doses. The ORR was 36% (CI95% 21% – 51%; CR 3%, PR \n33%) with a median TTP for responding patients of 9.6 months (range 4.5 to 26.8 months). \n \nRe-treatment, weekly for 4 doses \nIn a multicentre, single-arm trial, 58 patients with relapsed or chemoresistant low grade or follicular \nB cell NHL, who had achieved an objective clinical response to a prior course of rituximab, were \nre-treated with 375 mg/m2 of rituximab as intravenous infusion weekly for four doses. Three of the \npatients had received two courses of rituximab before enrolment and thus were given a third course \nin the study. Two patients were re-treated twice in the study. For the 60 re-treatments on study, the \n\n\n\n72  \n\nORR was 38% (CI95% 26% – 51%; 10% CR, 28% PR) with a projected median TTP for responding \npatients of 17.8 months (range 5.4 – 26.6). This compares favourably with the TTP achieved after \nthe prior course of rituximab (12.4 months). \n \nInitial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy \nIn an open-label randomised trial, a total of 322 previously untreated patients with follicular \nlymphoma were randomised to receive either CVP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, \nvincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 mg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on \ndays 1-5) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles or rituximab 375 mg/m2 in combination with CVP (R-CVP). \nRituximab was administered on the first day of each treatment cycle. A total of 321 patients (162 \nR-CVP, 159 CVP) received therapy and were analysed for efficacy. The median follow up of \npatients was 53 months. R-CVP led to a significant benefit over CVP for the primary endpoint, \ntime to treatment failure (27 months vs. 6.6 months, p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The proportion of \npatients with a tumour response (CR, CRu, PR) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001 Chi-Square \ntest) in the R-CVP group (80.9%) than the CVP group (57.2%). Treatment with R-CVP \nsignificantly prolonged the time to disease progression or death compared to CVP, 33.6 months \nand 14.7 months, respectively (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median duration of response was \n37.7 months in the R-CVP group and was 13.5 months in the CVP group (p < 0.0001, log-rank \ntest). \n \nThe difference between the treatment groups with respect to overall survival showed a significant \nclinical difference (p=0.029, log-rank test stratified by centre): survival rates at 53 months were \n80.9% for patients in the R-CVP group compared to 71.1% for patients in the CVP group．  \n \nResults from three other randomised trials using rituximab in combination with chemotherapy \nregimen other than CVP (CHOP, MCP, CHVP/Interferon-α) have also demonstrated significant \nimprovements in response rates, time-dependent parameters as well as in overall survival.

A total of 1078 patients \nresponded to induction therapy, of which 1018 were randomised to rituximab maintenance therapy \n(n=505) or observation (n=513). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regards to \nbaseline characteristics and disease status. Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single \ninfusion of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 2 months until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years. \n \nThe pre-specified primary analysis was conducted at a median observation time of 25 months \nfrom randomisation, maintenance therapy with rituximab resulted in a clinically relevant and \nstatistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of investigator assessed progression-\nfree survival (PFS) as compared to observation in patients with previously untreated follicular \nlymphoma (Table 7). \n \nSignificant benefit from maintenance treatment with rituximab was also seen for the secondary \nendpoints event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TNLT) time to next \nchemotherapy (TNCT) and overall response rate (ORR) in the primary analysis (Table 7).  \n \nData from extended follow-up of patients in the study (median follow-up 9 years) confirmed the long-\nterm benefit of rituximab maintenance therapy in terms of PFS, EFS, TNLT and TNCT (Table 7). \n \nTable 7 Overview of efficacy results for rituximab maintenance vs. observation at the \n\nprotocol-defined primary analysis and after 9 years median follow-up (final \nanalysis) \n\n Primary analysis \n(median FU: 25 months) \n\nFinal analysis \n(median FU: 9.0 years) \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nRituximab \nN=505 \n\nObservation \nN=513 \n\nRituximab \nN=505 \n\nPrimary efficacy     \nProgression-free survival (median) NR NR 4.06 years 10.49 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.50 (0.39, 0.64) \n50% \n\n0.61 (0.52, 0.73) \n39% \n\nSecondary efficacy     \nOverall survival (median) NR NR NR NR \nlog-rank p value 0.7246 0.7948 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction \n\n0.89 (0.45, 1.74) \n11% \n\n1.04 (0.77, 1.40) \n-6% \n\nEvent-free survival (median) 38 months NR 4.04 years 9.25 years \nlog-rank p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.54 (0.43, 0.69) \n46% \n\n0.64 (0.54, 0.76) \n36% \n\nTNLT (median) NR NR 6.11 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0003 <0.0001 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.61 (0.46, 0.80) \n39% \n\n0.66 (0.55, 0.78) \n34% \n\nTNCT (median) NR NR 9.32 years NR \nlog-rank p value 0.0011 0.0004 \nhazard ratio (95% CI) \nrisk reduction  \n\n0.60 (0.44, 0.82) \n40% \n\n0.71 (0.59, 0.86) \n39% \n\nOverall response rate* 55% 74% 61% 79% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \n\n\n\n74  \n\nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.33 (1.73, 3.15) 2.43 (1.84, 3.22) \nComplete response (CR/CRu) rate* 48% 67% 53% 67% \nchi-squared test p value <0.0001 <0.0001 \nodds ratio (95% CI) 2.21 (1.65, 2.94) 2.34 (1.80, 3.03)  \n* at end of maintenance/observation; final analysis results based on median follow-up of 73 months.  \nFU: follow-up; NR: not reached at time of clinical cut off, TNCT: time to next chemotherapy treatment; TNLT: time to next \nanti lymphoma treatment. \n \nRituximab maintenance treatment provided consistent benefit in all predefined subgroups tested: \ngender (male, female), age (< 60 years, ≥ 60 years), FLIPI score (≤1, 2 or ≥ 3), induction therapy (R-\nCHOP, R-CVP or R-FCM) and regardless of the quality of response to induction treatment (CR, \nCRu or PR). Exploratory analyses of the benefit of maintenance treatment showed a less pronounced \neffect in elderly patients (> 70 years of age), however sample sizes were small. \n \nRelapsed/Refractory follicular lymphoma \nIn a prospective, open label, international, multicentre, phase III trial, 465 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma were randomised in a first step to induction therapy with \neither CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone; n=231) or rituximab \nplus CHOP (R-CHOP, n=234). The two treatment groups were well balanced with regard to \nbaseline characteristics and disease status. A total of 334 patients achieving a complete or partial \nremission following induction therapy were randomised in a second step to rituximab maintenance \ntherapy (n=167) or observation (n=167). Rituximab maintenance treatment consisted of a single \ninfusion of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 body surface area given every 3 months until disease \nprogression or for a maximum period of two years. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all patients randomised to both parts of the study. After a \nmedian observation time of 31 months for patients randomised to the induction phase, R-CHOP \nsignificantly improved the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma when \ncompared to CHOP (see Table 8). \n \nTable 8 Induction phase: overview of efficacy results for CHOP vs. R-CHOP (31 \n\nmonths median observation time) \n CHOP R‐CHOP p‐value Risk reduction1) \nPrimary efficacy     \n\nORR2) 74% 87% 0.0003 NA \nCR2) 16% 29% 0.0005 NA \nPR2) 58% 58% 0.9449 NA \n\n1) Estimates were calculated by hazard ratios \n2) Last tumour response as assessed by the investigator.

Maintenance treatment with rituximab led to a clinically \nrelevant and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, PFS, (time from \nmaintenance randomisation to relapse, disease progression or death) when compared to observation \nalone (p< 0.0001 log-rank test).The median PFS was 42.2 months in the rituximab maintenance arm \ncompared to 14.3 months in the observation arm. Using a cox regression analysis, the risk of \nexperiencing progressive disease or death was reduced by 61% with rituximab maintenance \ntreatment when compared to observation (95% CI; 45%-72%). Kaplan-Meier estimated \nprogression-free rates at 12 months were 78% in the rituximab maintenance group vs. 57% in the \nobservation group. An analysis of overall survival confirmed the significant benefit of rituximab \nmaintenance over observation (p=0.0039 log-rank test). Rituximab maintenance treatment reduced \nthe risk of death by 56% (95% CI; 22%-75%). \n\n \nTable 9 Maintenance phase: overview of efficacy results rituximab vs. observation (28 \n\nmonths median observation time) \n\n\n\n75  \n\nEfficacy parameter \n\nKaplan-Meier estimate of \nmedian time to event (months) Risk \n\nreduction Observation \n(N = 167) \n\nRituximab \n(N=167) \n\nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression‐free survival \n(PFS) 14.3 42.2 < 0.0001 61% \n\nOverall survival NR NR 0.0039 56% \n\nTime to new lymphoma \ntreatment 20.1 38.8 < 0.0001 50% \n\n     \nDisease‐free survivala 16.5 53.7 0.0003 67% \n\nSubgroup analysis     \nPFS     \n\nCHOP 11.6 37.5 < 0.0001 71% \nR-CHOP 22.1 51.9 0.0071 46% \n\nCR 14.3 52.8 0.0008 64% \nPR 14.3 37.8 < 0.0001 54% \n\nOS     \nCHOP NR NR 0.0348 55% \n\nR-CHOP NR NR 0.0482 56% \nNR: not reached; a: only applicable to patients achieving a CR \n \nThe benefit of rituximab maintenance treatment was confirmed in all subgroups analysed, regardless \nof induction regimen (CHOP or R-CHOP) or quality of response to induction treatment (CR or PR) \n(Table 9). Rituximab maintenance treatment significantly prolonged median PFS in patients \nresponding to CHOP induction therapy (median PFS 37.5 months vs. 11.6 months, p< 0.0001) as \nwell as in those responding to R-CHOP induction (median PFS 51.9 months vs. 22.1 months, \np=0.0071). Although subgroups were small, rituximab maintenance treatment provided a significant \nbenefit in terms of overall survival for both patients responding to CHOP and patients responding to \nR-CHOP, although longer follow-up is required to confirm this observation. \n \nDiffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nIn a randomised, open-label trial, a total of 399 previously untreated elderly patients (age 60 to 80 \nyears) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma received standard CHOP chemotherapy \n(cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 2 \nmg on day 1, and prednisolone 40 mg/m2/day on days 1-5) every 3 weeks for eight cycles, or \nrituximab 375 mg/m2 plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Rituximab was administered on the first day of the \ntreatment cycle. \n \nThe final efficacy analysis included all randomised patients (197 CHOP, 202 R-CHOP), and had a \nmedian follow-up duration of approximately 31 months. The two treatment groups were well \nbalanced in baseline disease characteristics and disease status. The final analysis confirmed that R-\nCHOP treatment was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in \nthe duration of event-free survival (the primary efficacy parameter; where events were death, relapse \nor progression of lymphoma, or institution of a new anti-lymphoma treatment) (p=0.0001). Kaplan \nMeier estimates of the median duration of event-free survival were 35 months in the R-CHOP arm \ncompared to 13 months in the CHOP arm, representing a risk reduction of 41%. At 24 months, \nestimates for overall survival were 68.2% in the R-CHOP arm compared to 57.4% in the CHOP arm. \nA subsequent analysis of the duration of overall survival, carried out with a median follow-up \nduration of 60 months, confirmed the benefit of R-CHOP over CHOP treatment (p=0.0071), \nrepresenting a risk reduction of 32%. \n \nThe analysis of all secondary parameters (response rates, progression-free survival, disease-free \n\n\n\n76  \n\nsurvival, duration of response) verified the treatment effect of R-CHOP compared to CHOP. The \ncomplete response rate after cycle 8 was 76.2% in the R-CHOP group and 62.4% in the CHOP group \n(p=0.0028). The risk of disease progression was reduced by 46% and the risk of relapse by 51%. In all \npatients subgroups (gender, age, age adjusted IPI, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG, β2 microglobulin, LDH, \nalbumin, B symptoms, bulky disease, extranodal sites, bone marrow involvement), the risk ratios for \nevent-free survival and overall survival (R-CHOP compared with CHOP) were less than 0.83 and \n0.95 respectively. R-CHOP was associated with improvements in outcome for both high- and low-risk \npatients according to age adjusted IPI. \n \nClinical laboratory findings \n \nOf 67 patients evaluated for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), no responses were noted. Of \n356 patients evaluated for anti-drug antibody (ADA), 1.1% (4 patients) were positive. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nIn two open-label randomised trials, a total of 817 previously untreated patients and 552 patients \nwith relapsed/refractory CLL were randomised to receive either FC chemotherapy (fludarabine 25 \nmg/m2, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2, days 1-3) every 4 weeks for 6 cycles or rituximab in \ncombination with FC (R-FC). Rituximab was administered at a dosage of 375 mg/m2 during the first \ncycle one day prior to chemotherapy and at a dosage of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each subsequent \ntreatment cycle. Patients were excluded from the study in relapsed/refractory CLL if they had \npreviously been treated with monoclonal antibodies or if they were refractory (defined as failure to \nachieve a partial remission for at least 6 months) to fludarabine or any nucleoside analogue. A total \nof 810 patients (403 R-FC, 407 FC) for the first-line study (Table 10a and Table 10b) and 552 \npatients (276 R-FC, 276 FC) for the relapsed/refractory study (Table 11) were analysed for efficacy. \n \nIn the first-line study, after a median observation time of 48.1 months, the median PFS was 55 \nmonths in the R-FC group and 33 months in the FC group (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The analysis of \noverall survival showed a significant benefit of R-FC treatment over FC chemotherapy alone \n(p=0.0319, log-rank test) (Table 10a). The benefit in terms of PFS was consistently observed in most \npatient subgroups analysed according to disease risk at baseline (i.e. Binet stages A-C) (Table 10b). \n \nTable 10a First-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n Overview of efficacy results for rituximab plus FC vs. FC alone - 48.1 months \n\nmedian observation time \nEfficacy parameter Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time \n\nto event (months) \nRisk \n\nreduction \nFC \n\n(N = 409) \nR-FC \n\n(N=408) \nLog-rank \np value \n\nProgression‐free survival (PFS) 32.8 55.3 <0.0001 45% \nOverall survival NR NR 0.0319 27% \nEvent free survival 31.3 51.8 <0.0001 44% \nResponse rate (CR, nPR, or PR) \nCR rates \n\n72.6% \n16.9% \n\n85.8% \n36.0% \n\n<0.0001 \n<0.0001 \n\nN/A \nN/A \n\nDuration of response* 36.2 57.3 <0.0001 44% \nDisease free survival (DFS)** 48.9 60.3 0.0520 31% \nTime to new treatment 47.2 69.7 <0.0001 42% \n\nResponse rate and CR rates analysed using Chi-squared Test.

These studies support the use of rituximab with any chemotherapy. \n \nData in approximately 180 patients pre-treated with rituximab have demonstrated clinical \nbenefit (including CR) and are supportive for rituximab re-treatment. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with follicular lymphoma and chronic \nlymphocytic leukaemia. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in rheumatoid arthritis \n\n\n\n78  \n\n \nThe efficacy and safety of rituximab in alleviating the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis in \npatients with an inadequate response to TNF-inhibitors was demonstrated in a pivotal randomised, \ncontrolled, double-blind, multicentre trial (Trial 1). \n \nTrial 1 evaluated 517 patients that had experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to one or \nmore TNF inhibitor therapies. Eligible patients had active rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosed according \nto the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Rituximab was administered as two \nIV infusions separated by an interval of 15 days. Patients received 2 x 1000 mg intravenous infusions \nof rituximab or placebo in combination with MTX. All patients received concomitant 60 mg oral \nprednisone on days 2-7 and 30 mg on days 8-14 following the first infusion. The primary endpoint \nwas the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. Patients were followed \nbeyond week 24 for long-term endpoints, including radiographic assessment at 56 weeks and at 104 \nweeks. During this time, 81% of patients, from the original placebo group received rituximab \nbetween weeks 24 and 56, under an open label extension study protocol. \n \nStudies of rituximab in patients with early arthritis (patients without prior methotrexate treatment \nand patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, but not yet treated with TNF-alpha \ninhibitors) have met their primary endpoints. Rituximab is not indicated for these patients, since the \nsafety data about long-term rituximab treatment are insufficient, in particular concerning the risk of \ndevelopment of malignancies and PML. \n \nDisease activity outcomes \nRituximab in combination with methotrexate significantly increased the proportion of patients \nachieving at least a 20% improvement in ACR score compared with patients treated with \nmethotrexate alone (Table 12). Across all development studies the treatment benefit was similar in \npatients independent of age, gender, body surface area, race, number of prior treatments or disease \nstatus. \n \nClinically and statistically significant improvement was also noted on all individual components of \nthe ACR response (tender and swollen joint counts, patient and physician global assessment, \ndisability index scores (HAQ), pain assessment and C-Reactive Proteins (mg/dL). \n \nTable 12 Clinical response outcomes at primary endpoint in Trial 1 (ITT population) \n Outcome† Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX \n\n(2 x 1000 mg) \nTrial 1  N= 201 N= 298 \n\n ACR20 36 (18%) 153 (51%)*** \nACR50 11 (5%) 80 (27%)*** \nACR70 3 (1%) 37 (12%)*** \n\n EULAR Response \n(Good/Moderate) 44 (22%) 193 (65%)\n\n*** \n\n Mean change in DAS ‐0.34 ‐1.83*** \n† Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo + MTX at the primary time point: ***p ≤ 0.0001 \n \nPatients treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate had a significantly greater \nreduction in disease activity score (DAS28) than patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 12). \nSimilarly, in all studies a good to moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) \nresponse was achieved by significantly more rituximab treated patients treated with rituximab and \nmethotrexate compared to patients treated with methotrexate alone (Table 12). \n \nRadiographic response \nStructural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified \n\n\n\n79  \n\nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing \nscore. \n \nIn Trial 1, conducted in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF \ninhibitor therapies, receiving rituximab in combination with methotrexate demonstrated \nsignificantly less radiographic progression than patients originally receiving methotrexate alone at \n56 weeks. Of the patients originally receiving methotrexate alone, 81% received rituximab either as \nrescue between weeks 16-24 or in the extension trial, before week 56. A higher proportion of \npatients receiving the original rituximab/MTX treatment also had no erosive progression over 56 \nweeks (Table 13). \n \nTable 13 Radiographic outcomes at 1 year (mITT population) \n Placebo+MTX Rituximab +MTX \n\n2 × 1000 mg \n\nTrial 1 (n=184) (n=273) \nMean change from baseline:   \n\nModified total sharp score 2.30 1.01* \n\nErosion score 1.32 0.60* \n\nJoint space narrowing score 0.98 0.41** \n\nProportion of patients with no \nradiographic change \n\n46% 53%, NS \n\nProportion of patients with no erosive \nchange \n\n52% 60%, NS \n\n150 patients originally randomised to placebo + MTX in Trial 1 received at least one course of RTX + MTX by \none year \n* p <0.05, ** p < 0.001.

The proportions \nof rituximab treated patients showing a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in HAQ-DI \n(defined as an individual total score decrease of >0.22) was also higher than among patients receiving \nmethotrexate alone (Table 14). \n \nSignificant improvement in health related quality of life was also demonstrated with significant \nimprovement in both the physical health score (PHS) and mental health score (MHS) of the SF-36. \nFurther, significantly higher proportion of patients achieved MCIDs for these scores (Table 14). \n \nTable 14 Physical function and quality of life outcomes at week 24 in Trial 1 \n \n\nOutcome† Placebo+MTX Rituximab+MTX (2 x 1000 mg) \n \n \nMean change in HAQ‐DI \n\nn=201 \n \n\n0.1 \n\nn=298 \n \n\n‐0.4*** \n\n% HAQ‐DI MCID 20% 51% \n\n\n\n80  \n\nMean change in FACIT‐T ‐0.5 ‐9.1*** \n\n \n \nMean change in SF‐36 PHS \n\nn=197 \n \n\n0.9 \n\nn=294 \n \n\n5.8*** \n\n% SF‐36 PHS MCID 13% 48%*** \n\nMean change in SF‐36 MHS 1.3 4.7** \n\n% SF‐36 MHS MCID 20% 38%* \n† Outcome at 24 weeks \nSignificant difference from placebo at the primary time point: * p < 0.05, **p < 0.001 ***p ≤ 0.0001  \nMCID HAQ-DI ≥0.22, MCID SF-36 PHS >5.42, MCID SF-36 MHS >6.33 \n \nEfficacy in autoantibody (RF and or anti-CCP) seropositive patients \nPatients seropositive to Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and/or anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (anti-\nCCP) who were treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate showed an enhanced \nresponse compared to patients negative to both. \n \nEfficacy outcomes in rituximab treated patients were analysed based on autoantibody status prior \nto commencing treatment. At Week 24, patients who were seropositive to RF and/or anti-CCP at \nbaseline had a significantly increased probability of achieving ACR20 and 50 responses compared \nto seronegative patients (p=0.0312 and p=0.0096) (Table 15). These findings were replicated at \nWeek 48, where autoantibody seropositivity also significantly increased the probability of \nachieving ACR70. At week 48 seropositive patients were 2-3 times more likely to achieve ACR \nresponses compared to seronegative patients. Seropositive patients also had a significantly greater \ndecrease in DAS28-ESR compared to seronegative patients (Figure 1). \n \nTable 15 Summary of efficacy by baseline autoantibody status \n Week 24 Week 48 \n Seropositive \n\n(n=514) \nSeronegative \n\n(n=106) \nSeropositive \n\n(n=506) \nSeronegative \n\n(n=101) \nACR20 (%) 62.3* 50.9 71. 1* 51.5 \nACR50 (%) 32.7* 19.8 44.9** 22.8 \nACR70 (%) 12.1 5.7 20.9* 6.9 \nEULAR Response (%) 74.8* 62.9 84.3* 72.3 \nMean change DAS28-ESR ‐1.97** ‐1.50 ‐2.48*** ‐1.72 \n\nSignificance levels were defined as * p<0.05, **p<0.001, ***p<0.0001. \n \n\n\n\n81  \n\nFigure 1: Change from baseline of DAS28-ESR by baseline autoantibody status \n\n \n \nLong-term efficacy with multiple course therapy \nTreatment with rituximab in combination with methotrexate over multiple courses resulted in \nsustained improvements in the clinical signs and symptoms of RA, as indicated by ACR, DAS28-\nESR and EULAR responses which was evident in all patient populations studied (Figure 2). \nSustained improvement in physical function as indicated by the HAQ-DI score and the proportion of \npatients achieving MCID for HAQ-DI were observed. \n \nFigure 2: ACR responses for 4 treatment courses (24 weeks after each course (within \n\npatient, within visit) in patients with an inadequate response to \nTNF-inhibitors (n=146) \n\n \n \nClinical laboratory finding \n \nA total of 392/3095 (12.7%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis tested positive for ADA in clinical \nstudies following therapy with rituximab. The emergence of ADA was not associated with clinical \ndeterioration or with an increased risk of reactions to subsequent infusions in the majority of \npatients. The presence of ADA may be associated with worsening of infusion or allergic reactions \nafter the second infusion of subsequent courses. \n \n \n\n\n\n82  \n\nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nrituximab in all subsets of the paediatric population with autoimmune arthritis. See section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use. \n \nClinical experience in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nInduction of remission \n \nA total of 197 patients aged 15 years or older with severe active granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n(75%) and microscopic polyangiitis (24%) were enrolled and treated in an active-comparator, \nrandomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-inferiority trial. \n \nPatients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral cyclophosphamide daily (2 mg/kg/day) \nfor 3-6 months or rituximab (375 mg/m2) once weekly for 4 weeks. All patients in the \ncyclophosphamide arm received azathioprine maintenance therapy during follow-up. Patients in both \narms received 1000mg of pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (or another equivalent-dose \nglucocorticoid) per day for 1 to 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 \nmg/day). Prednisone tapering was to be completed by 6 months from the start of study treatment. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a \nBirmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) of 0, and off \nglucocorticoid therapy. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for the treatment difference was \n20%. The trial demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete \nremission (CR) at 6 months (Table 16). \n \nEfficacy was observed both for patients with newly diagnosed disease and for patients with relapsing \ndisease (Table 17). \n \nTable 16 Percentage of patients who achieved complete remission at 6 months \n\n(Intent-to-treat population*) \n \n\nRituximab \n(n = 99) \n\nCyclophosphamide \n(n = 98) \n\nTreatment difference \n(Rituximab \n\n--cyclophosphamide) \n\nRate 63.6% 53.1% \n10.6% \n\n95.1%b CI \n(−3.2%, 24.3%) a \n\n– CI = confidence interval. \n– * Worst case imputation \na Non-inferiority was demonstrated since the lower bound (−3.2%) was higher than the pre-determined  \n\nnon-inferiority margin (− 20%). \nb The 95.1% confidence level reflects an additional 0.001 alpha to account for an interim efficacy analysis. \n\n \nTable 17 Complete remission at 6-months by disease status \n Rituximab Cyclophosphamide Difference (CI 95%) \nAll patients \nNewly \ndiagnosed \n\n \n\nn=99 \nn=48 \nn=51 \n\nn=98 \nn=48 \nn=50 \n\n \n\nComplete remission \nAll Patients 63.6% 53.1% 10.6% (‐3.2, 24.3) \nNewly diagnosed 60.4% 64.6% − 4.2% (− 23.6, 15.3) \nRelapsing 66.7% 42.0% 24.7% (5.8, 43.6) \n\nWorst case imputation is applied for patients with missing data \n \n\n\n\n83  \n\nComplete remission at 12 and 18 months \nIn the rituximab group, 48% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 39% of patients achieved \nCR at 18 months. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine for \nmaintenance of complete remission), 39% of patients achieved CR at 12 months, and 33% of \npatients achieved CR at 18 months. From month 12 to month 18, 8 relapses were observed in the \nrituximab group compared with four in the cyclophosphamide group. \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 23/99 (23%) rituximab-treated patients from the induction of remission trial tested positive \nfor ADA by 18 months. None of the 99 rituximab-treated patients were ADA positive at screening. \nThere was no apparent negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy in the induction \nof remission trial. \n \nMaintenance treatment  \n \nA total of 117 patients (88 with GPA, 24 with MPA, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis) in disease remission were randomised to receive azathioprine (59 patients) or rituximab (58 \npatients) in a prospective, multi-center, controlled, open-label study. Included patients were 21 to 75 \nyears of age and had newly diagnosed or relapsing disease in complete remission after combined \ntreatment with glucocorticoids and pulse cyclophosphamide. The majority of patients were ANCA-\npositive at diagnosis or during the course of their disease; had histologically confirmed necrotizing \nsmall-vessel vasculitis with a clinical phenotype of GPA/MPA, or renal limited ANCA-associated \nvasculitis; or both. \n \nRemission-induction therapy included IV prednisone, administered as per the investigator’s discretion, \npreceded in some patients by methylprednisolone pulses, and pulse cyclophosphamide until remission \nwas attained after 4 to 6 months. At that time, and within a maximum of 1 month after the last \ncyclophosphamide pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab (two 500 mg IV \ninfusions separated by two weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15) followed by 500 mg IV every 6 months for \n18 months) or azathioprine (administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, then 1.5 \nmg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months (treatment discontinuation after these \n22 months). Prednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose (approximately 5 mg per \nday) for at least 18 months after randomisation. Prednisone dose tapering and the decision to stop \nprednisone treatment after month 18 were left at the investigator’s discretion.  \n \nAll patients were followed until month 28 (10 or 6 months, respectively, after the last rituximab \ninfusion or azathioprine dose). Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis was required for all \npatients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 250 per cubic millimeter. \n \nThe primary outcome measure was the rate of major relapse at month 28. \n \nResults \nAt month 28, major relapse (defined by the reappearance of clinical and/or laboratory signs of \nvasculitis activity ([BVAS] > 0) that could lead to organ failure or damage or could be life threatening) \noccurred in 3 patients (5%) in the rituximab group and 17 patients (29%) in the azathioprine group \n(p=0.0007). Minor relapses (not life threatening and not involving major organ damage) occurred in \nseven patients in the rituximab group (12%) and eight patients in the azathioprine group (14%).  \n \nThe cumulative incidence rate curves showed that time to first major relapse was longer in patients \nwith rituximab starting from month 2 and was maintained up to month 28 (Figure 3). \n\n \n\n\n\n84  \n\nFigure 3:  Cumulative incidence over time of first major relapse \n\n \n \n \n\nNumber of Subjects with Major Relapse \nAzathioprine 0 0 3 3 5 5 8 8 9 9 9 10 13 15 17 \nRituximab 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 \nNumber of subjects at risk \nAzathioprine 59 56 52 50 47 47 44 44 42 41 40 39 36 34 0 \nRituximab 58 56 56 56 55 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 52 50 0 \n\nNote: Patients were censored at month 28 if they had no event.    \n \nLaboratory evaluations \nA total of 6/34 (18%) of rituximab-treated patients from the maintenance therapy clinical trial \ndeveloped ADA. There was no apparent negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy \nin the maintenance therapy clinical trial.  \n \nClinical experience in pemphigus vulgaris \n \nThe efficacy and safety of rituximab in combination with short-term, low-dose glucocorticoid \n(prednisone) therapy were evaluated in newly diagnosed patients with moderate to severe pemphigus \n(74 pemphigus vulgaris [PV] and 16 pemphigus foliaceus [PF]) in this randomised, open-label, \ncontrolled, multicenter study. Patients were between 19 and 79 years of age and had not received prior \ntherapies for pemphigus. In the PV population, 5 (13%) patients in the rituximab group and 3 (8%) \npatients in the standard prednisone group had moderate disease and 33 (87%) patients in the rituximab \ngroup and 33 (92%) of patients in the standard-dose prednisone group had severe disease according to \ndisease severity defined by Harman’s criteria. \n \nPatients were stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate or severe) and randomised 1:1 to \nreceive either rituximab and low-dose prednisone or standard-dose prednisone. Patients randomised to \nthe rituximab group received an initial intravenous infusion of 1000 mg rituximab on Study Day 1 in \ncombination with 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 3 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 6 months if they had severe disease, and a \nsecond intravenous infusion of 1000 mg on Study Day 15. Maintenance infusions of rituximab 500 mg \nwere administered at months 12 and 18. Patients randomised to the standard-dose prednisone group \nreceived an initial 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 12 months if they had moderate \ndisease or 1.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisone tapered off over 18 months if they had severe disease.  \nPatients in the rituximab group who relapsed could receive an additional infusion of rituximab \n1000 mg in combination with reintroduced or escalated prednisone dose. Maintenance and relapse \ninfusions were administered no sooner than 16 weeks following the previous infusion.  \n \n\nSurvival Time (Months) \n\n\n\n85  \n\nThe primary objective for the study was complete remission (complete epithelialisation and absence of \nnew and/or established lesions) at month 24 without the use of prednisone therapy for two months or \nmore (CRoff for ≥ 2 months).  \n \nResults \nThe study showed statistically significant results of rituximab and low-dose prednisone over standard-\ndose prednisone in achieving CRoff ≥ 2 months at month 24 in PV patients (see Table 18).   \n\nTable 18 Percentage of PV patients who achieved complete remission off corticosteroid \ntherapy for two months or more at month 24 (Intent-to-Treat Population - PV) \n\n Rituximab + \nPrednisone \n\nN=38 \n\nPrednisone \nN=36 \n\np-value a 95% CIb \n\nNumber of responders      \n(response rate [%]) \n\n34 (89.5%) 10 (27.8%) <0.0001 61.7% (38.4, \n76.5) \n\na p-value is from Fisher’s exact test with mid-p correction \nb 95% confidence interval is corrected Newcombe interval   \n\n \n\n \n\nThe number of rituximab plus low-dose prednisone patients off prednisone therapy or on minimal \ntherapy (prednisone dose of 10 mg or less per day) compared to standard-dose prednisone patients \nover the 24-month treatment period shows a steroid-sparing effect of rituximab (Figure 4).  \n\nFigure 4:  Number of patients who were off or minimal corticosteroid (≤ 10mg/day) therapy \nover time \n\n \nPost-hoc retrospective laboratory evaluation \n\nA total of 19/34 (56%) patients with PV, who were treated with rituximab, tested positive for ADA \nantibodies by 18 months. The clinical relevance of ADA formation in rituximab-treated PV patients is \nunclear. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \n \nBased on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 298 NHL patients who received single or \nmultiple infusions of rituximab as a single agent or in combination with CHOP therapy (applied \nrituximab doses ranged from 100 to 500 mg/m2), the typical population estimates of nonspecific \nclearance (CL1), specific clearance (CL2) likely contributed by B cells or tumour burden, and \n\n\n\n86  \n\ncentral compartment volume of distribution (V1) were 0.14 L/day, 0.59 L/day, and 2.7 L, \nrespectively. The estimated median terminal elimination half-life of rituximab was 22 days (range, \n6.1 to 52 days). Baseline CD19-positive cell counts and size of measurable tumour lesions \ncontributed to some of the variability in CL2 of rituximab in data from 161 patients given 375 \nmg/m2 as an intravenous infusion for 4 weekly doses. Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts \nor tumour lesions had a higher CL2. However, a large component of inter-individual variability \nremained for CL2 after correction for CD19-positive cell counts and tumour lesion size. V1 varied \nby body surface area (BSA) and CHOP therapy. This variability in V1 (27.1% and 19.0%) \ncontributed by the range in BSA (1.53 to 2.32 m2) and concurrent CHOP therapy, respectively, were \nrelatively small. Age, gender and WHO performance status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \nrituximab. This analysis suggests that dose adjustment of rituximab with any of the tested covariates \nis not expected to result in a meaningful reduction in its pharmacokinetic variability. \n \nRituximab, administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at weekly intervals for 4 \ndoses to 203 patients with NHL naive to rituximab, yielded a mean Cmax following the fourth \ninfusion of 486 µg/mL (range, 77.5 to 996.6 µg/mL). Rituximab was detectable in the serum of \npatients 3 – 6 months after completion of last treatment. \n \nUpon administration of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at weekly \nintervals for 8 doses to 37 patients with NHL, the mean Cmax increased with each successive \ninfusion, spanning from a mean of 243 µg/mL (range, 16 – 582 µg/mL) after the first infusion to 550 \nµg/mL (range, 171 – 1177 µg/mL) after the eighth infusion. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in \ncombination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n \nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia \n \nRituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion at a first-cycle dose of 375 mg/m2 increased \nto 500 mg/m2 each cycle for 5 doses in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in CLL \npatients. The mean Cmax (N=15) was 408 µg/mL (range, 97 – 764 µg/mL) after the fifth 500 mg/ \nm2 infusion and the mean terminal half-life was 32 days (range, 14 – 62 days). \n \nRheumatoid arthritis \n \nFollowing two intravenous infusions of rituximab at a dose of 1000 mg, two weeks apart, the mean \nterminal half-life was 20.8 days (range, 8.58 to 35.9 days), mean systemic clearance was 0.23 L/day \n(range, 0.091 to 0.67 L/day), and mean steady-state distribution volume was 4.6 L (range, 1.7 to 7.51 \nL). Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the same data gave similar mean values for systemic \nclearance and half-life, 0.26 L/day and 20.4 days, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analysis \nrevealed that BSA and gender were the most significant covariates to explain inter-individual \nvariability in pharmacokinetic parameters. After adjusting for BSA, male subjects had a larger \nvolume of distribution and a faster clearance than female subjects. The gender-related \npharmacokinetic differences are not considered to be clinically relevant and dose adjustment is not \nrequired. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two intravenous (IV) doses of 500 mg \nand 1000 mg on Days 1 and 15 in four studies. In all these studies, rituximab pharmacokinetics were \ndose proportional over the limited dose range studied. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following \nfirst infusion ranged from 157 to 171 μg/mL for 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 298 to 341 μg/mL \nfor 2 × 1000 mg dose. Following second infusion, mean Cmax ranged from 183 to 198 μg/mL for \nthe 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 355 to 404 μg/mL for the 2 × 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal \nelimination half-life ranged from 15 to 16 days for the 2 × 500 mg dose group and 17 to 21 days for \nthe 2 × 1000 mg dose group. Mean Cmax was 16 to 19% higher following second infusion compared \nto the first infusion for both doses. \n \n\n\n\n87  \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of rituximab were assessed following two IV doses of 500 mg and 1000 mg \nupon re-treatment in the second course. Mean Cmax for serum rituximab following first infusion \nwas 170 to 175 μg/mL for 2 × 500 mg dose and 317 to 370 μg/mL for 2 × 1000 mg dose. Cmax \nfollowing second infusion, was 207 μg/mL for the 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 377 to 386 \nμg/mL for the 2 × 1000 mg dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life after the second infusion, \nfollowing the second course, was 19 days for 2 × 500 mg dose and ranged from 21 to 22 days for the \n2 × 1000 mg dose. PK parameters for rituximab were comparable over the two treatment courses. \n \nThe pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in the anti-TNF inadequate responder population, following the \nsame dosage regimen (2 × 1000 mg, IV, 2 weeks apart), were similar with a mean maximum serum \nconcentration of 369 μg/mL and a mean terminal half-life of 19.2 days. \n \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis \n \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in 97 patients with granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis who received 375 mg/m2 rituximab once weekly for four \ndoses, the estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 23 days (range, 9 to 49 days). \nRituximab mean clearance and volume of distribution were 0.313 L/day (range, 0.116 to 0.726 \nL/day) and 4.50 L (range 2.25 to 7.39 L) respectively. The PK parameters of rituximab in these \npatients appear similar to what has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nRituximab has shown to be highly specific to the CD20 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies in \ncynomolgus monkeys have shown no other effect than the expected pharmacological depletion \nof B cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissue. \n \nDevelopmental toxicity studies have been performed in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to \n100 mg/kg (treatment on gestation days 20-50) and have revealed no evidence of toxicity to the \nfoetus due to rituximab. However, dose-dependent pharmacologic depletion of B cells in the \nlymphoid organs of the foetuses was observed, which persisted post natally and was accompanied \nby a decrease in IgG level in the newborn animals affected. B cell counts returned to normal in these \nanimals within 6 months of birth and did not compromise the reaction to immunisation. \n \nStandard tests to investigate mutagenicity have not been carried out, since such tests are not relevant \nfor this molecule. No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic \npotential of rituximab.  \n\n \nSpecific studies to determine the effects of rituximab on fertility have not been performed. In general \ntoxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys no deleterious effects on reproductive organs in males or \nfemales were observed. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n  \n\n\n\n105  \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nRitemvia 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \nrituximab \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Ritemvia is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Ritemvia \n3. How to use Ritemvia \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ritemvia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n1. What Ritemvia is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat Ritemvia is \nRitemvia contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \n \nWhat Ritemvia is used for \nRitemvia may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may \nprescribe Ritemvia for the treatment of: \n \na) Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell \ncalled B-Lymphocytes. \nRitemvia can be given alone or with other medicines called “chemotherapy”. \nIn patients where the treatment is working, Ritemvia may be continued for 2 years after completing \nthe initial treatment. \n \nb) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nRitemvia is used for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the \nblood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. \nB-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n \nc) Pemphigus vulgaris \nRitemvia is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. \nPemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of \nthe mouth, nose, throat and genitals. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n106  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ritemvia  \n \nDo not take Ritemvia if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment \n• you have a weak immune system \n• you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with \n\npolyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. \n \nDo not have Ritemvia if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given Ritemvia. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ritemvia if: \n \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nRitemvia could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection. \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Ritemvia. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \nRitemvia. \n \nIf you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris \nalso tell your doctor \n• if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby Ritemvia help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you \nare given Ritemvia. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or \nsuffer from severe infections. \n\n• if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to  \ntravel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Ritemvia or in \nthe months after you receive Ritemvia. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \nbefore you receive Ritemvia. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, \nare under 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of Ritemvia \nin children and young people. \n \nOther medicines and Ritemvia \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Ritemvia can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way Ritemvia works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given Ritemvia. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given Ritemvia. \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \n\n\n\n107  \n\nyou are given Ritemvia. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because Ritemvia can across the placenta and may affect \nyour baby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception \nwhile using Ritemvia. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with \nRitemvia. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with Ritemvia. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with Ritemvia. This is because Ritemvia may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether Ritemvia has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \nRitemvia contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 52.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 10 mL vial. \nThis is equivalent to 2.6% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an \nadult. \n \n3. How Ritemvia is given  \n \nHow it is given \nRitemvia will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any \nside effects. \nYou will always be given Ritemvia as a drip (intravenous infusion). \n \nMedicines given before each Ritemvia administration \nBefore you are given Ritemvia, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \na) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \n• If you are having Ritemvia alone \n\nRitemvia will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with \nRitemvia are possible. \n\n• If you are having Ritemvia with chemotherapy \nRitemvia will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n\n• If you respond well to treatment, you may be given Ritemvia every 2 or 3 months for two \nyears. Your doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n\n \nb) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis  \nTreatment with Ritemvia uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will \nusually be given by injection before the start of Ritemvia treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth \nmay be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. If you respond well to treatment, \nyou may be given Ritemvia as a maintenance treatment. This will be administered as 2 separate \ninfusions which are given 2 weeks apart, followed by 1 infusion every 6 months for at least 2 years. \nYour doctor may decide to treat you longer with Ritemvia (up to 5 years), depending on how you \nrespond to the medicine. \n \nc) If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris \nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you \nrespond well to treatment, you may be given Ritemvia as a maintenance treatment. This will be \n\n\n\n108  \n\nadministered 1 year and 18 months after the initial treatment and then every 6 months as needed or \nyour doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese reactions have been fatal. \n \nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less \nfrequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness \n(nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat \ndiscomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart \nattack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get \nworse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of these \nsymptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional \ntreatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the \ninfusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion.

What you need to know before you use Ritemvia \n3. How to use Ritemvia \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ritemvia \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n1. What Ritemvia is and what it is used for  \n \nWhat Ritemvia is \nRitemvia contains the active substance “rituximab”. This is a type of protein called a “monoclonal \nantibody”. It sticks to the surface of a type of white blood cell called “B-Lymphocyte”. When \nrituximab sticks to the surface of this cell, the cell dies. \n \nWhat Ritemvia is used for \nRitemvia may be used for the treatment of several different conditions in adults. Your doctor may \nprescribe Ritemvia for the treatment of: \n \na) Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \nThis is a disease of the lymph tissue (part of the immune system) that affects a type of white blood cell \ncalled B-Lymphocytes. \nRitemvia can be given alone or with other medicines called “chemotherapy”. \nIn patients where the treatment is working, Ritemvia may be continued for 2 years after completing \nthe initial treatment. \n \nb) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis \nRitemvia is used for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener’s \ngranulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, taken in combination with corticosteroids. \nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis are two forms of inflammation of the \nblood vessels which mainly affects the lungs and kidneys, but may affect other organs as well. \nB-lymphocytes are involved in the cause of these conditions. \n\n \nc) Pemphigus vulgaris \nRitemvia is used for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. \nPemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune condition that causes painful blisters on the skin and lining of \nthe mouth, nose, throat and genitals. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n115  \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Ritemvia  \n \nDo not take Ritemvia if: \n• you are allergic to rituximab, other proteins which are like rituximab, or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) \n• you have a severe active infection at the moment \n• you have a weak immune system \n• you have severe heart failure or severe uncontrolled heart disease and have granulomatosis with \n\npolyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris. \n \nDo not have Ritemvia if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before you are given Ritemvia. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ritemvia if: \n \n• you have ever had or might now have a hepatitis infection. This is because in a few cases, \n\nRitemvia could cause hepatitis B to become active again, which can be fatal in very rare cases. \nPatients who have ever had hepatitis B infection will be carefully checked by their doctor for \nsigns of this infection. \n\n• you have ever had heart problems (such as angina, palpitations or heart failure) or breathing \nproblems. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nyou are given Ritemvia. Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with \nRitemvia. \n \nIf you have granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus vulgaris \nalso tell your doctor \n• if you think you may have an infection, even a mild one like a cold. The cells that are affected \n\nby Ritemvia help to fight infection and you should wait until the infection has passed before you \nare given Ritemvia. Also please tell your doctor if you had a lot of infections in the past or \nsuffer from severe infections. \n\n• if you think you may need any vaccinations in the near future, including vaccinations needed to  \ntravel to other countries. Some vaccines should not be given at the same time as Ritemvia or in \nthe months after you receive Ritemvia. Your doctor will check if you should have any vaccines \nbefore you receive Ritemvia. \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, \nare under 18 years of age. This is because there is not much information about the use of Ritemvia \nin children and young people. \n \nOther medicines and Ritemvia \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. This is \nbecause Ritemvia can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can \naffect the way Ritemvia works. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor: \n• if you are taking medicines for high blood pressure. You may be asked not to take these other \n\nmedicines 12 hours before you are given Ritemvia. This is because some people have a fall in \ntheir blood pressure while they are being given Ritemvia. \n\n• if you have ever taken medicines which affect your immune system – such as chemotherapy or \nimmune-suppressive medicines. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \n\n\n\n116  \n\nyou are given Ritemvia. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must tell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are \nplanning to become pregnant. This is because Ritemvia can across the placenta and may affect \nyour baby. \nIf you can get pregnant, you and your partner must use an effective method of contraception \nwhile using Ritemvia. You must also do this for 12 months after your last treatment with \nRitemvia. \nDo not breast-feed while you are being treated with Ritemvia. Also do not breast-feed for 12 months \nafter your last treatment with Ritemvia. This is because Ritemvia may pass into breast milk. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is not known whether Ritemvia has an effect on you being able to drive or use any tools or \nmachines. \n \nRitemvia contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 263.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 50 mL \nvial. This is equivalent to 13.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for \nan adult. \n \n3. How Ritemvia is given  \n \nHow it is given \nRitemvia will be given to you by a doctor or nurse who is experienced in the use of this treatment. \nThey will watch you closely while you are being given this medicine. This is in case you get any \nside effects. \n \nYou will always be given Ritemvia as a drip (intravenous infusion). \n \nMedicines given before each Ritemvia administration \nBefore you are given Ritemvia, you will be given other medicines (pre-medication) to prevent or \nreduce possible side effects. \n \nHow much and how often you will receive your treatment \n \na) If you are being treated for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma \n• If you are having Ritemvia alone \n\nRitemvia will be given to you once a week for 4 weeks. Repeated treatment courses with \nRitemvia are possible. \n\n• If you are having Ritemvia with chemotherapy \nRitemvia will be given to you on the same day as your chemotherapy. This is usually given \nevery 3 weeks up to 8 times. \n\n• If you respond well to treatment, you may be given Ritemvia every 2 or 3 months for two \nyears. Your doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n\n \nb) If you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis  \nTreatment with Ritemvia uses four separate infusions given at weekly intervals. Corticosteroids will \nusually be given by injection before the start of Ritemvia treatment. Corticosteroids given by mouth \nmay be started at any time by your doctor to treat your condition. \nIf you respond well to treatment, you may be given Ritemvia as a maintenance treatment. This will \nbe administered as 2 separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart, followed by 1 infusion every \n6 months for at least 2 years. Your doctor may decide to treat you longer with Ritemvia (up to 5 \nyears), depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \nc) If you are being treated for pemphigus vulgaris \nEach course of treatment is made up of two separate infusions which are given 2 weeks apart. If you \n\n\n\n117  \n\nrespond well to treatment, you may be given Ritemvia as a maintenance treatment. This will be \nadministered 1 year and 18 months after the initial treatment and then every 6 months as needed or \nyour doctor may change this, depending on how you respond to the medicine. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost side effects are mild to moderate but some may be serious and require treatment. Rarely, some of \nthese reactions have been fatal. \n \nInfusion reactions \nDuring or within the first 24 hours of the infusion you may develop fever, chills and shivering. Less \nfrequently, some patients may experience pain at the infusion site, blisters, itching, sickness \n(nausea), tiredness, headache, breathing difficulties, blood pressure raised, wheezing, throat \ndiscomfort, tongue or throat swelling, itchy or runny nose, vomiting, flushing or palpitations, heart \nattack or low number of platelets. If you have heart disease or angina, these reactions might get \nworse. Tell the person giving you the infusion immediately if you develop any of these \nsymptoms, as the infusion may need to be slowed down or stopped. You may require additional \ntreatment such as an antihistamine or paracetamol. When these symptoms go away, or improve, the \ninfusion can be continued. These reactions are less likely to happen after the second infusion. Your \ndoctor may decide to stop your Ritemvia treatment if these reactions are serious. \n \nInfections \nTell your doctor immediately if you get signs of an infection including: \n \n• fever, cough, sore throat, burning pain when passing urine or feeling weak or generally unwell \n• memory loss, trouble thinking, difficulty walking or sight loss – these may be due to a very rare, \n\nserious brain infection, which has been fatal (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or \nPML). \n\nYou might get infections more easily during your treatment with Ritemvia. \nThese are often colds, but there have been cases of pneumonia or urinary infections. These are \nlisted below under “Other side effects”. \n \nIf you are being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis or pemphigus \nvulgaris, you will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card you have been given by your \ndoctor. It is important that you keep this Alert Card and show it to your partner or caregiver. \n \nSkin reactions \nVery rarely, severe blistering skin conditions that can be life-threatening may occur.
