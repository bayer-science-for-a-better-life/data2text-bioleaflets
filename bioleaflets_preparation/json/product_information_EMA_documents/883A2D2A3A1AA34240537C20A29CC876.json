This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNaglazyme 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach ml of solution contains 1 mg galsulfase. One vial of 5 ml contains 5 mg galsulfase. \n \nGalsulfase is a recombinant form of human N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase and is produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology using mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture. \n \nExcipients \n \nEach 5 ml vial contains 0.8 mmol (18.4 mg) of sodium. \n \nFor a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion. \nA clear to slightly opalescent, and colourless to pale yellow solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNaglazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed \ndiagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI; N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase deficiency; \nMaroteaux-Lamy syndrome) (see section 5.1). \n \nA key issue is to treat children aged <5 years suffering from a severe form of the disease, even though \nchildren <5 years were not included in the pivotal phase 3 study. Limited data are available in patients \n< 1 year of age (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nAs for all lysosomal genetic disorders, it is of primary importance, especially in severe forms, to \ninitiate treatment as early as possible, before appearance of non-reversible clinical manifestations of \nthe disease. \n \nNaglazyme treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients \nwith MPS VI or other inherited metabolic diseases. Administration of Naglazyme should be carried \nout in an appropriate clinical setting where resuscitation equipment to manage medical emergencies \nwould be readily available. \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dose regimen for galsulfase is 1 mg/kg body weight administered once every week \nas an intravenous infusion over 4 hours.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe safety and efficacy of Naglazyme in patients older than 65 years has not been established, and no \nalternative dose regimen can be recommended in these patients. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nThe safety and efficacy of Naglazyme in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency have not been \nevaluated (see section 5.2) and no alternative dose regimen can be recommended in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no evidence for special considerations when Naglazyme is administered to the paediatric \npopulation. Currently available data are described in section 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nThe initial infusion rate is adjusted so that approximately 2.5% of the total solution is infused during \nthe first hour, with infusion of the remaining volume (approximately 97.5%) over the next 3 hours.  \n \n100 ml infusion bags should be considered for patients who are susceptible to fluid volume overload \nand weigh less than 20 kg; in this case the infusion rate (ml/min) should be decreased so that the total \nduration remains no less than 4 hours.  \n \nFor information on pre-treatment see section 4.4 and for further instructions see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nSevere or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, if \nhypersensitivity is not controllable. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nManagement of compromised airways \n \nCaution must be exercised in the management and treatment of patients with compromised airways by \nlimitation or careful monitoring of antihistamine and other sedative medicinal product use. Institution \nof positive–airway pressure during sleep as well as potential tracheostomy in clinically appropriate \nsituations should also be considered. \n \nPatients who present with an acute febrile or respiratory illness may need to have their Naglazyme \ninfusions delayed. \n \nManagement of infusion-associated reactions \n \nPatients treated with Naglazyme have developed infusion-associated reactions (IARs), defined as any \nadverse reactions occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8). \n \nBased on data obtained during Naglazyme clinical trials, the majority of patients are expected to \ndevelop IgG antibodies to galsulfase within 4-8 weeks of treatment initiation.  \n \nIn the Naglazyme clinical trials, IARs were usually manageable by interrupting or slowing the rate of \ninfusion and by (pre-) treating the patient with antihistamines and/or antipyretics (paracetamol), thus \nenabling the patient to continue treatment. \n \nAs there is little experience on resumption of treatment following prolonged interruption, caution is to \nbe used due to the theoretical increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nWith administration of Naglazyme it is recommended that patients be administered pre-treatment \nmedicinal products (antihistamines with or without antipyretics) approximately 30-60 minutes prior to \nthe start of the infusion, to minimise the potential occurrence of IARs. \n \nIn case of a mild or moderate IAR, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol should be \nconsidered and/or a reduction in the infusion rate to half the rate at which the reaction occurred. \n \nIn case of a single severe IAR, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are resolved and \ntreatment with antihistamines and paracetamol should be considered. The infusion can be restarted \nwith a reduction of the infusion rate to 50% – 25% of the rate at which the reaction occurred. \n \nIn case of a recurrent moderate IAR or re-challenge after a single severe IAR, pre-treatment should be \nconsidered (antihistamines and paracetamol and/or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate \nto 50% – 25% of the rate at which the previous reaction occurred. \n \nAs with any intravenous protein medicinal product, severe allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are \npossible. If these reactions occur, immediate discontinuation of Naglazyme is recommended and \nappropriate medical treatment should be initiated. The current medical standards for emergency \ntreatment are to be observed. In patients who have experienced allergic reactions during infusion with \nNaglazyme, caution should be exercised upon rechallenge; appropriately trained personnel and \nequipment for emergency resuscitation (including epinephrine) should be available during infusions. \nSevere, or potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity is a contraindication to rechallenge, if \nhypersensitivity is not controllable. See also section 4.3. \n \n\nSpinal or cervical cord compression \n\nSpinal/cervical cord compression (SCC) with resultant myelopathy is a known and serious \ncomplication that can be due to MPS VI. There have been post-marketing reports of patients treated \nwith Naglazyme who experienced the onset or worsening of SCC requiring decompression surgery.  \nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal/cervical cord compression (including \nback pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, urinary and faecal incontinence) and \ngiven appropriate clinical care. \n \nRisk of Acute Cardio-respiratory Failure  \n \nCaution should be exercised when administering Naglazyme to patients susceptible to fluid volume \noverload; such as in patients weighing 20 kg or less, patients with acute underlying respiratory illness, \nor patients with compromised cardiac and/or respiratory function, because congestive heart failure \nmay occur.  Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available during \nNaglazyme infusion, and some patients may require prolonged observation times that should be based \non the individual needs of the patient (see section 4.2). \n \nImmune-mediated Reactions \n \nType III immune complex-mediated reactions including membranous glomerulonephritis have been \nobserved with Naglazyme. If immune-mediated reactions occur, discontinuation of the administration \nof Naglazyme should be considered, and appropriate medical treatment initiated.  The risks and \nbenefits of re-administering Naglazyme following an immune-mediated reaction should be considered \n(see section 4.2).   \n \nSodium restricted diet  \n \nThis medicinal product contains 0.8 mmol (18.4 mg) sodium per vial and is administered in sodium \nchloride 9 mg/ml solution for injection (see section 6.6). To be taken into consideration by patients on \na controlled sodium diet. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nFor Naglazyme, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy or embryo-foetal development (see \nsection 5.3). Naglazyme should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether galsulfase is excreted in milk, therefore breast-feeding should be stopped \nduring Naglazyme treatment.  \n \nFertility \nReproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3 mg/kg/day and have \nrevealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the embryo or foetus due to Naglazyme. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nDue to the low number of patients in clinical trials, adverse event (AE) data from all Naglazyme \nstudies have been pooled and reviewed in a single, clinical trial safety analysis. \n \nAll patients treated with NAGLAZYME (59/59) reported at least one AE. The majority (42/59; 71%) \nof patients experienced at least one Adverse Drug Reaction. The most common adverse reactions were \npyrexia, rash, pruritus, urticaria, chills/rigors, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting and \ndypsnoea. Serious adverse reactions included laryngeal edema, apnoea, pyrexia, urticaria, respiratory \ndistress, angioedema, asthma and anaphylactoid reaction. \n \nInfusion reactions, defined as adverse reactions occurring during Naglazyme infusions or until the end \nof the infusion day, were observed in 33 (56%) of the 59 patients treated with Naglazyme across five \nclinical studies. Infusion reactions began as early as Week 1 and as late as Week 146 of Naglazyme \ntreatment, and occurred during multiple infusions though not always in consecutive weeks. Very \ncommon symptoms of these infusion reactions were pyrexia, chills/rigors, rash, urticaria and \ndyspnoea. Common symptoms of infusion reactions were pruritus, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, \nhypertension, headache, chest pain, erythema, cough, hypotension, angioedema, respiratory distress, \ntremor, conjunctivitis, malaise, bronchospasm and arthralgia. \n \nAdverse reactions are listed in Table 1 by System Organ Class. \n \nThe reactions are listed following the MedDRA frequency convention. Very common adverse \nreactions are those with a frequency of 1/10. Common reactions have a frequency of 1/100 to \n<1/10. Due to the small patient population, an adverse reaction in a single patient is classified as \ncommon.  \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nAdverse reactions reported during the Post Marketing period are included at a frequency category of \n“unknown”.  \n \nOverall, one case of sleep apnoea was experienced from all clinical studies. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nTable 1: Frequency of adverse drug reactions with Naglazyme \n \n\nMedDRA \nSystem Organ Class \n\nMedDRA \nPreferred Term\n\nFrequency \n\nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis, shock Unknown \n\nInfections and infestations Pharyngitis1, gastroenteritis1 Very common \n\nNervous system disorders Areflexia1, headache Very common\nTremor Common \n\nParesthesia Unknown \nEye disorders Conjunctivitis1, corneal opacity1 Very common\n\nCardiac disorders Bradycardia, tachycardia, cyanosis Unknown \nEar and labyrinth disorders Ear pain1, hearing impaired1 Very common\n\nVascular disorders Hypertension1 Very common\nHypotension Common \n\nPallor Unknown \nRespiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal\n\ndisorders \nDyspnoea1, nasal congestion1 Very common \n\nApnoea1, cough, respiratory distress, \nasthma, bronchospasm\n\nCommon \n\nLaryngeal oedema, hypoxia, \ntachypnoea\n\nUnknown \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain1, umbilical hernia1, \nvomiting, nausea\n\nVery common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nAngioeodema1, rash1, urticaria, pruritus Very Common\nErythema Common \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nPain1, chest pain1, rigors1, malaise1, \npyrexia \n\nVery Common \n\nMusculoskeletal and Connective \nTissue Disorders \n\nArthralgia Very common \n\n \n1Reactions reported more frequently in the active arm of the placebo-controlled study than the placebo \narm; frequency determined from 39 patients of the blinded Phase 3 study. \nOther reactions with known frequency were reported from 59 patients treated with Naglazyme from all \nfive clinical trials. \n \nReactions of unknown frequency were reported post-marketing. \n \nIn four patients <1 year of age, the overall safety profile of a higher dose (2 mg/kg/week) did not differ \nin a clinically meaningful manner from that of the recommended 1 mg/kg/week dose, and was \nconsistent with the safety profile of Naglazyme in older children. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nOut of the 59 patients treated with Naglazyme in the clinical studies, 54 were tested for IgG \nantibodies. 53/54 patients (98%) were positive for IgG antibodies to galsulfase.  \n \nA comprehensive antibody analysis based on data from three clinical studies has been carried out in \n48 patients. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nAlthough a larger proportion of subjects with high total antibody titres experienced recurrent infusion \nreactions, neither frequency nor severity could be predicted based on the anti-galsulfase antibody titre. \nLikewise, antibody development is not predictive of decreased efficacy although subjects with limited \nresponse in endurance parameters or urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) tended to have higher peak \nanti-galsulfase titres than those with good response. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions   \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSeveral patients have received their total dose of Naglazyme at approximately twice the recommended \ninfusion rate without apparent adverse events. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, enzymes, ATC code: \nA16AB08 \n \nMucopolysaccharide storage disorders are caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes \nrequired for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). MPS VI is a heterogeneous and \nmultisystemic disorder characterized by the deficiency of N-acetylgalactoasamine 4-sulfatase, a \nlysosomal hydrolase which catalyses the hydrolysis of sulfate moiety of the glycosaminoglycan, \ndermatan sulfate. Reduced or absent N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase activity results in the \naccumulation of dermatan sulfate in many cell types and tissues. \n \nThe rationale for enzyme replacement therapy is to restore a level of enzymatic activity sufficient to \nhydrolyze the accumulated substrate and to prevent further accumulation.  \n \nPurified galsulfase, a recombinant form of human N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, is a glycoprotein \nwith a molecular weight of approximately 56 kD. Galsulfase is comprised of 495 amino acids after \ncleavage of the N-terminus. The molecule contains 6 N-linked oligosaccharide modification sites. \nAfter intravenous infusion, galsulfase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells \ninto lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors. \n \nThe three clinical studies performed with Naglazyme focused on assessing the systemic manifestations \nof MPS VI such as endurance, joint mobility, joint pain and stiffness, upper airway obstruction, \nmanual dexterity and visual acuity.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Naglazyme was assessed in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, \nPhase 3 study of 39 MPS VI patients, ranging in age from 5 to 29 years. The majority of the patients \npresented with short stature, impaired endurance, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who could \nwalk more than 5 meters (m) but less than 250 m in 6 minutes of a 12 Minute Walk test or less than \n400 m at the 12 minute time point at baseline were enrolled in the study. \n \nPatients received either 1 mg/kg of galsulfase or placebo every week for a total of 24 weeks. The \nprimary efficacy endpoint was the numbers of meters walked in 12 minutes at Week 24 compared to \nthe number of meters walked at baseline. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the rate of stairs \nclimbed in three minutes and the urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion of treated patients compared to \n\n\n\n8 \n\nplacebo at Week 24. Thirty-eight patients subsequently enrolled in an Open Label extension study \nwhere they received 1 mg/kg of galsulfase every week. \n \nFollowing 24 weeks of therapy, Naglazyme-treated patients experienced a 92 ± 40 m improvement in \nthe distance walked in 12 minutes relative to placebo-treated patients (p = 0.025). Treated patients \nexperienced a 5.7 stair per minute improvement in the 3 Minute Stair Climb relative to placebo-treated \npatients. Treated patients also experienced a mean decrease in urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion of \n238 ± 17.8 μg/mg creatinine ( Standard Error [SE]) following 24 weeks of treatment relative to \nplacebo-treated patients. GAG results approached the normal range for age in the Naglazyme \ntreatment group. \n \nIn an additional Phase 4, randomised, two-dose level study, four MPS VI patients <1 year of age were \ntreated at 1 or 2 mg/kg/week for 53 to 153 weeks. \n \nAlthough limited by the very small number of patients that were enrolled, the conclusions that can be \ndrawn from this study are the following: \n \nTreatment with Naglazyme showed improvement, or lack of worsening, of facial dysmorphism. It did \nnot prevent the progression of skeletal dysplasia and development of hernias and did not prevent the \nprogression of corneal clouding. Growth rate remained normal over this limited follow-up period. \nImproved hearing was noted in at least one ear for all four subjects. Urinary GAG levels decreased by \nmore than 70%, consistent with results in older patients. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under \"Exceptional Circumstances\". \nThis means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information \non this medicinal product. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of galsulfase were evaluated in 13 patients with MPS VI who received 1 mg/kg \nof galsulfase as a 4 hour infusion. After 24 weeks of treatment the mean ( Standard Deviation [SD]) \nmaximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 2,357 (± 1,560) ng/ml and the mean ( SD) area under the \nplasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) was 5,860 ( 4,184) h  ng/ml. The mean ( SD) volume of \ndistribution (Vz) was 316 ( 752) ml/kg and the mean ( SD) plasma clearance (CL) was \n7.9 ( 14.7) ml/min/kg. The mean ( SD) elimination half-life (t1/2) was 22.8 ( 10.7) minutes at \nWeek 24. \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters in Phase 1 patients have remained stable over the long term (through at \nleast 194 weeks). \n \nGalsulfase is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis. \nConsequently, impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of galsulfase in a \nclinically significant way. Renal elimination of galsulfase is considered a minor pathway for clearance \n(see section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single-dose toxicity, repeated-dose toxicity or on general reproductive performance or \nembryo-foetal development in rats or rabbits. Peri- and post-natal toxicity has not been investigated. \nGenotoxic and carcinogenic potential are not expected. \n \nThe cause of clinical relevance of the hepatic toxicity (bile duct hyperplasia / periportal inflammation) \nseen at clinically relevant doses in the repeated dose monkey toxicity study is not known. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new safety \ninformation. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how \nto report side effects.  \n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, \n\nplease tell your doctor. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What this medicine is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given this medicine  \n3. How this medicine is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store this medicine \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What this medicine is and what it is used for \n \nNaglazyme is used to treat patients with MPS VI disease (Mucopolysaccharidosis VI).  \n \nPeople with MPS VI disease have either a low level, or no level, of an enzyme called \nN-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase, which breaks down specific substances (glycosaminoglycans) in \nthe body. As a result, these substances do not get broken down and processed by the body as they \nshould. They accumulate in many tissues in the body, which causes the symptoms of MPS VI. \n \nHow this medicine works \n \nThis medicine contains a recombinant enzyme called galsulfase. This can replace the natural enzyme \nwhich is lacking in MPS VI patients.  Treatment has been shown to improve walking and stair-\nclimbing ability, and to reduce the levels of glycosaminoglycans in the body.  This medicine may \nimprove the symptoms of MPS VI. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given this medicine  \n \nYou must not receive this medicine \n- If you have experienced severe or life-threatening allergic (hypersensitive) reactions to \n\ngalsulfase or any of the other ingredients of Naglazyme and re-administration of the medicine \nwas not successful. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \n- If you are treated with Naglazyme, you may develop infusion-associated reactions. An infusion \n\nassociated reaction is any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end of the \ninfusion day (see section 4 “Possible Side Effects”). When you experience such a reaction, you \nshould immediately contact your doctor. \n\n\n\n23 \n\n-  If you have an allergic reaction your doctor may slow down, or stop, your infusion.  Your doctor \nmay also give you additional medicines to manage any allergic reactions. \n\n- If you have a fever, or if you are having difficulty breathing before this medicine is given, talk \nwith your doctor about delaying your Naglazyme infusion. \n\n- If you have an underlying heart condition, please inform your doctor at any point while being \ntreated with Naglazyme. They may adjust your infusion based on this information. \n\n-  This medicine has not been tested in patients with kidney or liver problems. Talk to your doctor \nif you have kidney or liver insufficiency. \n\n- Please talk to your doctor if you experience muscle pain, numbness in your arms or legs, or any \nbowel or bladder problems as these may be caused by pressure on your spinal cord. \n\n \nOther medicines and Naglazyme \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nNaglazyme should not be given during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.  It is not known whether galsulfase is excreted in \nmilk, therefore breast-feeding should be stopped during Naglazyme treatment. Ask your doctor or \npharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. \n \nThis medicine contains Sodium \nEach 5 ml vial contains 0.8 mmol (18.4 mg) of sodium and is administered in sodium chloride 9 \nmg/ml solution for injection. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How this medicine is given \n \nYour doctor or nurse will administer Naglazyme to you. \nThe dose you receive is based on your body weight.  The recommended dose is 1 mg/kg body weight \nadministered once every week through a drip into a vein (by intravenous infusion). Each infusion will \ntake approximately 4 hours. For the first hour the infusion rate will be slow (approximately 2.5% of \nthe total solution), with the remaining volume (approximately 97.5%) being taken over the next 3 \nhours. \n \nIf you are given more Naglazyme than you should \nNaglazyme is administered under the supervision of a nurse or doctor, he or she will check that the \ncorrect dose has been given and act accordingly if necessary. \n \nIf you forget to take this medicine \nIf you have missed a Naglazyme infusion, please contact your doctor.  If you have any further \nquestions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects were mainly seen while patients were being given the medicine or shortly after (“infusion \nassociated reactions”). The most serious side effects were swollen face and fever (very common); \nlonger than normal gaps between breaths, difficulty breathing, asthma and hives (common); and \nswelling of the tongue and throat, and serious allergic reaction to this medicine (unknown frequency). \n\n\n\n24 \n\nIf you experience any reaction like this, please tell your doctor immediately. You may need to be \ngiven additional medicines to prevent an allergic reaction (e.g. antihistamines and/or corticosteroids) \nor to reduce fever (antipyretics). \nThe most common symptoms of infusion associated reactions include fever, chills, rash, hives and \nshortness of breath. \n \nVery common side effects (these may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \n \n\n Sore throat \n Gastroenteritis \n Poor reflexes \n Headache \n Inflammation of the eye \n Cloudy eyes \n Poor hearing \n High blood pressure \n \n\n Nasal congestion \n Bulging belly button \n Vomiting \n Nausea \n Itching \n Pain (including ear, abdominal, joint, chest \n\npain) \n Malaise  \n\n \nCommon side effects (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n \n\n Tremor \n Low blood pressure \n Cough \n\n Wheezing \n Skin redness \n\n \n \nOther side effects with an unknown frequency:  \n \n\n Shock \n Tingling \n Decreased heart rate \n Increased heart rate \n\n Bluish skin  \n Skin paleness \n Low blood-oxygen \n Rapid breathing \n\n \nIf you get any of these symptoms, or other symptoms not listed in this leaflet, tell your doctor \nimmediately. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side \neffects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you \ncan help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store this medicine \n \nKeep out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not take use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the vial after EXP. The expiry \ndate refers to the last day of that month. \n \nUnopened vials:  \nStore in a refrigerator (2C - 8C).  \n \nDo not freeze. \n \nDiluted solutions:  \nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for up to 4 days at room temperature \n(23C - 27C). \n \nFrom a microbiological safety point of view, the product is to be used immediately. If not used \nimmediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and must normally \nnot be longer than 24 hours at 2C - 8C followed by up to 24 hours at room temperature \n(23C - 27C) during administration. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nDo not take Naglazyme if it contains visible particles.  \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.

The concentrate for solution for infusion has \nto be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion using aseptic technique. It is \nrecommended that the diluted Naglazyme solution be administered to patients using an infusion set \nequipped with a 0.2 µm in-line filter. \n \nAny unused product or waste material is to be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \nPreparation of the Naglazyme Infusion (Use Aseptic Technique) \n \nThe number of vials to be diluted based on the individual patient's weight must be determined and \nremoved from the refrigerator approximately 20 minutes in advance in order to allow them to reach \nroom temperature. \n \nBefore dilution, each vial is to be inspected for particulate matter and discolouration. The clear to \nslightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solution must be free of visible particles.  \n \nA volume of the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion is to be withdrawn and \ndiscarded from a 250 ml infusion bag equal to the total volume of Naglazyme to be added. 100 ml \ninfusion bags should be considered for patients who are susceptible to fluid volume overload and \nweigh less than 20 kg; in this case the infusion rate (ml/min) should be decreased so that the total \nduration remains no less than 4 hours. When using 100 ml bags, the volume of Naglazyme may be \nadded directly to the infusion bag. \n \nThe volume of Naglazyme is to be slowly added to the sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for \ninfusion. \n \nThe solution is to be mixed gently for infusion. \n \nThe solution is to be visually inspected for particulate matter prior to use. Clear and colourless \nsolutions without visible particles should be used. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA MANUFACTURER OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE ANDMANUFACTURING AUTHORISATION HOLDER RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCHRELEASE\n\tB CONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATI\n\tC.
