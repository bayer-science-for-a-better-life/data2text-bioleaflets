NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nFoscan 1 mg/ml solution for injection  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach ml contains 1 mg of temoporfin.  \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effect \n\nEach ml contains 376 mg of ethanol anhydrous and 560 mg of propylene glycol.  \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection \n\nDark purple solution \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nFoscan is indicated for the palliative treatment of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell \n\ncarcinoma failing prior therapies and unsuitable for radiotherapy, surgery or systemic chemotherapy.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nFoscan photodynamic therapy must only be administered in specialist oncology centres in which a \n\nmultidisciplinary team assesses patient treatment and under the supervision of physicians experienced \n\nin photodynamic therapy.  \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe dose is 0.15 mg/kg body weight.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Foscan in the paediatric population. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFoscan is administered via an in-dwelling intravenous cannula in a large proximal limb vein, \n\npreferably in the antecubital fossa, as a single slow intravenous injection over not less than 6 minutes. \n\nThe patency of the in-dwelling cannula should be tested before injection and every precaution taken \n\nagainst extravasation (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nThe dark purple colour of the solution, together with the amber vials makes a visual check for \n\nparticulates impossible. Thus, an in-line filter must be used as a precautionary measure and is provided \n\nin the package. Foscan shall not be diluted nor flushed with sodium chloride or any other aqueous \n\nsolution. \n\n \n\nThe required dose of Foscan is administered by slow intravenous injection, over not less than 6 \n\nminutes. 96 hours after the administration of Foscan, the treatment site is to be illuminated with light \n\nat 652 nm from an approved laser source. Light must be delivered to the entire surface of the tumour \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nusing an approved microlens fibre-optic. Wherever possible, the illuminated area must extend beyond \n\nthe tumour margin by a distance of 0.5 cm. \n\n \n\nLight must be administered not less than 90 hours and not more than 110 hours after Foscan injection.  \n\n \n\nThe incident light dose is 20 J/cm2, delivered at an irradiance of 100 mW/cm2 to the tumour surface, \n\nimplying an illumination time of approximately 200 seconds. \n\n \n\nEach field is to be illuminated once only at each treatment. Multiple non-overlapping fields may be \n\nilluminated. Care must be taken to ensure that no area of tissue receives more than the specified light \n\ndose. Tissue outside the target area must be shielded completely to avoid photoactivation by scattered \n\nor reflected light. \n\n \n\nA second course of treatment may be given at the discretion of the treating physician in patients where \n\nadditional tumour necrosis and removal is deemed appropriate, with a recommended minimum \n\ninterval of 4 weeks between treatments.  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n\uf0b7 Porphyria or other diseases exacerbated by light.  \n\n\uf0b7 Hypersensitivity to porphyrins. \n\n\uf0b7 Tumours known to be eroding into a major blood vessel in or adjacent to the illumination site. \n\n\uf0b7 A planned surgical procedure within the next 30 days. \n\n\uf0b7 Co-existing ophthalmic disease likely to require slit-lamp examination within the next 30 days. \n\n\uf0b7 Existing therapy with a photosensitizing agent. \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nAll patients who receive Foscan will become temporarily photosensitive. Precautions must be taken to \n\navoid exposure of skin and eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light during the first 15 days after \n\ninjection. Skin photosensitivity reactions are caused by visible light; therefore ultraviolet sunscreens \n\nprovide no protection. It is important that patients are re-introduced to normal light gradually (see the \n\nlight protection guidelines for patients at the end of this section). \n\n \n\nFor 6 months following Foscan treatment prolonged direct sunlight exposure of the injection site arm \n\nshall be avoided. As a precautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, the injection \n\narm should be protected by wearing a long sleeved, coloured shirt.  \n\n \n\nClinicians should be aware that most of the toxicities associated with photodynamic therapy are local \n\neffects seen as consequence of photoactivation. Photoactivation induces local tissue damage resulting \n\nin acute inflammatory response. This response is commonly associated with oedema and pain, \n\nfollowed by necrosis. The photodynamic effect may also lead to damage of the surrounding tissue that \n\nmay cause fistula, perforation, or vascular rupture as well as infection and subsequent sepsis. It is \n\ntherefore important that during photoactivation by laser illumination care should be taken to protect \n\nnormal tissue surrounding the tumour from photoactivation by proper illumination and shielding \n\ntechniques. Proactively managing the local effects and diminishing photoactivation in non-tumour \n\nareas is important to manage the risks. \n\n \n\nSpecial care must be taken to prevent extravasation at the injection site. If extravasation occurs, \n\nprotect the area from light for at least 3 months. There is no known benefit from injecting the \n\nextravasation site with another substance. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions, including cholangitis, cholecystitis, liver abscess and oesophageal perforation have \n\nbeen reported after unapproved use in the treatment of malignant biliary strictures and mesothelioma. \n\nThere is a risk of damage of the surrounding area following photoactivation. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n \n\nUnplanned or emergency surgical procedures where Foscan has been administered within the previous \n\n30 days must be undertaken only if absolutely necessary and the potential benefits outweigh the risk to \n\nthe patient. All precautions must be taken to avoid direct illumination of the patient with surgical \n\nlamps during these procedures. The use of headlamps is recommended instead. \n\n \n\nSome pulse oximeters may produce light of a wavelength close to that used for the photoactivation of \n\nFoscan. Oximeters must be repositioned at least every 10-15 minutes to avoid the risk of local skin \n\nburns. \n\n \n\nPain, other than injection site pain, listed in section 4.8 may require the use of NSAIDs or opiate \n\nanalgesics for a short time following treatment. Pain occurs the day after illumination and usually lasts \n\n2 to 4 weeks. \n\n \n\nIllumination of airways may lead to local inflammation and oedema. The resulting complications (i.e. \n\ndyspnoea or even airway obstruction leading to, for instance, intubation or tracheotomy) should be \n\nanticipated. Prophylactic treatment with corticosteroids should be considered. \n\n \n\nClinicians must counsel patients to observe the following precautions that are provided in the Package \n\nLeaflet. \n\n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nTime after  \nFoscan Injection \n\nWhat should I do to prevent burns? \n\n \nDay 1 (0-24 \nhours) \n\n \nStay indoors in a darkened room. Keep the curtains drawn and use light bulbs of \n60 W or less. \nAvoid exposure to direct sunlight. \n \n\n \nDays 2-7 \n\n \nYou can gradually return to normal indoor lighting. Remember to avoid direct \nsunlight coming through the window or direct light from household \nappliances such as reading lamps. You may watch television.  \n \nYou can go outdoors after dusk. \n \nIf it is absolutely necessary to go outdoors during the hours of daylight, you \nmust be careful to cover up all your skin including your face and hands and \nwear dark glasses.  \n \nThe type of clothes you must wear are: \n\n\uf0b7 Wide-brimmed hat: for head, neck, nose and ears. \n\uf0b7 Scarf: for head and neck. \n\uf0b7 Sunglasses with side panels: for eyes and skin around eyes. \n\uf0b7 Long sleeved top: for upper body/arms. \n\uf0b7 Long trousers: for lower body/legs. \n\uf0b7 Gloves: for hands, wrist and fingers. \n\uf0b7 Socks: for feet and ankles. \n\uf0b7 Closed shoes: for feet. \n\uf0b7 Do not wear very thin clothing because it will not protect you from \n\nstrong light. Wear dark, closely woven clothing. \n\uf0b7 If you expose yourself to light by mistake, you may get a prickly or \n\nburning feeling on the skin. You must get out of the light immediately. \n \n\nYour eyes may be very sensitive to bright lights during this week. You may get \neye pain or headache when lights are switched on. If you have this problem, \nwear dark glasses. \n \n\n \nDays 8-14 \n\n \nYou can now begin to go outside during daylight hours. Stay in shaded areas or \ngo out when it is cloudy. Continue to wear dark, closely woven clothing. \n \nStart on Day 8 with 10-15 minutes outdoors. If you do not see any skin redness \nin the next 24 hours, you can gradually increase your time outdoors during the \nweek. \n \nAvoid direct sunlight or strong indoor lighting. Stay in the shade. \n \n\n \nDay 15 onward \n\n \nYour sensitivity to light is gradually getting back to normal.  \n \nYou must test this carefully by exposing the back of your hand to the sun for \n5 minutes. Wait 24 hours to see if there is any redness. If there is redness, you \nshould avoid direct sunlight for another 24 hours. You can then repeat the test. \n \nIf there is no redness, you can gradually increase your exposure to sunlight day \nby day. Do not stay in the sunlight for more than 15 minutes the first time. Most \npeople will be able to go back to their normal routine by Day 22.  \n \nOn the first day after the skin test, you can stay in direct sunlight for 15 \nminutes. You can increase your exposure by another 15 minutes each day i.e. \nsecond day 30 minutes, third day 45 minutes, fourth day 60 minutes and so on. \nIf at any time you notice a prickly or burning feeling or see skin reddening after \nexposure to sun, wait until this disappears before exposing your skin to light for \nthis length of time again. \n \nFor 30 days following Foscan treatment, avoid eye tests that use bright lights. \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nFor 3 months following Foscan treatment, avoid UV tanning beds. Do not \nsunbathe. \n \nFor 6 months following Foscan treatment, care should be taken to avoid direct \nprolonged sunlight exposure of the arm used for Foscan injection. As a \nprecautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, the injection \narm should be protected by wearing long sleeved, coloured clothing. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 48 vol % ethanol (alcohol), i.e up to 4.2 g per dose, equivalent to 84 \n\nml of beer, 35 ml wine per dose. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be taken into \n\naccount in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver \n\ndisease or epilepsy.The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may alter the effects of other \n\nmedicines.The amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may impair the ability to drive or use \n\nmachines. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThere is potential for exacerbation of skin photosensitivity if temoporfin is used with other \n\nphotosensitising active substances. Such a reaction has been reported with topical 5-fluorouracil. \n\n \n\nNo other interactions have been observed. An in vitro study with human liver tissue has shown no \n\npotential for drug interaction through inhibition of cytochrome P-450 enzymes by temoporfin. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere are no data from the use of temoporfin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown \n\nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Foscan should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical \n\ncondition of the woman requires treatment with temoporfin. \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up 3 months after \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether temoporfin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \n\nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued for at least one month \n\nfollowing injection of Foscan. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThe effects of Foscan on fertility in humans have not been studied. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe amount of alcohol in this medicinal product may impair the ability to drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nOn the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile, temoporfin is presumed to be safe or unlikely to \n\nproduce an effect. To avoid photosensitivity problems, it is advised not to drive during the first  \n\n15 days after injection, and to use machines only if it is practical to do so under subdued lighting \n\nconditions according to the recommended lighting precautions (see section 4.4). Driving and use of \n\nmachines may resume under normal lighting or daylight conditions once photosensitivity has been \n\nshown to have subsided. \n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAll patients who receive Foscan will become temporarily photosensitive and must be instructed to \n\nobserve precautions to avoid sunlight and bright indoor light. Regarding the tabulated adverse \n\nreactions gastrointestinal disorders, adverse skin reactions and general disorders and administration \n\nsite conditions are the most frequently observed adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nMost of the toxicities associated with photodynamic therapy are local effects seen in the region of \n\nillumination and occasionally in surrounding tissues. The local adverse reactions are characteristic of \n\nan acute tissue inflammatory response induced by photoactivation and commonly include oedema and \n\npain followed by necrosis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPhotosensitivity reactions may occur, however, complying with the light protection guidelines (see \n\nabove section 4.4) and avoiding unnecessary indoor light during illumination reduces this risk. \n\n \n\nThe low number of treated patients did not allow identification of adverse reactions, which may be \n\ncategorised as uncommon and rare. Injection site pain is transient and can be reduced by slowing the \n\ninjection rate. For treatment of other types of pain listed in this section, please see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 \n\nto <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from \n\nthe available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \n\ndecreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nInfections and infestations Common: \n\nLocalised infection in the area of photoactivation, \n\ne.g. pharyngitis, stomatitis \n\nUnknown: \n\nSepsis1 \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Common:  \n\nAnaemia \n\nNervous system disorders Common:  \n\nDizziness, burning sensation \n\nVascular disorders Very common:  \n\nHaemorrhage \n\nUnknown: \n\nVascular rupture: see section 4.3 \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Unknown:  \n\nAirway obstruction3 \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common:  \n\nConstipation, stomatitis necrotising, dysphagia \n\nCommon:  \n\nVomiting, nausea, mouth ulceration \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common:  \n\nBlister, erythema, skin hyperpigmentations, \n\nphotosensitivity reaction, skin necrosis2 \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone \n\ndisorders \n\nCommon:  \n\nTrismus3 \n\nUnknown: \n\nFistula2 \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\nVery common:  \n\nPain in the photoactivated area, e.g. facial pain, \n\nheadache, injection site pain, oedema in the \n\nphotoactivated area, e.g. face oedema, tongue \n\noedema \n\nCommon: \n\nPyrexia, injection site reaction, oedema \n\nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications Very common:  \n\nScar2 \n\nCommon:  \n\nThermal burn, sunburn2 \n1 As a consequence of local infection \n2 In the photoactivated area \n3 As a consequence of local oedema \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn the event of an overdose, laser treatment would result in deeper tumour necrosis than would be \n\nexpected with the recommended dose. Illumination of the tumour should only be carried out if the \n\npotential benefit justifies the potential risk of excessive necrosis. If the tumour is not illuminated, a \n\nperiod of at least 4 weeks between overdose and re-administration of Foscan must be allowed. \n\n \n\nThe adverse reactions associated with overdose would be expected to be limited to photosensitivity \n\nreactions. Exposure to ambient light after overdose carries an increased risk of photosensitivity \n\nreactions. Published clinical research has shown that the duration and intensity of photosensitivity at \n\nthe recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg were reduced by one third relative to a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. \n\nAnimal studies have shown some haematological and blood chemistry changes (decreased platelets, \n\nerythrocytes and haemoglobin, increased neutrophils, fibrinogen, bilirubin, triglyceride and \n\ncholesterol).  \n\n \n\nStrict observance of the reduced light regime is required. A skin photosensitivity test must be carried \n\nout before the patient returns to normal light conditions. \n\n \n\nNo specific systemic symptoms are known to be associated with overdose. Treatment should be \n\nsupportive. \n\n \n\nLimited information is available on the effects of overexposure to laser light during treatment. \n\nIncreased damage to tissue was noted. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XD05. \n\n \n\nTemoporfin is a photosensitising agent used in the photodynamic therapy of tumours.  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacological activity is initiated by photoactivation of temoporfin with non-thermal light at \n\n652 nm following intravenous administration. The therapeutic effect is mediated through the \n\n\n\n 9 \n\ngeneration of highly reactive oxygen species, a process dependent on the intracellular interaction of \n\ntemoporfin with light and oxygen. \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial of 147 patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, tumour \n\nresponse, defined as a reduction of a minimum of 50 % of the tumour mass for a minimum of four \n\nweeks, was observed in 25 % after a single treatment. A WHO local complete response was observed \n\nin 14 % of patients. Tumour responses are enhanced in patients with fully illuminated lesions of \n\n10 mm or less in depth.  \n\n \n\nThe median observed duration of tumour response for all patients was 57 days for overall response and \n\n84 days for complete response.  \n \n\nThirty-seven patients received at least 2 treatments with Foscan. Ten patients achieved a tumour \n\nresponse due to re-treatment. Of these, 6 had a complete local response according to WHO criteria. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nTemoporfin is a low clearance substance with a terminal plasma half-life of 65 hours in patients. Peak \n\nplasma levels occur at 2-4 hours post-injection thereafter plasma levels decline in a bi-exponential \n\nmanner. An extensive volume of distribution is observed that is intermediate between total and \n\nextracellular body water. Temoporfin does not concentrate in the tissues. Plasma protein binding is at \n\n85-87 %. Temoporfin is bound to plasma lipoproteins and high density proteins such as albumin in the \n\nblood. By 15 days post-infusion, temoporfin plasma concentration has declined to background such \n\nthat patients are generally able to begin a gradual return to normal outdoor lighting conditions. \n\n \n\nLimited data are available on the elimination of temoporfin in humans. Animal data show temoporfin \n\nis exclusively eliminated by the liver into the bile and excreted in the faeces. Two major metabolites of \n\ntemoporfin are eliminated into the bile. There is no enterohepatic recirculation of these metabolites. \n\nBoth these metabolites show conjugated character. No metabolites are seen in the systemic circulation. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, the main undesirable effects of temoporfin were \n\nphototoxicity and adverse injection site reactions. Local irritancy of Foscan solution for injection after \n\nintravenous administration occurred with all doses. High rates of administration caused death in dogs \n\nand rabbits. No other signs of toxicity were found, however, in dogs treated with the recommended \n\ntherapeutic dose, systemic exposure exceeded that of humans. \n\n \n\nThe genotoxicity of temoporfin has been investigated to a limited extent. Due to the generation of \n\nreactive oxygen species, temoporfin poses a minor risk of mutagenicity. This risk can be controlled in \n\nthe clinical situation by minimising direct exposure to light (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nIn developmental toxicity studies in rabbits, temoporfin, at systemic exposures equal to those obtained \n\nin humans with the recommended therapeutic dose, caused an increase in early post-implantation loss. \n\nAlthough no other developmental effects were observed, the applied doses were not sufficiently in \n\nexcess of the human therapeutic dose to provide an adequate margin of safety. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What you need to know before you use Foscan  \n\n3. How to use Foscan \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store Foscan \n\n6.  Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Foscan is and what it is used for \n \n\nThe active ingredient in Foscan is temoporfin.  \n\n \n\nFoscan is a porphyrin photosensitising medicine, which increases your sensitivity to light and is \n\nactivated by light from a laser in a treatment called photodynamic therapy. \n\n \n\nFoscan is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer in patients who cannot be treated with other \n\ntherapies. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Foscan \n \n\nDo not use Foscan \n- if you are allergic to temoporfin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6), \n\n- if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to porphyrins, \n- if you have porphyria, or any other disease that is made worse by light, \n- if the tumour being treated goes through a large blood vessel, \n- if you are going to have an operation in the next 30 days, \n- if you have an eye disease which needs examination with bright light in the next 30 days, \n- if you are already being treated with a photosensitising agent. \n\n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Foscan will make you sensitive to light for about 15 days after your injection. This means that \nnormal daylight or bright indoor lighting could give you skin burns. To stop this, you must \n\nfollow carefully the instructions for gradual exposure to increasing light levels indoors over \n\nthe first week and outdoor, shaded light during the second week after treatment (please see the \n\ntable at the end of this leaflet).  \n\n\uf0b7 Please speak to your doctor about this before you go home after being injected with Foscan.  \n\n\uf0b7 Sunscreen creams will not prevent this sensitivity.  \n\n\uf0b7 You will gradually become less sensitive to light. Normally, people are able to begin to return \nto normal outdoor lighting after 15 days.  \n\n\uf0b7 Do not let an optician or ophthalmologist examine your eyes with bright lights for 30 days \nafter Foscan injection. \n\n\uf0b7 Do not use UV sunbeds or sunbathe for 3 months after Foscan injection. \n\n\uf0b7 For 6 months following Foscan treatment, avoid prolonged direct sunlight exposure of the \ninjection site arm. As a precautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, \n\nprotect your injection arm by wearing long sleeved, coloured clothing. \n\n \n\nThe table of instructions tells you what to do to prevent skin burns. You must follow these \n\ninstructions carefully.  \n\n \n\nPlease ask your doctor or nurse if you are not sure about anything. \n\n \nTime after  \n\nFoscan Injection \nWhat should I do to prevent burns? \n\n \nDay 1 (0-24 \nhours) \n\n \nStay indoors in a darkened room. Keep the curtains drawn and use light bulbs of \n60 W or less. \nAvoid exposure to direct sunlight. \n \n\n \nDays 2-7 \n\n \nYou can gradually return to normal indoor lighting. Remember to avoid direct \nsunlight coming through the window or direct light from household \nappliances such as reading lamps. You may watch television.  \n \nYou can go outdoors after dusk. \n \nIf it is absolutely necessary to go outdoors during the hours of daylight, you \nmust be careful to cover up all your skin including your face and hands and \nwear dark glasses.  \n \nThe type of clothes you must wear are: \n\n\uf0b7 Wide-brimmed hat: for head, neck, nose and ears. \n\uf0b7 Scarf: for head and neck. \n\uf0b7 Sunglasses with side panels: for eyes and skin around eyes. \n\uf0b7 Long sleeved top: for upper body/arms. \n\uf0b7 Long trousers: for lower body/legs. \n\uf0b7 Gloves: for hands, wrist and fingers. \n\uf0b7 Socks: for feet and ankles. \n\uf0b7 Closed shoes: for feet. \n\uf0b7 Do not wear very thin clothing because it will not protect you from \n\nstrong light. Wear dark, closely woven clothing. \n\uf0b7 If you expose yourself to light by mistake, you may get a prickly or \n\nburning feeling on the skin. You must get out of the light immediately. \n \n\nYour eyes may be very sensitive to bright lights during this week. You may get \neye pain or headache when lights are switched on. If you have this problem, \nwear dark glasses. \n \n\n \nDays 8-14 \n\n \nYou can now begin to go outside during daylight hours. Stay in shaded areas or \ngo out when it is cloudy. Continue to wear dark, closely woven clothing. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n \nStart on Day 8 with 10-15 minutes outdoors. If you do not see any skin redness \nin the next 24 hours, you can gradually increase your time outdoors during the \nweek. \n \nAvoid direct sunlight or strong indoor lighting. Stay in the shade. \n \n\n \nDay 15 onward \n\n \nYour sensitivity to light is gradually getting back to normal.  \n \nYou must test this carefully by exposing the back of your hand to the sun for \n5 minutes. Wait 24 hours to see if there is any redness. If there is redness, you \nshould avoid direct sunlight for another 24 hours. You can then repeat the test. \n \nIf there is no redness, you can gradually increase your exposure to sunlight day \nby day. Do not stay in the sunlight for more than 15 minutes the first time. Most \npeople will be able to go back to their normal routine by Day 22.  \n \nOn the first day after the skin test, you can stay in direct sunlight for 15 \nminutes. You can increase your exposure by another 15 minutes each day i.e. \nsecond day 30 minutes, third day 45 minutes, fourth day 60 minutes and so on. \nIf at any time you notice a prickly or burning feeling or see skin reddening after \nexposure to sun, wait until this disappears before exposing your skin to light for \nthis length of time again. \n \nFor 30 days following Foscan treatment, avoid eye tests that use bright lights. \nFor 3 months following Foscan treatment, avoid UV tanning beds. Do not \nsunbathe. \n \nFor 6 months following Foscan treatment, care should be taken to avoid direct \nprolonged sunlight exposure of the arm used for Foscan injection. As a \nprecautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, the injection \narm should be protected by wearing long sleeved, coloured clothing. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Foscan \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n\uf0b7 You must avoid becoming pregnant for 3 months after Foscan treatment. \n\n\uf0b7 Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant. \n \n\nDo not breast-feed for at least 1 month after Foscan injection. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n\uf0b7 The amount of alcohol in this medicine may impair your ability to drive or use machines for a \nfew hours after injection.  \n\n\uf0b7 It is not recommended to drive or operate machines for the first 15 days after Foscan injection, \nbecause of the recommended light exposure restrictions \n\n \n\nFoscan contains ethanol (alcohol): \n\n\uf0b7 This product contains 48 vol % ethanol (alcohol), i.e up to 4.2 g per dose, equivalent to 84 ml \nof beer, 35 ml wine per dose. This product is also harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. \n\nPregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk groups such as patients with liver \n\ndisease or epilepsy are also at risk. \n\nThe amount of alcohol in this product may alter the effects of other medicines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Foscan \n \n\n\uf0b7 Your doctor or nurse will give you Foscan by a slow injection into a vein, which will take \napproximately 6 minutes. \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Four days after your injection, your doctor will treat your cancer with laser light. Your doctor \nwill cover the normal tissue surrounding your cancer and then shine the laser light directly at \n\nthe cancer for about 5 minutes. The laser light is not hot and will not burn. \n\n \n\nIf you are given more Foscan than you should \n\n\uf0b7 You may not be given the laser treatment.  \n\n\uf0b7 You may be sensitive to light for more than 15 days.  \n \n\nYou must follow carefully the instructions on preventing skin burns. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, Foscan can cause side effects.  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7 Everyone who takes Foscan will become sensitive to light for about 15 days after injection. \n\n\uf0b7 You must follow the instructions given to you to avoid sunlight and bright indoor light.  \n\n\uf0b7 These instructions are written in this leaflet. Your doctor will also tell you what to do.  \n\nIf you do not follow these instructions, you may get severe sunburn that leads to permanent \n\nscarring. \n\n \n\nMost of the side effects related with photodynamic therapy are local effects seen as consequence of \n\ntriggering the Foscan with the laser. You may feel pain after the laser treatment. This pain will be \n\ncontrolled with painkillers. Please let your doctor or nurse know if you have pain or if the painkillers \n\nyou have been given are not taking the pain away. Furthermore you will probably notice swelling and \n\nreddening around the area that has been treated. You may be given some medicine to reduce the \n\nswelling. After 2 to 4 days, the treated area will turn black. This blackness is caused by dead cancer \n\ncells (necrosis). Foscan may also damage the tissue that is surrounding the tumour. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 You may feel some pain when Foscan is injected.  \n\n\uf0b7 After the laser treatment, you may feel pain in the treated area, e.g. pain in your face or \nheadache. \n\n\uf0b7 There may also be bleeding, ulcers, swelling in the treated area like swelling of your face or \ntongue, and scarring. \n\n\uf0b7 You may get constipation. \nThese effects may make it difficult to eat and drink.  \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\n\uf0b7 There may be some irritation, a burning sensation or skin damage where Foscan is injected, \nbut this will not last long.  \n\n\uf0b7 You may also get ulcers, blisters, skin redness, or skin darkening.  \n\n\uf0b7 Vomiting \n\n\uf0b7 Fever \n\n\uf0b7 Nausea \n\n\uf0b7 Anaemia \n\n\uf0b7 Light sensitivity \n\n\uf0b7 Sunburn \n\n\uf0b7 Burns \n\n\uf0b7 Difficulty with swallowing \n\n\uf0b7 Giddiness  \n\n\uf0b7 There may be swelling or you may have a stiff jaw. Some people may get an infection in the \ntreated area, e.g. inflammation of the throat or mouth. \n\n\n\n 24 \n\n \n\nEvents occurring at a frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata): \n\n\uf0b7 Airway blocking as consequence of swelling in the treated area \n\n\uf0b7 Fistula in the treated area \n\n\uf0b7 Sepsis \n\n\uf0b7 Vascular rupture \n \n\nSerious side effects such as inflammation of bile duct or gallbladder, liver abscess or perforation in the \n\ntreated area have been reported when used in other cancer than head and neck. Talk to your doctor for \n\nmore information. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

PACK CONTENTS \n \n\nThe active substance is temoporfin. Each ml of solution contains 1 mg of temoporfin. The excipients \n\nare ethanol anhydrous and propylene glycol. A filter with Luer lock connections for syringe and \n\ncannula is provided. \n\n \n\nEach pack provides 1 vial containing 1 ml, 3 ml or 6 ml solution for injection. \n\n \n\nEach vial represents a single dose and any unused solution must be discarded. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. CALCULATION OF DOSE \n \n\nCalculate the required dose of Foscan according to the bodyweight of the patient. The dose is  \n\n0.15 mg/kg bodyweight. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. ADMINISTRATION OF FOSCAN (96 hours prior to laser illumination of treatment site) \n \n\nFoscan must be administered intravenously via an in-dwelling cannula in a large proximal limb vein, \n\npreferably in the antecubital fossa. The patency of the in-dwelling cannula should be tested before \n\ninjection. \n\n \n\nThe dark purple colour of the solution together with the amber vial makes a visual check for \n\nparticulates impossible. Thus, an in-line filter must be used as a precautionary measure and is provided \n\nin the package. \n\n \n\nDraw up the entire contents of the vial containing Foscan into a syringe and expel air (Figure 1). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nAttach the filter to the syringe (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \n\n \n\nPress the syringe plunger to fill all dead space within the filter. Continue pressing the plunger to expel \n\nexcess Foscan until the required volume is left in the syringe, allowing sufficient to cover the dead \n\nspace in the intravenous cannula (Figure 3). \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nAttach the syringe and filter to the cannula. Administer the required dose of Foscan by slow \n\nintravenous injection, over not less than 6 minutes (Figure 4). \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \n\n \n\n \n\nRemove the intravenous cannula immediately following the injection. Do NOT flush with \n\naqueous solutions such as sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection or water for \n\ninjections. \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecial care should be taken to prevent extravasation at the injection site. If extravasation occurs, \n\nprotect the area from light for at least 3 months. There is no known benefit from injecting the \n\nextravasation site with another substance. \n\n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n \n\nFoscan is photosensitive. Once removed from its packaging it should be administered immediately. \n\nWhere delay is unavoidable, the solution must be protected from light. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. LASER ILLUMINATION OF TREATMENT SITE \n \n\nPlease refer to the laser user manual, and to the microlens fibre-optic user leaflet. \n\n \n\n96 hours after the administration of Foscan, the treatment site is to be illuminated with light at 652 nm \n\nfrom an approved laser source. Light must be delivered to the entire surface of the tumour using an \n\napproved microlens fibre-optic. Wherever possible, the illuminated area must extend beyond the \n\ntumour margin by a distance of 0.5 cm. \n\n \n\nLight must be administered not less than 90 hours and not more than 110 hours after Foscan injection.  \n\n \n\nThe incident light dose is 20 J/cm2, delivered by the microlens fibre-optic in a circular field to the \n\ntumour surface at an irradiance of 100 mW/cm2, implying an illumination time of 200 seconds. \n\n \n\nEach field is to be illuminated once only at each treatment. Multiple non-overlapping fields may be \n\nilluminated. Care must be taken to ensure that no area of tissue receives more than the specified light \n\ndose. Tissue outside the target area must be shielded completely to avoid photoactivation by scattered \n\nor reflected light. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. SAFETY INFORMATION \n\n \n\nFoscan is non-irritant. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

by exposing the back of your hand to the sun for 5 minutes. wait 24 hours to see if there is any redness. if there is redness, you should avoid direct sunlight for another 24 hours. you can then repeat the test. if there is no redness, you can gradually increase your exposure to sunlight day by day. do not stay in the sunlight for more than 15 minutes the first time. most people will be able to go back to their normal routine by day 22. on the first day after the skin test, you can stay in direct sunlight for 15 minutes. you can increase your exposure by another 15 minutes each day i.e. second day 30 minutes, third day 45 minutes, fourth day 60 minutes and so on. if at any time you notice a prickly or burning feeling or see skin reddening after exposure to sun, wait until this disappears before exposing your skin to light for this length of time again. for 30 days following foscan treatment, avoid eye tests that use bright lights. for 3 months following foscan treatment, avoid uv tanning beds. do not sunbathe. for 6 months following foscan treatment, care should be taken to avoid direct prolonged sunlight exposure of the arm used for foscan injection. as a

sunlight and bright indoor light. these instructions are written in this leaflet. your doctor will also tell you what to do. if you do not follow these instructions, you may get severe sunburn that leads to permanent scarring. most of the side effects related with photodynamic therapy are local effects seen as consequence of triggering the foscan with the laser. you may feel pain after the laser treatment. this pain will be controlled with painkillers. please let your doctor or nurse know if you have pain or if the painkillers you have been given are not taking the pain away. furthermore you will probably notice swelling and reddening around the area that has been treated. you may be given some medicine to reduce the swelling. after 2 to 4 days, the treated area will turn black. this blackness is caused by dead cancer cells (necrosis). foscan may also damage the tissue that is surrounding the tumour. very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): you may feel some pain when foscan is injected. after the laser treatment, you may feel pain in the treated area, e.g. pain in your face or headache. there may also be bleeding, ulcers, swelling in the treated area like swelling of your face or tongue, and scarring. you may get constipation. these effects may make it difficult to eat and drink. common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): there may be some irritation, a burning sensation or skin damage where foscan is injected, but this will not last long. you may also get ulcers, blisters, skin redness, or skin darkening. vomiting fever nausea anaemia light sensitivity sunburn burns difficulty with swallowing giddiness there may be swelling or you may have a stiff jaw. some people may get an infection in the treated area, e.g. inflammation of the throat or mouth. events occurring at a frequency not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): airway blocking as consequence of swelling in the treated area fistula in the treated area sepsis vascular rupture serious side effects such as inflammation of bile duct or gallbladder, liver abscess or perforation in the treated area have been reported when used in other cancer than head and neck. talk to your doctor for more information. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. this includes any possible side effects not
