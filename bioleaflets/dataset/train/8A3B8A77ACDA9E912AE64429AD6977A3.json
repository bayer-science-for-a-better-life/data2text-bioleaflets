This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVeraSeal solutions for sealant \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nComponent 1: \nHuman fibrinogen 80 mg/ml \n \nComponent 2: \nHuman thrombin 500 IU/ml \n \nProduced from the plasma of human donors. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolutions for sealant. \n \nFrozen solutions. After thawing, the solutions are clear or slightly opalescent and colourless or pale \nyellow. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSupportive treatment in adults where standard surgical techniques are insufficient: \n \n- for improvement of haemostasis. \n- as suture support: in vascular surgery. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nThe use of VeraSeal is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of this \nmedicinal product. \n \nPosology \n \nThe volume of VeraSeal to be applied and the frequency of application should always be oriented \ntowards the underlying clinical needs for the patient. \n \nThe dose to be applied is governed by variables including, but not limited to, the type of surgical \nintervention, the size of the area and the mode of intended application, and the number of applications. \n \nApplication of the product must be individualised by the treating physician. In clinical trials, the \nindividual dosages have typically ranged from 0.3 to 12 ml. For other procedures, larger volumes may \nbe required. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe initial volume of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should \nbe sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area. The application can be repeated, if \nnecessary. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of VeraSeal in children aged 0 to 18 years has not yet been established. \nCurrently available data are described in section 5.1, but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor epilesional use. \n \nFor instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The \nproduct should only be administered according to the instructions and with the devices recommended \nfor this product (see section 6.6.). \n \nPrior to applying VeraSeal, the surface area of the wound needs to be dried by standard techniques \n(e.g. intermittent application of compresses, swabs, use of suction devices). \n \nFor spray application, see sections 4.4 and 6.6 for specific recommendations on the required distance \nfrom tissue per surgical procedure. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nVeraSeal must not be applied intravascularly. \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nVeraSeal must not be used for the treatment of severe or brisk arterial bleeding. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nPrecautions for use \n \nFor epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly. \n \nLife threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied \nintravascularly (see section 4.8). \n \nVeraSeal spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance, \nespecially during laparoscopy. Spray distance from tissue should be within the range recommended by \nthe marketing authorisation holder of VeraSeal (see section 6.6). \n \nWhen using accessory tips, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed. \n \nBefore administration of VeraSeal, care must be taken that the parts of the body outside the desired \napplication area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites. \n \nVeraSeal should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the \nproduct\u2019s efficacy and the wound healing process. \n \nAdequate data are not available to support the use of this product in tissue gluing, neurosurgery, \napplication through a flexible endoscope for treatment of bleeding or in gastrointestinal anastomoses. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nAs with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of \nhypersensitivity reactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, \nhypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration must be discontinued \nimmediately. In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  \n \nTransmissible agents \n \nStandard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from \nhuman blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma \npools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the \ninactivation /removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or \nplasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. \nThis also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The \nmeasures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. \nParvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals \nwith immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. haemolytic anaemia). \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal interaction studies have been performed. Similar to comparable products or thrombin \nsolutions, the product may be denatured after exposure to solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy \nmetals (e.g. antiseptic solutions). Such substances should be removed to the greatest possible extent \nbefore applying the product.  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nThe safety of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products for use in human pregnancy or breast-feeding has not \nbeen established in controlled clinical trials. Experimental animal studies are insufficient to assess the \nsafety with respect to reproduction, development of the embryo or foetus, the course of gestation and \nperi- and post-natal development. Therefore, the product should be administered to pregnant and \nbreast-feeding women only if clearly needed. \n \nFertility \n \nFertility studies have not been conducted. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \napplication site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, \nlethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may \noccur in rare cases in patients treated with fibrin sealant/haemostatic products. In isolated cases, these \nreactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen, if the \npreparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to \nconstituents of the product.  \n \nAntibodies against components of fibrin sealant/haemostatic products may occur rarely.  \n \nInadvertent intravascular injection could lead to thromboembolic event and disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation (DIC), and there is also a risk of anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4).  \n \nFor safety information with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention:  \n\n- Very common (\u22651/10)  \n- common (\u22651/100 to <1/10)  \n- uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100)  \n- rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000)  \n- very rare (<1/10,000)  \n- not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing of seriousness. \n \nFrequency of Adverse Reactions (ADRs) in clinical studies with VeraSeal:  \n \nMedDRA System Organ \nClass (SOC) Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations Abdominal abscess, cellulitis, liver \nabscess, peritonitis, postoperative \nwound infection, wound infection \nincision site infection, post procedural \ninfection. \n\nUncommon \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps) \n\nPlasma cell myeloma Uncommon \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nAnaemia, haemorrhagic anaemia, \nleukocytosis, leukopenia \n\nUncommon \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity* Unknown \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders  \n\nHyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, \nhypocalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, \nhypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia, \nhyponatraemia, hypoproteinaemia \n\nUncommon \n\nPsychiatric disorders Anxiety, insomnia Uncommon \nNervous system disorders Headache, somnolence Uncommon \n\n\n\n6 \n\nMedDRA System Organ \nClass (SOC) Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nEye disorders Conjunctival irritation Uncommon \nCardiac disorders Atrial fibrillation, ventricular \n\ntachycardia \nUncommon \n\nVascular disorders \n \n\nDeep vein thrombosis, hypertension, \nhypotension \n\nUncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nPulmonary embolism, dyspnoea, \nhypoxia, pleural effusion, pleurisy, \npulmonary oedema, rhonchi, wheezing \n\nUncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Nausea  Common \nConstipation, flatulence, ileus, \nretroperitoneal haematoma, vomiting  \n\nUncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nPruritus \n \n\nCommon \n\nEcchymosis, erythema Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nBack pain, pain in extremity Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Bladder spasm, dysuria, urinary \nretention \n\nUncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nChills, hyperthermia, oedema \nperipheral, pain, pyrexia, vessel \npuncture site haematoma \n\nUncommon \n\nInvestigations Parvovirus B19 test positive, activated \npartial thromboplastin time prolonged, \nalanine aminotransferase increased, \naspartate aminotransferase increased, \nblood bilirubin increase, blood glucose \nincrease, international normalised ratio \nincreased, prothrombin time prolonged, \ntransaminases increased, urine output \ndecreased \n\nUncommon \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDrug specific antibody present* Unknown \nInjury, poisoning and \nprocedural complications \n\nProcedural pain Common \n\nAbdominal wound dehiscence, post \nprocedural bile leak, contusion, incision \nsite erythema, incision site pain, post \nprocedural haemorrhage, procedural \nhypotension, vascular graft \ncomplication, vascular graft thrombosis, \nwound secretion \n\nUncommon \n\n*All these reactions are class effect.

It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse \nreactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive measures instituted. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, local hemostatics, ATC code: B02BC \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe fibrin adhesion system initiates the last phase of physiological blood coagulation. Conversion of \nfibrinogen into fibrin occurs by the splitting of fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and fibrinopeptides. \nThe fibrin monomers aggregate and form a fibrin clot. Factor XIIIa, which is activated from \nfactor XIII by thrombin, crosslinks fibrin. Calcium ions are required for both, the conversion of \nfibrinogen and the crosslinkage of fibrin.  \n \nAs wound healing progresses, increased fibrinolytic activity is induced by plasmin and decomposition \nof fibrin to fibrin degradation products is initiated. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nRandomized, single-blind clinical studies with VeraSeal were conducted in subjects undergoing \nvascular, parenchymous tissue and soft tissue surgery demonstrating haemostasis, and suture support \nin vascular surgery. \n \nDuring the vascular surgery study 225 subjects were enrolled and underwent vascular surgical \nprocedures utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene graft material on end-to-side arterial anastomosis or on \nupper extremity vascular access arterial anastomosis. The mean age of the study population and its \nstandard deviation was 63.2 (9.5) years. The most frequent surgery types were femoral-popliteal \nbypass grafting, upper extremity vascular access for hemodialysis, and ilio-femoral bypass grafting. \nVeraSeal was shown to be superior to the control group (manual compression) in achieving hemostasis \nby 4 minutes. The rate of hemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes was 76.1% in the \nVeraSeal treatment group and was 22.8% in the control group.  \n \nDuring parenchymous tissue surgery study 325 subjects were enrolled and underwent liver resections. \nThe mean age of the study population and its standard deviation was 57.9 (14.5) years. VeraSeal was \nshown to be superior to the control group (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in achieving hemostasis by \n4 minutes. The rate of hemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes was 92.8% in the VeraSeal \ntreatment group and was 80.5% in the control group.  \n \nDuring soft tissue surgery study 327 subjects were enrolled and underwent pelvic and retroperitoneal \nsurgical procedures, and abdominoplasties and mastopexies. The mean age of the study population and \nits standard deviation was 47.2 (18.4) years. The most frequent surgery types were simple or radical \nhysterectomies, abdominoplasties, and radical cystectomies. VeraSeal was shown to be non-inferior to \nthe control group (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in achieving hemostasis by 4 minutes. The rate of \nhemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes was 82.8% in the VeraSeal treatment group and \nwas 77.8% in the control group.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nEleven paediatric subjects aged 16 years or younger were treated with VeraSeal in the described \nclinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nVeraSeal in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of haemorrhage \nresulting from a surgical procedure as per paediatric investigational plan (PIP) decision, for the \ngranted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nVeraSeal is intended for epilesional use only. Intravascular administration is contraindicated. \nConsequently, intravascular pharmacokinetic studies were not performed in man.  \n \nFibrin sealant/haemostatic products are metabolised in the same way as endogenous fibrin by \nfibrinolysis and phagocytosis.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and acute toxicity. \n \n \n6.

The Airless Spray Tips are radiopaque. See scheme below. \n\n \n \n \nVeraSeal is available in the following pack sizes:  \n- VeraSeal 2 ml (containing 1 ml of human fibrinogen and 1 ml of human thrombin)  \n- VeraSeal 4 ml (containing 2 ml of human fibrinogen and 2 ml of human thrombin) \n- VeraSeal 6 ml (containing 3 ml of human fibrinogen and 3 ml of human thrombin) \n- VeraSeal 10 ml (containing 5 ml of human fibrinogen and 5 ml of human thrombin) \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nThe instructions for use are also described in the healthcare professionals\u2019 package leaflet part. \n \nRemove carton from freezer, open it and take out the two blisters. \n \nPlace the blister containing the Dual Applicator at room temperature until the fibrin sealant is ready to \nuse. \n \n\u2022 Room temperature thawing (preferred method) \n\n \nThaw blister with VeraSeal pre-filled syringes at room temperature using the following steps: \n \n1. Place the blister containing the syringe holder with pre-filled syringes on a surface at \n\nroom temperature (20 \u00baC \u2013 25 \u00baC) \n for approximately 70 minutes for the 2 ml and the 4 ml package sizes   \n for approximately 90 minutes for the 6 ml and the 10 ml package sizes \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nAfter thawing, it is not necessary to warm the product for its use. \n \nAfter thawing the solutions must be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow. \nSolutions that are cloudy or have deposits should not be used. \n \nPost-Thawing Storage \n \nAfter thawing, the kit containing the VeraSeal syringe holder with pre-filled syringes and Dual \nApplicator can be stored before use for not more than 48 hours in the refrigerator at 2 \u2013 8 \u00baC or \n24 hours at room temperature (20 - 25 \u00b0C) if it remains sealed in the original packaging. Once \nthe blisters are opened, use VeraSeal immediately and discard any unused contents.  \n \nOnce thawed, do not refreeze. \n \nTransferring instructions  \n \n1. After thawing, remove the blister from surface at room temperature or from the \n\nrefrigerator at 2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C. \n2. Open the blister and make the VeraSeal syringe holder with pre-filled syringes available \n\nto a second person for transfer to the sterile field. The outside of the blister should not \ncome in contact with the sterile field. See Figure 1. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 \n\n \n\u2022 Sterile Water Bath (Quick Thawing)  \n\n \nThaw VeraSeal pre-filled syringes inside the sterile field in a sterile thermostatic water bath at a \ntemperature not higher than 37 \u00baC using the following steps:  \n \nNOTE: Once the VeraSeal blisters are opened, use the product immediately. Use sterile \ntechnique to avoid the possibility of contamination due to improper handling, and follow the \nsteps below accurately. Do not remove the syringe luer cap until thawing is complete and the \nDual Applicator is ready to be attached. \n\n  \n 1.  Open the blister and make the VeraSeal syringe holder with pre-filled syringes available \n\nto a second person for transfer to the sterile field. The outside of the blister should not \ncome in contact with the sterile field. See Figure 1. \n\n 2.  Place the syringe holder with pre-filled syringes directly into the sterile water bath \nensuring that it is completely immersed in the water. See Figure 2.   \n\n 3.  At 37 \u00baC, the time needed is approximately 5 minutes for the 2 ml, 4 ml, 6 ml, and 10 ml \npackage sizes, but must not be left at this temperature for longer than 10 minutes.   \nThe temperature of the water bath must not exceed 37 \u00baC. \n\n 4.  Dry the syringe holder with pre-filled syringes after thawing, using a sterile surgical \ngauze. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 \n\n \nAfter thawing, the solutions must be clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Do \nnot use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \n \nUse VeraSeal immediately and discard any unused contents.  \n \n\n\u2022 Connection instructions \n \n1. Open the blister and make the VeraSeal Dual Applicator and two additional Airless Spray \n\nTips available to a second person for transfer to the sterile field. The outside of the blister \nshould not come in contact with the sterile field. \n\n2. Hold the VeraSeal syringe holder with syringe luer caps pointed upward. See Figure 3. \n 3. Unscrew and discard the syringe luer cap of both fibrinogen and thrombin syringes. See \n\nFigure 3.  \n\n  \nFigure 3 \n\n \n4. Hold the syringe holder with the luers pointed upward. To remove air bubbles from \n\nsyringes, strike gently the side of the syringe holder one or two times while keeping the \nsyringe holder in an upright position and lightly depress the plunger to eject air. See \nFigure 4. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nFigure 4 \n \n\n 5. Attach the Dual Applicator. See Figure 5. \n NOTE: Do not depress plunger during attachment or prior to intended use because the \n\ntwo biologic components will pre-mix in the Airless Spray Tip, forming a fibrin clot that \nprevents dispensing. See Figure 6.  \n \n\n \n Figure 5 \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n Figure 6 \n \n6. Tighten luer locks and ensure the Dual Applicator is firmly attached. The device is now \n\nready to use. \n \n\n\u2022 Administration \n \nApply VeraSeal using the syringe holder and plunger supplied. \n \nApply VeraSeal using the Dual Applicator provided with the product. Other CE-marked \napplicator tips (including open surgery and laparoscopic use devices) intended for specific use \nwith VeraSeal may also be used. When using the provided Dual Applicator, follow the \nconnection instructions described above. When using other applicator tips, follow the \ninstructions for use that are provided with the applicator tips. \n \n\n Application by spraying \n \n1. Grasp and bend the Dual Applicator to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape. \n2. Position the Airless Spray Tip at least 2 cm away from the target tissue. Apply firm even \n\npressure to the plunger to spray the fibrin sealant. Increase distance accordingly to \nachieve desired coverage of the target area. \n\n3. If expression is stopped for any reason, change the Airless Spray Tip. To change the \nAirless Spray Tip, remove the device from the patient and unscrew the used Airless Spray \nTip. See Figure 7. Place the used Airless Spray Tip away from the spare Airless Spray \nTips. Wipe the end of the applicator using dry or moist sterile surgical gauze. Then, \nconnect a new Airless Spray Tip provided in the package and ensure it is firmly \nconnected before use.  \nNOTE: Red indicator will not be visible if Airless Spray Tip is properly connected. See \nFigure 8. \nNOTE: Do not continue pushing the plunger in an attempt to clear the fibrin clot within \nthe Airless Spray Tip; otherwise the applicator may become unusable. \nNOTE: Do not trim the Dual Applicator to avoid exposing internal wire. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 \n\n \nFigure 8 \n \n\n Application by dripping \n \n\n1. Remove the Airless Spray Tip portion of the spray and drip tip by unscrewing the Airless \nSpray Tip. See Figure 7.  \n\n2. Grasp and bend the drip tip to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape. \n3. During dripping, keep the end of the drip tip as close to the tissue surface as possible \n\nwithout touching the tissue during application.  \n4. Apply individual drops to the surface area to be treated. To prevent uncontrolled clotting, \n\nallow the drops to separate from each other and from the end of the drip tip.  \n NOTE: Do not reconnect a used drip tip after it has been removed from the adapter; \n\notherwise a clot may form inside the drip tip and the applicator may become unusable. \n \n\n\u2022 Disposal \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n29 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nVeraSeal solutions for sealant \nhuman fibrinogen/human thrombin \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What VeraSeal is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are treated with VeraSeal  \n3. How VeraSeal is used \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How VeraSeal is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What VeraSeal is and what it is used for \n \nVeraSeal contains human fibrinogen and human thrombin, two proteins extracted from the blood that \nform a clot when they are mixed together. \n \nVeraSeal is used as a sealant during surgical operations in adults. It is applied to the surface of \nbleeding tissue to reduce bleeding during and after the operation when standard surgical techniques are \nnot sufficient. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are treated with VeraSeal  \n \nYour surgeon must not treat you with VeraSeal \n \n- if you are allergic to human fibrinogen or human thrombin or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6). \n \nVeraSeal must not be applied inside blood vessels. \n \nVeraSeal must not be used to treat severe or rapid bleeding from an artery. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nAllergic reactions are possible. Signs of such reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, \nwheezing, drop in blood pressure (e.g. light-headedness, fainting, blurred vision), and anaphylaxis (a \nsevere reaction with a rapid onset). If these symptoms occur during surgery, the use of the medicine \nshould be stopped immediately. \n \nVeraSeal spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. \nThe spray device should not be used closer than the recommended distance.  \n\n\n\n30 \n\nSpecial safety warning \n \nFor medicines such as VeraSeal that are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are \ntaken to prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include carefully selecting blood and \nplasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and testing each donation \nand pooled plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers also include steps in the processing of \nthe blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines \nprepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot \nbe totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.  \n \nThe measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The \nmeasures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. \nParvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and for individuals \nwhose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or \nhaemolytic anaemia). \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you are treated with VeraSeal, the name and batch number \nof the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nVeraSeal is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and VeraSeal \n \nThe product may be affected after contacting solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. \nantiseptic solutions). \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before being treated with this medicine. Your doctor will decide whether you \nshould be treated with VeraSeal. \n \n \n3. How VeraSeal is used  \n \nThe use of VeraSeal is restricted to experienced surgeons who have been trained in the use of \nVeraSeal. \n \nThe surgeon will apply VeraSeal to the surface of blood vessels or to the tissue surface of internal \norgans using an application device during the course of the operation. This device allows equal \namounts of the two components of VeraSeal to be administered at the same time, and ensures that they \nmix evenly, which is important for the sealant to work at its best. \n \nThe amount of VeraSeal that will be applied depends on a number of factors, including the type of \nsurgery, the size of the area to be treated during your operation and the way VeraSeal is applied. The \nsurgeon will decide how much is appropriate, and will apply just enough to form a thin, even layer. If \nit does not seem to be enough, a second layer can be applied. \n \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nVeraSeal contains the component of fibrin sealant. Fibrin sealants may, in rare cases (up to 1 in \n1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. If you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or \nmore of the following symptoms: swelling under skin (angioedema), skin rash, hives or wheals \n(nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, heart rate increase, tingling, vomiting or wheezing. In isolated cases, these reactions may \nprogress to a severe allergic reaction. Allergic reactions may especially be seen if the preparation is \napplied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be allergic to constituents of the product. If \nyou experience any of these symptoms after surgery, you should immediately consult your doctor or \nsurgeon. \n \nThere is also a theoretical possibility that your immune system will produce proteins to attack \nVeraSeal and, that these may interfere with your blood clotting. The frequency of this type of event is \nnot known. \n \nIf this product is accidentally placed inside a blood vessel, it can lead to blood clots, including \ndisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (when blood clots form throughout the blood vessels in \nthe body). There is also a risk of a severe allergic reaction. \n \nSide effects which were reported during clinical trials with VeraSeal included:  \n \nMost serious side effects \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n- Abdominal abscess (swollen area in abdomen caused by infection) \n- Abdominal wound dehiscence (wound breakdown due to incomplete healing) \n- Leak of bile (a liquid produced by the liver) after the procedure  \n- Cellulitis (infection of the skin) \n- Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessels) \n- Liver abscess (swollen area in the liver caused by infection) \n- Peritonitis (inflammation of the wall of the abdomen) \n- Positive parvovirus B19 test (laboratory result showing infection with the virus) \n- Postoperative wound infection \n- Pulmonary embolism (blood clots in blood vessels in the lungs) \n- Wound infection \n \n \nOther side effects  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n \n- Nausea  \n- Pain caused by the surgery \n- Pruritus (itching) \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n \n- Anaemia (insufficiency of red blood cells) \n- Anxiety \n- Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) \n- Back pain \n- Bladder spasm \n- Chills \n\n\n\n32 \n\n- Conjunctival irritation (eye irritation) \n- Constipation  \n- Contusion (bruise) \n- Decreased urine output (reduced urine production) \n- Dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) \n- Dysuria (pain or difficulty in urination) \n- Ecchymosis (bruising) \n- Erythema (reddening of the skin) \n- Flatulence \n- Headache \n- High body temperature \n- High or low blood pressure \n- High or low levels of white cells in blood \n- High potassium levels in blood \n- Ileus (obstruction of the intestine) \n- Impaired coagulation of blood \n- Incision site erythema (reddening of the skin at the incision site) \n- Incision site infection \n- Increased blood bilirubin \n- Increased levels of liver enzymes \n- Increased or decreased glucose levels in blood  \n- Insomnia \n- Low blood pressure due to the procedure \n- Low calcium levels in blood \n- Low magnesium levels in blood \n- Low oxygen in blood \n- Low potassium levels in blood \n- Low protein levels in blood \n- Low red blood cell levels caused by blood loss \n- Low sodium levels in blood \n- Oedema peripheral (accumulation of fluid) \n- Pain, not specified \n- Pain at the incision site \n- Pain in extremity \n- Plasma cell myeloma (cancer of blood cells) \n- Pleural effusion (abnormal amount of fluid around the lung) \n- Pleurisy (inflammation of lungs wall) \n- Post procedural haemorrhage (bleeding after the procedure) \n- Post procedural infection (infection after the procedure) \n- Pulmonary oedema (excess of watery fluid in lungs)  \n- Retroperitoneal haematoma (accumulation of blood in the abdomen) \n- Rhonchi (rattling lung sounds) \n- Sleepiness \n- Urinary retention \n- Vascular graft complication (complication of vessel bypass) \n- Vascular graft thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessel bypass) \n- Ventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeats) \n- Vessel puncture site haematoma (bruising at site of vessel puncture) \n- Vomiting \n- Wheezing \n- Wound secretion \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or surgeon.

In clinical trials, the \nindividual dosages have typically ranged from 0.3 to 12 ml. For other procedures, larger volumes may \nbe required. \n \nThe initial volume of the product to be applied at a chosen anatomic site or target surface area should \nbe sufficient to entirely cover the intended application area. VeraSeal should be applied as a thin layer. \nThe application can be repeated, if necessary. \n \nIncompatibilities \n \nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. \n \nSpecial precautions \n \nFor epilesional use only. Do not apply intravascularly. \nLife threatening thromboembolic complications may occur if the preparation is unintentionally applied \nintravascularly. \n \nWhen using accessory tips, the instructions for use of the tips should be followed. \n \nBefore administration of VeraSeal, care must be taken that the parts of the body outside the desired \napplication area are sufficiently protected (covered) to prevent tissue adhesion at undesired sites. \n \nVeraSeal should be applied as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the \nproduct\u2019s efficacy and the wound healing process. \n \nInstructions for use \n \nRead this leaflet before you open the package. Please see pictograms at the end of this leaflet. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n36 \n\nHandling of VeraSeal \n \nVeraSeal comes ready to use in sterilized packages and must be handled using sterile technique in \naseptic conditions. Discard damaged packages as re-sterilisation is not possible. \n \nRemove carton from freezer, open it and take out the two blisters. \n \nPlace the blister containing the Dual Applicator at room temperature until the fibrin sealant is ready to \nuse. \n \n\u2022 Room temperature thawing (preferred method) \n\n \nThaw blister with VeraSeal pre-filled syringes at room temperature using the following steps: \n \n1. Place the blister containing the syringe holder with pre-filled syringes on a surface at \n\nroom temperature (20 \u00baC \u2013 25 \u00baC) \n for approximately 70 minutes for the 2 ml and the 4 ml package sizes   \n for approximately 90 minutes for the 6 ml and the 10 ml package sizes \n \n\nAfter thawing, it is not necessary to warm the product for its use. \n \n\nAfter thawing the solutions must be clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow. \nSolutions that are cloudy or have deposits should not be used. \n \nPost-Thawing Storage \n \nAfter thawing, the kit containing the VeraSeal syringe holder with pre-filled syringes and Dual \nApplicator can be stored before use for not more than 48 hours in the refrigerator at 2 \u2013 8 \u00baC or \n24 hours at room temperature (20 - 25 \u00b0C) if it remains sealed in the original packaging. Once \nthe blisters are opened, use VeraSeal immediately and discard any unused contents.  \n \nOnce thawed, do not refreeze. \n \nTransferring instructions \n \n1. After thawing, remove the blister from the surface at room temperature or from the \n\nrefrigerator at 2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C. \n2. Open the blister and make the VeraSeal syringe holder with pre-filled syringes available \n\nto a second person for transfer to the sterile field. The outside of the blister should not \ncome in contact with the sterile field. See Figure 1. \n\n \n\u2022 Sterile Water Bath (Quick Thawing)  \n\n \nThaw VeraSeal pre-filled syringes inside the sterile field in a sterile thermostatic water bath at a \ntemperature not higher than 37 \u00baC using the following steps:  \n \nNOTE: Once the VeraSeal blisters are opened, use the product immediately. Use sterile \ntechnique to avoid the possibility of contamination due to improper handling, and follow the \nsteps below accurately. Do not remove the syringe luer cap until thawing is complete and the \nDual Applicator is ready to be attached.  \n \n\n 1.  Open the blister and make the VeraSeal syringe holder with pre-filled syringes available \nto a second person for transfer to the sterile field. The outside of the blister should not \ncome in contact with the sterile field. See Figure 1. \n\n 2.  Place the syringe holder with pre-filled syringes directly into the sterile water bath \nensuring that it is completely immersed in the water. See Figure 2.   \n\n\n\n37 \n\n 3.  At 37 \u00baC, the time needed is approximately 5 minutes for the 2 ml, 4 ml, 6 ml, and 10 ml \npackage sizes, but must not be left at this temperature for longer than 10 minutes.   \nThe temperature of the water bath must not exceed 37 \u00baC. \n\n 4.  Dry the syringe holder with pre-filled syringes after thawing, using a sterile surgical \ngauze. \n\n \nAfter thawing, the solutions must be clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Do \nnot use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. \n\n \nUse VeraSeal immediately and discard any unused contents.  \n \n\n\u2022 Connection instructions \n \n1. Open the blister and make the VeraSeal Dual Applicator and two additional Airless Spray \n\nTips available to a second person for transfer to the sterile field. The outside of the blister \nshould not come in contact with the sterile field. \n\n2. Hold the VeraSeal syringe holder with syringe luer caps pointed upward. See Figure 3. \n 3. Unscrew and discard the syringe luer cap of both fibrinogen and thrombin syringes. See \n\nFigure 3.  \n4. Hold the syringe holder with the luers pointed upward. To remove air bubbles from \n\nsyringes, strike gently the side of the syringe holder one or two times while keeping the \nsyringe holder in an upright position and lightly depress the plunger to eject air. See \nFigure 4. \n\n5. Attach the Dual Applicator. See Figure 5. \n NOTE: Do not depress plunger during attachment or prior to intended use because the \n\ntwo biologic components will pre-mix in the Airless Spray Tip, forming a fibrin clot that \nprevents dispensing. See Figure 6.  \n\n6. Tighten luer locks and ensure the Dual Applicator is firmly attached. The device is now \nready to use. \n\n \n\u2022 Administration \n\n \nApply VeraSeal using the syringe holder and plunger supplied. \n \nApply VeraSeal using the Dual Applicator provided with the product. Other CE-marked \napplicator tips (including open surgery and laparoscopic use devices) intended for specific use \nwith VeraSeal may also be used. When using the provided Dual Applicator, follow the \nconnection instructions described above. When using other applicator tips, follow the \ninstructions for use that are provided with the applicator tips. \n\n \n Application by spraying \n\n \n1. Grasp and bend the Dual Applicator to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape. \n2. Position the Airless Spray Tip at least 2 cm away from the target tissue. Apply firm even \n\npressure to the plunger to spray the fibrin sealant. Increase distance accordingly to \nachieve desired coverage of the target area. \n\n3. If expression is stopped for any reason, change the Airless Spray Tip. To change the \nAirless Spray Tip, remove the device from the patient and unscrew the used Airless Spray \nTip. See Figure 7. Place the used Airless Spray Tip away from the spare Airless Spray \nTips. Wipe the end of the applicator using dry or moist sterile surgical gauze. Then, \nconnect a new Airless Spray Tip provided in the package and ensure it is firmly \nconnected before use.  \nNOTE: Red indicator will not be visible if Airless Spray Tip is properly connected. See \nFigure 8. \nNOTE: Do not continue pushing the plunger in an attempt to clear the fibrin clot within \nthe Airless Spray Tip; otherwise the applicator may become unusable. \n\n\n\n38 \n\nNOTE: Do not trim the Dual Applicator to avoid exposing internal wire. \n \n Application by dripping \n \n\n1. Remove the Airless Spray Tip portion of the spray and drip tip by unscrewing the Airless \nSpray Tip. See Figure 7.  \n\n2. Grasp and bend the drip tip to the desired position. Tip will retain its shape. \n3. During dripping, keep the end of the drip tip as close to the tissue surface as possible \n\nwithout touching the tissue during application.  \n4. Apply individual drops to the surface area to be treated. To prevent uncontrolled clotting, \n\nallow the drops to separate from each other and from the end of the drip tip.  \n NOTE: Do not reconnect a used drip tip after it has been removed from the adapter; \n\notherwise a clot may form inside the drip tip and the applicator may become unusable. \n \n\u2022 Disposal \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 1 \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 2 \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nFigure 3 \n\n \n \n\n \n Figure 4 \n\n \n \n\n \n Figure 5 \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n Figure 6 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7 \n \n \n\n \nFigure 8 \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

human thrombin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). veraseal must not be applied inside blood vessels. veraseal must not be used to treat severe or rapid bleeding from an artery. warnings and precautions allergic reactions are possible. signs of such reactions include hives, rash, tightness of the chest, wheezing, drop in blood pressure (e.g. light-headedness, fainting, blurred vision), and anaphylaxis (a severe reaction with a rapid onset). if these symptoms occur during surgery, the use of the medicine should be stopped immediately. veraseal spray application should only be used if it is possible to accurately judge the spray distance. the spray device should not be used closer than the recommended distance. special safety warning for medicines such as veraseal that are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are taken to prevent infections being passed on to patients. these include carefully selecting blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and testing each donation and pooled plasma for signs of virus/infections. manufacturers also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. this also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. the measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis a virus. the measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus b19. parvovirus b19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and for individuals whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or haemolytic anaemia). it is strongly recommended that every time you are treated with veraseal, the name and batch number of the medicine are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. children and adolescents veraseal is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. other medicines and veraseal the product may be affected after contacting solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals (e.g. antiseptic solutions). tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before being treated with this medicine. your doctor will decide whether you

"Section_4": {"Title": "4. possible side effects", "Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. veraseal contains the component of fibrin sealant. fibrin sealants may, in rare cases (up to 1 in 1,000 people), cause an allergic reaction. if you experience an allergic reaction you might have one or more of the following symptoms: swelling under skin (angioedema), skin rash, hives or wheals (nettle-rash), tightness of the chest, chills, flushing, headache, low blood pressure, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, heart rate increase, tingling, vomiting or wheezing. in isolated cases, these reactions may progress to a severe allergic reaction. allergic reactions may especially be seen if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be allergic to constituents of the product. if you experience any of these symptoms after surgery, you should immediately consult your doctor or surgeon. there is also a theoretical possibility that your immune system will produce proteins to attack veraseal and, that these may interfere with your blood clotting. the frequency of this type of event is not known. if this product is accidentally placed inside a blood vessel, it can lead to blood clots, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) (when blood clots form throughout the blood vessels in the body). there is also a risk of a severe allergic reaction. side effects which were reported during clinical trials with veraseal included: most serious side effects uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - abdominal abscess (swollen area in abdomen caused by infection) - abdominal wound dehiscence (wound breakdown due to incomplete healing) - leak of bile (a liquid produced by the liver) after the procedure - cellulitis (infection of the skin) - deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessels) - liver abscess (swollen area in the liver caused by infection) - peritonitis (inflammation of the wall of the abdomen) - positive parvovirus b19 test (laboratory result showing infection with the virus) - postoperative wound infection - pulmonary embolism (blood clots in blood vessels in the lungs) - wound infection other side effects common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): - nausea - pain caused by the surgery - pruritus (itching) uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): - anaemia (insufficiency of red blood cells) - anxiety - atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) - back pain - bladder spasm - chills 32 - conjunctival irritation (eye irritation) - constipation - contusion (bruise) - decreased urine output (reduced urine production) - dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) - dysuria (pain or difficulty in urination) - ecchymosis (bruising) - erythema (reddening of the skin) - flatulence - headache - high body temperature - high or low blood pressure - high or low levels of white cells in blood - high potassium levels in blood - ileus (obstruction of the intestine) - impaired coagulation of blood - incision site erythema (reddening of the skin at the incision site) - incision site infection - increased blood bilirubin - increased levels of liver enzymes - increased or decreased glucose levels in blood - insomnia - low blood pressure due to the procedure - low calcium levels in blood - low magnesium levels in blood - low oxygen in blood - low potassium levels in blood - low protein levels in blood - low red blood cell levels caused by blood loss - low sodium levels in blood - oedema peripheral (accumulation of fluid) - pain, not specified - pain at the incision site - pain in extremity - plasma cell myeloma (cancer of blood cells) - pleural effusion (abnormal amount of fluid around the lung) - pleurisy (inflammation of lungs wall) - post procedural haemorrhage (bleeding after the procedure) - post procedural infection (infection after the procedure) - pulmonary oedema (excess of watery fluid in lungs) - retroperitoneal haematoma (accumulation of blood in the abdomen) - rhonchi (rattling lung sounds) - sleepiness - urinary retention - vascular graft complication (complication of vessel bypass) - vascular graft thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessel bypass) - ventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeats) - vessel puncture site haematoma (bruising at site of vessel puncture) - vomiting - wheezing - wound secretion reporting of side effects if you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or surgeon. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.",
