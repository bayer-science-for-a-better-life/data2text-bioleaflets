CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nDarunavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other \n\nantiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus \n\n(HIV-1) infection (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose \n\nregimens (see section 4.2): \n\n\u25cf For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult \n\npatients, including those that have been highly pre-treated. \n\n\u25cf For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least \n\n15 kg body weight. \n\n \n\nIn deciding to initiate treatment with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful \n\nconsideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of \n\nmutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and \n\ntreatment history should guide the use of darunavir (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a health care provider experienced in the management of HIV \n\ninfection. After therapy with darunavir has been initiated, patients should be advised not to alter the \n\ndosage, dose form or discontinue therapy without discussing with their health care provider. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan must always be given orally with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer \n\nand in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of ritonavir must, therefore, be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with darunavir. \n\n \n\nART-experienced adult patients \n\nThe recommended dose regimen is 600 mg twice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken \n\nwith food. Darunavir Mylan 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg tablets can be used to construct the \n\ntwice daily 600 mg regimen. \n\n \n\nThe use of 75 mg and 150 mg tablets to achieve the recommended dose is appropriate when there is \n\na difficulty in swallowing the 300 mg or 600 mg tablets. Before prescribing darunavir tablets, young \n\nchildren should be assessed for the ability to swallow intact tablets. For young children unable to \n\nswallow tablets, more suitable formulations containing darunavir should be checked for their \n\navailability. \n\n \n\nART-na\u00efve adult patients \n\nFor dosage recommendations in ART-na\u00efve patients see the Summary of Product Characteristics for \n\ndarunavir 400 mg and 800 mg tablets. \n\n \n\nART-na\u00efve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) \n\nThe weight-based dose of darunavir and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below. \n\n \n\nRecommended dose for treatment-na\u00efve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years) with darunavir \n\ntablets and ritonavira \n\nBody weight (kg) Dose (once daily with food) \n\n\u2265 15 kg to < 30 kg 600 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir once daily \n\n\u2265 30 kg to < 40 kg 675 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir once daily \n\n\u2265 40 kg 800 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir once daily \na ritonavir oral solution: 80 mg/ml \n\n \n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg) \n\nDarunavir twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended. \n\n \n\nA once daily dose regimen of darunavir taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients \n\nwith prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nmutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell \n\ncount \u2265 100 cells x 106/l. \n\n*   DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V \n\n \n\nThe weight-based dose of darunavir and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below. \n\nThe recommended dose of darunavir with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the recommended adult \n\ndose (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily). \n\n \n\nRecommended dose for treatment-experienced paediatric patients \n\n(3 to 17 years) with darunavir tablets and ritonavira \n\nBody weight (kg) Dose (once daily with food) Dose (twice daily with food) \n\n\u2265 15 kg\u2013< 30 kg 600 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir \n\nonce daily \n\n375 mg darunavir/50 mg ritonavir \n\ntwice daily \n\n\u2265 30 kg\u2013< 40 kg 675 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir \n\nonce daily \n\n450 mg darunavir/60 mg ritonavir \n\ntwice daily \n\n\u2265 40 kg 800 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir \n\nonce daily \n\n600 mg darunavir/100 mg ritonavir \n\ntwice daily \na ritonavir oral solution: 80 mg/ml \n\n \n\nFor ART-experienced paediatric patients HIV genotypic testing is recommended. However, when \n\nHIV genotypic testing is not feasible, the darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing regimen is \n\nrecommended in HIV protease inhibitor-na\u00efve paediatric patients and the twice daily dosing regimen \n\nis recommended in HIV protease inhibitor-experienced patients. \n\n \n\nAdvice on missed doses \n\nIn case a dose of darunavir and/or ritonavir is missed within 6 hours of the time it is usually taken, \n\npatients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of darunavir and ritonavir with food as soon \n\nas possible. If this is noticed later than 6 hours after the time it is usually taken, the missed dose \n\nshould not be taken and the patient should resume the usual dosing schedule. \n\n \n\nThis guidance is based on the 15 hour half-life of darunavir in the presence of ritonavir and the \n\nrecommended dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nLimited information is available in this population, and therefore, darunavir should be used with \n\ncaution in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDarunavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \n\nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, darunavir \n\nshould be used with caution in these patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with \n\nsevere hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment could result in an increase of darunavir \n\nexposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, darunavir must not be used in patients with \n\nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nDarunavir/ritonavir should not be used in children with a body weight of less than 15 kg as the dose \n\nfor this population has not been established in a sufficient number of patients (see section 5.1). \n\nDarunavir/ritonavir should not be used in children below 3 years of age because of safety concerns \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nThe weight-based dose regimen for darunavir and ritonavir is provided in the tables above.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and postpartum \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \n\nDarunavir/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential \n\nrisk (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to take Darunavir Mylan with low dose ritonavir within 30 minutes after \n\ncompletion of a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to darunavir (see sections 4.4, 4.5 \n\nand 5.2). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. \n\n \n\nCombination of rifampicin with darunavir with concomitant low dose ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCo-administration with the combination product lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nCo-administration with herbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see \n\nsection 4.5). \n\n \n\nCo-administration of darunavir with low dose ritonavir, with active substances that are highly \n\ndependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with \n\nserious and/or life-threatening events. These active substances include e.g.: \n\n- alfuzosin  \n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine \n- astemizole, terfenadine  \n- colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5) \n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) \n- elbasvir/grazoprevir \n- cisapride \n- dapoxetine \n- domperidone \n- naloxegol \n- lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (see section 4.5) \n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \n\nsee section 4.5) \n\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil  \n- simvastatin, lovastatin and lomitapide (see section 4.5) \n- dabigatran, ticagrelor (see section 4.5). \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \n\nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \n\nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n\n \n\nRegular assessment of virological response is advised. In the setting of lack or loss of virological \n\nresponse, resistance testing should be performed. \n\n \n\nDarunavir must always be given orally with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and in \n\ncombination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 5.2). The Summary of Product \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nCharacteristics of ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy \n\nwith darunavir.  \n\n \n\nIncreasing the dose of ritonavir from that recommended in section 4.2 did not significantly affect \n\ndarunavir concentrations. It is not recommended to alter the dose of ritonavir. \n\n \n\nDarunavir binds predominantly to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. This protein binding is concentration-\n\ndependent indicative for saturation of binding. Therefore, protein displacement of medicinal products \n\nhighly bound to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein cannot be ruled out (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nART-experienced patients - once daily dosing \n\n \n\nDarunavir used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced \n\npatients should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations \n\n(DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA \u2265 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section \n\n4.2). Combinations with optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than \u2265 2 NRTIs have not been \n\nstudied in this population. Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not recommended for use in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg \n\nbody weight (see sections 4.2 and 5.3). \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nDarunavir/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential \n\nrisk. Caution should be used in pregnant women with concomitant medications which may further \n\ndecrease darunavir exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nAs limited information is available on the use of darunavir in patients aged 65 and over, caution should \n\nbe exercised in the administration of darunavir in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of \n\ndecreased hepatic function and of concomitant disease or other therapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nSevere skin reactions \n\n \n\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), severe skin reactions, which \n\nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \n\npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Darunavir should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include, \n\nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or \n\njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. \n\n \n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \n\ndarunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir \n\nor raltegravir without darunavir (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. Darunavir Mylan should be used with caution in patients \n\nwith a known sulphonamide allergy. \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with darunavir. \n\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in \n\n0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with darunavir/ritonavir. Patients with \n\npre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for \n\nliver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \n\nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for \n\nthese medicinal products. \n\n \n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with darunavir/ritonavir \n\nand patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be \n\nconsidered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-\n\ntreatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of \n\ndarunavir/ritonavir treatment. \n\n \n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation \n\nof liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \n\ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using darunavir/ritonavir, interruption or discontinuation of \n\ntreatment should be considered promptly. \n\n \n\nPatients with coexisting conditions  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy of darunavir have not been established in patients with severe underlying \n\nliver disorders and darunavir is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n\nDue to an increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, darunavir should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo special precautions or dose adjustments for darunavir/ritonavir are required in patients with renal \n\nimpairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they \n\nwill be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special \n\nprecautions or dose adjustments are required in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nHaemophiliac patients \n\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \n\nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \n\nfactor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \n\nreintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although \n\nthe mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made \n\naware of the possibility of increased bleeding. \n\n \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \n\ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \n\nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \n\nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \n\nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\n \n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \n\nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \n\nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \n\njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. \n\n \n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \n\npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \n\nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \n\nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \n\npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \n\ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, \n\nreactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical studies with darunavir \n\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir. \n\n \n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \n\noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \n\nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nInteractions with medicinal products \n\n \n\nSeveral of the interaction studies have been performed with darunavir at lower than recommended \n\ndoses. The effects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical \n\nmonitoring of safety may be indicated. For full information on interactions with other medicinal \n\nproducts see section 4.5. \n\n \n\nEfavirenz in combination with boosted darunavir once daily may result in sub-optimal darunavir Cmin. \n\nIf efavirenz is to be used in combination with darunavir, the darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \n\ndaily regimen should be used (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \n\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; see sections 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains sodium \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg film-coated tablets contain less than 1 mmol \n\nsodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir \n\nDarunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of darunavir/ \n\nritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or transported by \n\nP-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or \n\nprolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nDarunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that \n\nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated \n\nwith serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThe overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in \n\nthe systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in \n\ncombination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in \n\ncombination with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nA clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and \n\ninhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the \n\npresence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nwhich are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result \n\nin increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their \n\ntherapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal \n\nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) \n\nmay result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or \n\nshorten their therapeutic effect. \n\n \n\nAlthough the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and \n\nritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, \n\nrepaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could \n\ndecrease or shorten their therapeutic effect. \n\n \n\nRitonavir inhibits the transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co-administration \n\nwith substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds \n\n(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below). \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir/ritonavir exposure \n\nDarunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \n\nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma \n\nconcentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e.g. rifampicin, St John\u2019s wort, lopinavir). \n\nCo-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may \n\ndecrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of \n\ndarunavir and ritonavir (e.g. indinavir, azole antifungals like clotrimazole). These interactions are \n\ndescribed in the interaction table below. \n\n \n\nInteraction table \n\nInteractions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products \n\nare listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on \n\nthe 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (\u2194), below (\u2193) or above (\u2191) the \n\n80-125% range (not determined as \u201cND\u201d). \n\n \n\nSeveral of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than \n\nrecommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The \n\neffects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of \n\nsafety may be indicated. \n\n \n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \n\neach drug that is co-administered with darunavir should be consulted for information related to the \n\nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards \n\nto co-administration. \n\n \nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS \n\nMedicinal products by \n\ntherapeutic areas \n\nInteraction Geometric mean change \n\n(%) \n\nRecommendations concerning co-\n\nadministration \n\nHIV ANTIRETROVIRALS \n\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors \n\nDolutegravir dolutegravir AUC \u2193 22% \n\ndolutegravir C24h  \u2193 38%  \n\ndolutegravir Cmax \u2193 11% \n\ndarunavir \u2194* \n\n* Using cross-study comparisons to \n\nhistorical pharmacokinetic data \n\nDarunavir co-administered with \n\nlow dose ritonavir and dolutegravir \n\ncan be used without dose \n\nadjustment. \n\nRaltegravir Some clinical studies suggest \n\nraltegravir may cause a modest \n\ndecrease in darunavir plasma \n\nconcentrations. \n\nAt present the effect of raltegravir \n\non darunavir plasma \n\nconcentrations does not appear to \n\nbe clinically relevant.

There was no effect on mating or \n\nfertility with darunavir treatment in rats (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nDarunavir in combination with ritonavir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use \n\nmachines. However, dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens \n\ncontaining darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir and should be borne in mind when \n\nconsidering a patient\u2019s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nDuring the clinical development program (N=2,613 treatment-experienced subjects who initiated \n\ntherapy with darunavir/ ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily), 51.3% of subjects experienced at least one \n\nadverse reaction. The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent \n\nadverse reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, \n\nheadache and vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial \n\ninfarction, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, \n\ndiarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia. \n\n \n\nIn the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of darunavir/ ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-\n\nna\u00efve subjects was similar to that seen with darunavir/ ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in treatment-\n\nexperienced subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in treatment-na\u00efve \n\nsubjects. This was driven by mild intensity nausea. No new safety findings were identified in the \n\n192 week analysis of the treatment-na\u00efve subjects in which the mean treatment duration of darunavir/ \n\nritonavir 800/100 mg once daily was 162.5 weeks. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency category. Within each \n\nfrequency category, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency \n\ncategories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon \n\n(\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not known

first four weeks of \n\ntreatment and resolving with continued dosing. In cases of severe skin reaction see the warning in \n\nsection 4.4. \n\n \n\nDuring the clinical development program of raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients, rash, \n\nirrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing darunavir/ritonavir \n\n+ raltegravir compared to those containing darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir \n\nwithout darunavir/ritonavir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar \n\nrates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years \n\n(PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 per 100 PYR, respectively. The \n\nrashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMetabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities \n\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of \n\nprotease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs. \n\n \n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \n\nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The \n\nfrequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \n\ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \n\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \n\nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients \n\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \n\nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the 48-week analysis of safety data from three \n\nPhase II trials. The following patient populations were evaluated (see section 5.1): \n\n\u25cf 80 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 6 to 17 years and weighing at \n\nleast 20 kg who received darunavir tablets with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination \n\nwith other antiretroviral agents. \n\n\u25cf 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 3 to < 6 years and weighing \n\n10 kg to < 20 kg (16 participants from 15 kg to < 20 kg) who received darunavir oral suspension \n\nwith low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n\n\u25cf 12 ART-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 12 to 17 years and weighing at least \n\n40 kg who received darunavir tablets with low dose ritonavir once daily in combination with \n\nother antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nOverall, the safety profile in these paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult \n\npopulation. \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nAmong 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving darunavir co-administered with ritonavir \n\n600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were \n\nmore likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those \n\nwithout chronic viral hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir is \n\nlimited. Single doses up to 3,200 mg of darunavir as oral solution alone and up to 1,600 mg of the \n\ntablet formulation of darunavir in combination with ritonavir have been administered to healthy \n\nvolunteers without untoward symptomatic effects. \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with darunavir. Treatment of overdose with darunavir \n\nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \n\nclinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \n\nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE10. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease (KD of \n\n4.5 x 10-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \n\ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles. \n\n \n\nAntiviral activity in vitro \n\n \n\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \n\nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human \n\nmonocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to 5.0 ng/ml). \n\nDarunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (A, B, C, D, \n\nE, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM. \n\n \n\nThese EC50 values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 \u00b5M to > \n\n100 \u00b5M. \n\n \n\nResistance \n\n \n\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). \n\nThe selected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above \n\n400 nM. \n\nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n\n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \n\nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \n\nby the emergence of these protease mutations. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe clinical trial data from ART-experienced patients (TITAN trial and the pooled analysis of the \n\nPOWER 1, 2 and 3 and DUET 1 and 2 trials) showed that virologic response to darunavir co-\n\nadministered with low dose ritonavir was decreased when 3 or more darunavir RAMs (V11I, V32I, \n\nL33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V) were present at baseline or when these \n\nmutations developed during treatment. \n\n \n\nIncreasing baseline darunavir fold change in EC50 (FC) was associated with decreasing virologic \n\nresponse. A lower and upper clinical cut-off of 10 and 40 were identified. Isolates with baseline \n\nFC \u2264 10 are susceptible; isolates with FC > 10 to 40 have decreased susceptibility; isolates with \n\nFC > 40 are resistant (see Clinical results). \n\n \n\nViruses isolated from patients on darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily experiencing \n\nvirologic failure by rebound that were susceptible to tipranavir at baseline remained susceptible \n\nto tipranavir after treatment in the vast majority of cases. \n\n \n\nThe lowest rates of developing resistant HIV virus are observed in ART-na\u00efve patients who are \n\ntreated for the first time with darunavir in combination with other ART. \n\n \n\nThe table below shows the development of HIV 1 protease mutations and loss of susceptibility \n\nto PIs in virologic failures at endpoint in the ARTEMIS, ODIN and TITAN trials. \n\n \n\n ARTEMIS \nWeek 192 \n\nODIN \nWeek 48 \n\nTITAN \nWeek 48 \n\n Darunavir/ \nritonavir \n\n800/100 mg \n\nonce daily  \n\nN=343 \n\nDarunavir/ \nritonavir \n\n800/100 mg once \n\ndaily  \n\nN=294 \n\nDarunavir/ ritonavir \n\n600/100 mg twice \n\ndaily N=296 \n\nDarunavir/ \nritonavir \n\n600/100 mg \n\ntwice daily  \n\nN=298 \n\nTotal number of virologic \nfailuresa, n (%) \n\nRebounders \n\nNever suppressed \n\nsubjects \n\n \n55 (16.0%) \n\n \n\n39 (11.4%) \n\n16 (4.7%) \n\n \n65 (22.1%) \n\n \n\n11 (3.7%) \n\n54 (18.4%) \n\n \n54 (18.2%) \n\n \n\n11 (3.7%) \n\n43 (14.5%) \n\n \n31 (10.4%) \n\n \n\n16 (5.4%) \n\n15 (5.0%) \n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint genotypes, developing mutationsb at \nendpoint, n/N \n\nPrimary (major) PI \n\nMutations \n\n0/43 1/60 0/42 6/28 \n\nPI RAMs 4/43 7/60 4/42 10/28 \n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint phenotypes, showing loss of \n\nsusceptibility to PIs at endpoint compared to baseline, n/N \n\nPI \n\ndarunavir  \n\namprenavir  \n\natazanavir  \n\nindinavir  \n\nlopinavir  \n\nsaquinavir  \n\ntipranavir \n\n \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n \n\n1/58 \n\n1/58 \n\n2/56 \n\n2/57 \n1/58 \n\n0/56 \n\n0/58 \n\n \n\n0/41 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/41 \n\n \n\n3/26 \n\n0/22 \n\n0/22 \n\n1/24 \n0/23 \n\n0/22 \n\n1/25 \na TLOVR non-VF censored algorithm based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml, except for TITAN (HIV-1 RNA < \n\n400 copies/ml) \nb IAS-USA lists \n\n \n\nCross-resistance \n\n \n\nDarunavir FC was less than 10 for 90% of 3,309 clinical isolates resistant to amprenavir, atazanavir, \n\nindinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and/or tipranavir showing that viruses resistant to \n\nmost PIs remain susceptible to darunavir. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nIn the virologic failures of the ARTEMIS trial no cross-resistance with other PIs was observed.  \n\n \n\nClinical results \n\n \n\nAdult patients \n\nFor clinical trial results in ART-na\u00efve adult patients, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics \n\nfor darunavir 400 mg and 800 mg tablets. \n\n \n\nEfficacy of darunavir 600 mg twice daily co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in ART-\n\nexperienced patients \n\n \n\nThe evidence of efficacy of darunavir co-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) in \n\nART-experienced patients is based on the 96 weeks analysis of the Phase III trial TITAN in \n\nART-experienced lopinavir na\u00efve patients, on the 48 week analysis of the Phase III trial ODIN in \n\nART-experienced patients with no DRV-RAMs, and on the analyses of 96 weeks data from the Phase \n\nIIb trials POWER 1 and 2 in ART-experienced patients with high level of PI resistance. \n\n \n\nTITAN is a randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial comparing darunavir co-administered \n\nwith ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) versus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) in ART-\n\nexperienced, lopinavir na\u00efve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

Virologic response was preserved throughout the \n\nstudy period in both arms. No mother to child transmission occurred in the infants born to the \n\n31 subjects who stayed on the antiretroviral treatment through delivery. There were no new clinically \n\nrelevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1 \n\ninfected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with ritonavir, have been evaluated in \n\nhealthy adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher in HIV-1 \n\ninfected patients than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 infected \n\npatients compared to healthy subjects may be explained by the higher concentrations of \u03b11-acid \n\nglycoprotein (AAG) in HIV-1 infected patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to plasma AAG \n\nand, therefore, higher plasma concentrations. \n\n \n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby increasing the \n\nplasma concentrations of darunavir considerably. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nDarunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration of \n\ndarunavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is generally achieved within 2.5-4.0 hours. \n\n \n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% \n\nand increased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The overall \n\npharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic \n\nexposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with \n\nritonavir at 100 mg twice daily (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nWhen administered without food, the relative bioavailability of darunavir in the presence of low dose \n\nritonavir is 30% lower as compared to intake with food. Therefore, darunavir tablets should be taken \n\nwith ritonavir and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to darunavir. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma \u03b11-acid \n\nglycoprotein. \n\n \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 \u00b1 59.0 l \n\n(Mean \u00b1 SD) and increased to 131 \u00b1 49.9 l (Mean \u00b1 SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \n\nritonavir. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily undergoes \n\noxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and almost \n\nexclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A 14C-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a majority of \n\nthe radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due to the \n\nparent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in humans; \n\nall showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild type HIV. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \n\nadministered dose of 14C-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \n\ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \n\nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of darunavir was approximately 15 hours when \n\ncombined with ritonavir. \n\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose ritonavir was \n\n32.8 l/h and 5.9 l/h, respectively. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in 74 treatment-\n\nexperienced paediatric patients, aged 6 to 17 years and weighing at least 20 kg, showed that the \n\nadministered weight-based doses of darunavir/ritonavir resulted in darunavir exposure comparable to \n\nthat in adults receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in 14 treatment-\n\nexperienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 15 kg to < 20 kg, showed that \n\nweight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in adults \n\nreceiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 12 ART-na\u00efve \n\npaediatric patients, aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg, showed that darunavir/ritonavir \n\n800/100 mg once daily results in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in adults \n\nreceiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily. Therefore the same once daily dosage may be \n\nused in treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg without \n\ndarunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 \n\ncopies/ml and CD4+ cell count \u2265 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2). \n*   DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 10 treatment-\n\nexperienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to < 20 kg, showed \n\nthat weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in \n\nadults receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, \n\npharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages \n\nof 3 to < 18 years confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed \n\nthe identification of weight-based darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric \n\npatients weighing at least 15 kg that are either ART-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced paediatric patients \n\nwithout DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \n\n\u2265 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2). \n\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics \n\nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients \n\n(n=12, age \u2265 65) (see section 4.4). However, only limited data were available in patients above the age \n\nof 65 year. \n\n \n\nGender \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV \n\ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nResults from a mass balance study with 14C-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately 7.7% \n\nof the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged. \n\n \n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly \n\naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose study with darunavir \n\nco-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total plasma \n\nconcentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate (Child-\n\nPugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. However, \n\nunbound darunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and 100% (Child-\n\nPugh Class B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown therefore, \n\ndarunavir should be used with caution. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the \n\npharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nPregnancy and postpartum \n\nThe exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \n\ndaily and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally \n\nlower during pregnancy compared with postpartum. However, for unbound (i.e. active) darunavir, the \n\npharmacokinetic parameters were less reduced during pregnancy compared to postpartum, due to an \n\nincrease in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum. \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n\n600/100 mg twice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum \n\nPharmacokinetics of \n\ntotal darunavir \n\n(mean \u00b1 SD) \n\nSecond trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=12)a \n\nThird trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=12) \n\nPostpartum  \n\n(6-12 weeks) \n\n(n=12) \n\nCmax, ng/ml 4,668 \u00b1 1,097 5,328 \u00b1 1,631 6,659 \u00b1 2,364 \n\nAUC12h, ng.h/ml 39,370 \u00b1 9,597 45,880 \u00b1 17,360 56,890 \u00b1 26,340 \n\nCmin, ng/ml 1,922 \u00b1 825 2,661 \u00b1 1,269 2,851 \u00b1 2,216 \na n=11 for AUC12h \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at \n\n800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum \n\nPharmacokinetics of \n\ntotal darunavir \n\n(mean \u00b1 SD) \n\nSecond trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=17) \n\nThird Trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=15) \n\nPostpartum  \n\n(6-12 weeks) \n\n(n=16) \n\nCmax, ng/ml 4,964 \u00b1 1,505 5,132 \u00b1 1,198 7,310 \u00b1 1,704 \n\nAUC24h, ng.h/ml 62,289 \u00b1 16,234 61,112 \u00b1 13,790 92,116 \u00b1 29,241 \n\nCmin, ng/ml 1,248 \u00b1 542 1,075 \u00b1 594 1,473 \u00b1 1,141 \n\n \n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were 28%, 26% and \n\n26% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \n\ndarunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin values were 18%, 16% lower and 2% higher, respectively, as \n\ncompared with postpartum. \n\n \n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 33%, 31% and \n\n30% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \n\ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 29%, 32% and 50% lower, respectively, as compared \n\nwith postpartum. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted at exposures up to clinical exposure levels with \n\ndarunavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs and in combination with ritonavir in rats and dogs. \n\n \n\nIn repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment \n\nwith darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood \n\ncoagulation system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related \n\nparameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time. \n\n \n\nChanges were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and \n\nthyroid (follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small \n\nincrease in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the \n\npancreas (in male rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity \n\nfindings or target organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the \n\nrecommended dose. \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the \n\npresence of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\ntreatment up to 1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the \n\nclinically recommended dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in \n\nrats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The \n\nexposure levels were lower than those with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and \n\npostnatal development assessment in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient \n\nreduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening \n\nof eyes and ears. Darunavir in combination with ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups \n\nthat exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation and a reduced pup survival during lactation. \n\nThese effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active substance via the milk and/or maternal \n\ntoxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir alone or in combination with \n\nritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased mortality was observed with \n\nconvulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was considerably higher than in \n\nadult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After day 23 of life, the \n\nexposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least partly due to \n\nimmaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related mortalities \n\nwere noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at \n\n500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were \n\ncomparable to those observed in adult rats. \n\n \n\nDue to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver \n\nenzymes, darunavir with low dose ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of \n\nage. \n\n \n\nDarunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \n\nto 104 weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50, \n\n150 and 500 mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of \n\nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid \n\nfollicular cell adenomas were noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a \n\nstatistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or \n\nrats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in rodents are considered to be of limited \n\nrelevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats caused hepatic microsomal enzyme \n\ninduction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose rats, but not humans, to \n\nthyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on AUC) to darunavir \n\nwere between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans \n\nat the recommended therapeutic doses. \n\n \n\nAfter 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney changes \n\nwere observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy). \n\n \n\nDarunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including bacterial \n\nreverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo micronucleus \n\ntest in mice. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nDarunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral \n\nmedicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) \n\ninfection.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral \n\nmedicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult \n\npatients (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan 400 mg and 800 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the \n\ntreatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 40 kg \n\nbody weight who are:  \n\n\u25cf antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na\u00efve (see section 4.2).  \n\n\u25cf ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who \n\nhave plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \u2265 100 cells x 106/l. In \n\ndeciding to initiate treatment with darunavir in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic \n\ntesting should guide the use of darunavir (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).  \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTherapy should be initiated by a health care provider experienced in the management of HIV \n\ninfection. After therapy with darunavir has been initiated, patients should be advised not to alter the \n\ndosage, dose form or discontinue therapy without discussing with their health care provider.  \n\n \n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different contraindications and \n\nrecommendations for concomitant medications depending on whether the compound is boosted with \n\nritonavir or cobicistat (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\n \n\nDarunavir must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic \n\nenhancer and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation \n\nof therapy with darunavir. Cobicistat is not indicated for use in twice daily regimens or for use in the \n\npaediatric population.  \n\n \n\nART-na\u00efve adult patients \n\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir \n\n100 mg once daily taken with food. Darunavir 400 mg and 800 mg tablets can be used to construct the \n\nonce daily 800 mg regimen.  \n\n \n\nART-experienced adult patients \n\nThe recommended dose regimens are as follows:  \n\n\u25cf In ART-experienced patients with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* \n\nand who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \u2265 100 cells x 106/l \n\n(see section 4.1) a regimen of 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir \n\n100 mg once daily taken with food may be used. Darunavir 400 mg and 800 mg tablets can be \n\nused to construct the once daily 800 mg regimen.  \n\n\u25cf In all other ART-experienced patients or if HIV-1 genotype testing is not available, the \n\nrecommended dose regimen is 600 mg twice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken \n\nwith food. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for darunavir 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or \n\n600 mg tablets.  \n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V  \n\n \n\nART-na\u00efve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) \n\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with \n\nfood. The dose of cobicistat to be used with darunavir in children less than 18 years of age has not \n\nbeen established.  \n\n \n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) \n\nThe dose of cobicistat to be used with darunavir in children less than 18 years of age has not been \n\nestablished.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose regimens are as follows:  \n\n\u25cf In ART-experienced patients without DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA \n\n< 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \u2265 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.1) a regimen of \n\n800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with food may be used. Darunavir \n\n400 mg and 800 mg tablets can be used to construct the once daily 800 mg regimen.  \n\n\u25cf In all other ART-experienced patients or if HIV-1 genotype testing is not available, the \n\nrecommended dose regimen described in the Summary of Product Characteristics for darunavir \n\n75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg tablets.  \n*   DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V  \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nAdvice on missed doses \n\nIf a once daily dose of darunavir and/or cobicistat or ritonavir is missed within 12 hours of the time it \n\nis usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of darunavir and cobicistat or \n\nritonavir with food as soon as possible. If this is noticed later than 12 hours after the time it is usually \n\ntaken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should resume the usual dosing schedule.  \n\n \n\nThis guidance is based on the half-life of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat or ritonavir and the \n\nrecommended dosing interval of approximately 24 hours.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nLimited information is available in this population, and therefore, darunavir should be used with \n\ncaution in this age group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDarunavir is metabolised by the hepatic system. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with \n\nmild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, however, darunavir \n\nshould be used with caution in these patients. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with \n\nsevere hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment could result in an increase of darunavir \n\nexposure and a worsening of its safety profile. Therefore, darunavir must not be used in patients with \n\nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment (see sections \n\n4.4 and 5.2). Cobicistat has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and, therefore, no \n\nrecommendation can be made for the use of darunavir/cobicistat in these patients.  \n\n \n\nCobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in serum \n\ncreatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance. Hence, the use of creatinine clearance as an \n\nestimate of renal elimination capacity may be misleading. Cobicistat as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of \n\ndarunavir should, therefore, not be initiated in patients with creatine clearance less than 70 ml/min if \n\nany co-administered agent requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance: e.g. emtricitabine, \n\nlamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate, phosphate or succinate) or adefovir dipovoxil.  \n\nFor information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nDarunavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg body \n\nweight (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).  \n\n \n\nART-na\u00efve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) \n\nThe recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with \n\nfood. \n\n \n\nART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) \n\nIn ART-experienced patients without DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA  \n\n< 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \u2265 100 cells x 106/l, a regimen of 800 mg once daily with \n\nritonavir 100 mg once daily taken with food may be used.  \n\n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V \n\n \n\nFor dosage recommendations in children, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for darunavir \n\n75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg tablets. \n\n \n\nThe dose of cobicistat to be used with Darunavir has not been established in this patient population. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and postpartum \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and postpartum. \n\nDarunavir/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential \n\nrisk (see sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg during pregnancy results in low darunavir exposure \n\n(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Therefore, therapy with Darunavir/cobicistat should not be initiated during \n\npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with Darunavir/cobicistat should be \n\nswitched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). Darunavir/ritonavir may be considered as \n\nan alternative.  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to take Darunavir Mylan with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir within \n\n30 minutes after completion of a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to darunavir (see \n\nsections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\nPatients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.  \n\n \n\nConcomitant treatment with any of the following medicinal products given the expected decrease in \n\nplasma concentrations of darunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat and the potential for loss of therapeutic \n\neffect (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nApplicable to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat:  \n\n- The combination product lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5).  \n- The strong CYP3A inducers rifampicin and herbal preparations containing St John's wort \n\n(Hypericum perforatum). Co-administration is expected to reduce plasma concentrations of \n\ndarunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat, which could lead to loss of therapeutic effect and possible \n\ndevelopment of resistance (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nApplicable to darunavir boosted with cobicistat, not when boosted with ritonavir:  \n\n- Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction than darunavir \nboosted with ritonavir. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated, since \n\nthese may reduce the exposure to cobicistat and darunavir leading to loss of therapeutic effect. \n\nStrong CYP3A inducers include e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (see sections \n\n4.4 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nDarunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat inhibits the elimination of active substances that \n\nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, which results in increased exposure to the co-\n\nadministered medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products for \n\nwhich elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is \n\ncontraindicated (applies to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). These active \n\nsubstances include e.g.:  \n\n- alfuzosin  \n- amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, ranolazine  \n- astemizole, terfenadine  \n- colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5)  \n- ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine)  \n- elbasvir/grazoprevir  \n- cisapride \n- dapoxetine \n- domperidone \n- naloxegol \n- lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (see section 4.5)  \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n- triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, \nsee section 4.5)  \n\n- sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil  \n- simvastatin, lovastatin and lomitapide (see section 4.5)  \n- dabigatran, ticagrelor (see section 4.5).  \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \n\nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission \n\nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines.  \n\n \n\nRegular assessment of virological response is advised. In the setting of lack or loss of virological \n\nresponse, resistance testing should be performed.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir 400 mg or 800 mg must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section \n\n5.2). The Summary of Product Characteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore \n\nbe consulted prior to initiation of therapy with darunavir.  \n\n \n\nIncreasing the dose of ritonavir from that recommended in section 4.2 did not significantly affect \n\ndarunavir concentrations. It is not recommended to alter the dose of cobicistat or ritonavir.  \n\nDarunavir binds predominantly to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. This protein binding is concentration-\n\ndependent indicative for saturation of binding. Therefore, protein displacement of medicinal products \n\nhighly bound to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein cannot be ruled out (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\nART-experienced patients \u2013 once daily dosing \n\n \n\nDarunavir used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced \n\npatients should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations \n\n(DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA \u2265 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section \n\n4.2). Combinations with optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than \u2265 2 NRTIs have not been \n\nstudied in this population. Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see \n\nsection 5.1).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not recommended for use in paediatric patients below 3 years of age or less than 15 kg \n\nbody weight (see sections 4.2 and 5.3).  \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nDarunavir/ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential \n\nrisk. Caution should be used in pregnant women with concomitant medications which may further \n\ndecrease darunavir exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n\n \n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during the second and third trimester has \n\nbeen shown to result in low darunavir exposure, with a reduction of around 90% in Cmin levels (see \n\nsection 5.2). Cobicistat levels decrease and may not provide sufficient boosting. The substantial \n\nreduction in darunavir exposure may result in virological failure and an increased risk of mother to \n\nchild transmission of HIV infection. Therefore, therapy with Darunavir/cobicistat should not be \n\ninitiated during pregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with  \n\nDarunavir/cobicistat should be switched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.6). \n\nDarunavir given with low dose ritonavir may be considered as an alternative.  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nAs limited information is available on the use of darunavir in patients aged 65 and over, caution \n\nshould be exercised in the administration of darunavir in elderly patients, reflecting the greater \n\nfrequency of decreased hepatic function and of concomitant disease or other therapy (see sections 4.2 \n\nand 5.2).  \n\n \n\nSevere skin reactions \n\n \n\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), severe skin reactions, which \n\nmay be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of \n\npatients. DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome has been rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Darunavir should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include, \n\nbut are not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or \n\njoint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. \n\n  \n\nRash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing \n\ndarunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir \n\nor raltegravir without darunavir (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nDarunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. Darunavir should be used with caution in patients with a \n\nknown sulphonamide allergy.  \n\n \n\nHepatotoxicity \n\n \n\nDrug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with darunavir. \n\nDuring the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in \n\n0.5% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with darunavir/ritonavir. Patients with \n\npre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for \n\nliver function abnormalities including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \n\nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for \n\nthese medicinal products.  \n\n \n\nAppropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with darunavir used in \n\ncombination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. \n\nIncreased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, \n\ncirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first \n\nseveral months of darunavir used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir treatment.  \n\n \n\nIf there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of \n\nliver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver \n\ntenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients using darunavir used in combination with cobicistat or low dose \n\nritonavir, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered promptly.  \n\n \n\nPatients with coexisting conditions \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThe safety and efficacy of darunavir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver \n\ndisorders and darunavir is therefore contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Due to \n\nan increase in the unbound darunavir plasma concentrations, darunavir should be used with caution in \n\npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo special precautions or dose adjustments for darunavir/ritonavir are required in patients with renal \n\nimpairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they \n\nwill be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special \n\nprecautions or dose adjustments are required in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Cobicistat has \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nnot been studied in patients receiving dialysis, therefore, no recommendation can be made for the use \n\nof darunavir/cobicistat in these patients (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nCobicistat decreases the estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of \n\ncreatinine. This should be taken into consideration if darunavir with cobicistat is administered to \n\npatients in whom the estimated creatinine clearance is used to adjust doses of co-administered \n\nmedicinal products (see section 4.2 and cobicistat SmPC). \n\n  \n\nThere are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and \n\ncobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that \n\ninclude tenofovir disoproxil without cobicistat.  \n\n \n\nHaemophiliac patients \n\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \n\nhaemarthrosis in patients with haemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \n\nfactor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \n\nreintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested, although \n\nthe mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should, therefore, be made \n\naware of the possibility of increased bleeding.  \n\n \n\nWeight and metabolic parameters \n\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \n\ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \n\nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \n\nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \n\nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n\n \n\nOsteonecrosis \n\n \n\nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \n\nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \n\nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \n\njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.  \n\n \n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome \n\n \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \n\npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \n\nsuch reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant \n\nexamples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and \n\npneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any \n\ninflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. In addition, \n\nreactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed in clinical studies with darunavir \n\nco-administered with low dose ritonavir.  \n\n \n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \n\noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \n\nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\nInteractions with medicinal products \n\n \n\nSeveral of the interaction studies have been performed with darunavir at lower than recommended \n\ndoses. The effects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nmonitoring of safety may be indicated. For full information on interactions with other medicinal \n\nproducts see section 4.5. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic enhancer and concomitant medications \n\nDarunavir has different interaction profiles depending on whether the compound is boosted with \n\nritonavir or cobicistat:  \n\n- Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction: concomitant use of \n\ndarunavir/cobicistat and strong CYP3A inducers is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3), \n\nand concomitant use with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section \n\n4.5). Concomitant use of darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat with lopinavir/ritonavir, \n\nrifampicin and herbal products containing St John's wort, Hypericum perforatum, is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.5).  \n\n- Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not have inducing effects on enzymes or transport proteins (see \n\nsection 4.5). If switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required \n\nduring the first two weeks of treatment with darunavir/cobicistat, particularly if doses of any \n\nconcomitantly administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of \n\nritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer. A dose reduction of the co-administered drug may be needed \n\nin these cases.  \n\n \n\nEfavirenz in combination with darunavir  once daily may result in sub-optimal darunavir Cmin. If \n\nefavirenz is to be used in combination with darunavir, the darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily \n\nregimen should be used. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for darunavir 75 mg, 150 mg, \n\n300 mg and 600 mg tablets (see section 4.5).  \n\n \n\nLife-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and \n\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains sodium \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan 400 mg and 800 mg film-coated tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per \n\ndose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir may differ depending on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \n\npharmacoenhancer. The recommendations given for concomitant use of darunavir and other medicinal \n\nproducts may therefore differ depending on whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat \n\n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4), and caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching \n\nthe pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (ritonavir as pharmacoenhancer) \n\n \n\nDarunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity \n\nwould be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma \n\nconcentrations of these compounds and consequently that of darunavir, leading to loss of therapeutic \n\neffect and possible development of resistance (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). CYP3A inducers that are \n\ncontraindicated include rifampicin, St John's wort and lopinavir.  \n\n \n\nCo-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may \n\ndecrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, which may result in increased plasma concentrations \n\nof darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and \n\ncaution is warranted, these interactions are described in the interaction table below (e.g. indinavir, \n\nazole antifungals like clotrimazole).  \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (cobicistat as pharmacoenhancer) \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nDarunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A, and co-administration with CYP3A inducers \n\nmay therefore result in subtherapeutic plasma exposure to darunavir. Darunavir boosted with \n\ncobicistat is more sensitive to CYP3A induction than ritonavir-boosted darunavir: co-administration of \n\ndarunavir/cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. St John's wort, \n\nrifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\nCo-administration of darunavir/cobicistat with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz, \n\netravirine, nevirapine, boceprevir, fluticasone, and bosentan) is not recommended (see interaction table \n\nbelow).  \n\n \n\nFor co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the same recommendations apply independent \n\nof whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or with cobicistat (see section above).  \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir \n\n \n\nDarunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of \n\ndarunavir/ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or \n\ntransported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which \n\ncould increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that \n\nare highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated \n\nwith serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).  \n\n \n\nThe overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in \n\nthe systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in \n\ncombination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in \n\ncombination with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nA clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes \n\nCYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and \n\ninhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the \n\npresence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products \n\nwhich are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result \n\nin increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their \n\ntherapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal \n\nproducts primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) \n\nmay result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or \n\nshorten their therapeutic effect.  \n\n \n\nAlthough the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and \n\nritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, \n\nrepaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could \n\ndecrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.  \n\n \n\nRitonavir inhibits the transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co-administration \n\nwith substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds \n\n(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below).  \n\n \n\nMedicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with cobicistat \n\nThe recommendations for darunavir boosted with ritonavir are adequate also for darunavir boosted \n\nwith cobicistat with regard to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and \n\nOATP1B3 (see contraindications and recommendations presented in the section above). Cobicistat \n\n150 mg given with darunavir 800 mg once daily enhances darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in a \n\ncomparable way to ritonavir (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nUnlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or \n\nUGT1A1. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics.  \n\n \n\nInteraction table \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.  \n\n \n\nSeveral of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than \n\nrecommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The \n\neffects on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of \n\nsafety may be indicated.  \n\n \n\nThe interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as \n\npharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different recommendations for concomitant \n\nmedications depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. No \n\ninteraction studies presented in the table have been performed with darunavir boosted with cobicistat. \n\nThe same recommendations apply, unless specifically indicated. For further information on cobicistat, \n\nconsult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.  \n\n \n\nInteractions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products \n\nare listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based \n\non the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (\u2194), below (\u2193) or above (\u2191) \n\nthe 80-125% range (not determined as \u201cND\u201d).  \n\n \n\nIn the table below the specific pharmacokinetic enhancer is specified when recommendations differ. \n\nWhen the recommendation is the same for darunavir when co-administered with a low dose ritonavir \n\nor cobicistat, the term \u201cboosted darunavir\u201d is used.  \n\n \n\nThe below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of \n\neach drug that is co-administered with darunavir should be consulted for information related to the \n\nroute of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with \n\nregards to co-administration. \n\n \n\nINTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS \n\nMedicinal products by \n\ntherapeutic areas \n\nInteraction  \n\nGeometric mean change (%) \n\nRecommendations concerning co-\n\nadministration \n\nHIV ANTIRETROVIRALS \n\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors \n\nDolutegravir  dolutegravir AUC \u2193 22%  \n\ndolutegravir C24h \u219338%  \n\ndolutegravir Cmax \u2193 11%  \n\ndarunavir \u2194*  \n\n* Using cross-study comparisons to \n\nhistorical pharmacokinetic data  \n\nBoosted darunavir and dolutegravir can \n\nbe used without dose adjustment.  \n\n   \n\nRaltegravir  Some clinical studies suggest \n\nraltegravir may cause a modest \n\ndecrease in darunavir plasma \n\nconcentrations.  \n\nAt present the effect of raltegravir on \n\ndarunavir plasma concentrations does \n\nnot appear to be clinically relevant. \n\nBoosted darunavir and raltegravir can \n\nbe used without dose adjustments.  \n\nNucleo(s/t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) \n\nDidanosine  \n\n400 mg once daily  \n\ndidanosine AUC \u2193 9%  \n\ndidanosine Cmin ND  \n\ndidanosine Cmax \u2193 16%  \n\ndarunavir AUC \u2194  \n\nBoosted darunavir and didanosine can \n\nbe used without dose adjustments.  \n\nDidanosine is to be administered on an \n\nempty stomach, thus it should be \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\ndarunavir Cmin \u2194  \n\ndarunavir Cmax \u2194 \n\nadministered 1 hour before or 2 hours \n\nafter boosted darunavir given with \n\nfood.  \n\nTenofovir disoproxil  \n\n245 mg once daily\u2021  \n\ntenofovir AUC \u2191 22%  \n\ntenofovir Cmin \u2191 37%  \n\ntenofovir Cmax \u2191 24%  \n#darunavir AUC \u2191 21%  \n#darunavir Cmin \u2191 24%  \n#darunavir Cmax \u2191 16%  \n\n(\u2191 tenofovir from effect on MDR-1 \n\ntransport in the renal tubules)  \n\nMonitoring of renal function may be \n\nindicated when boosted darunavir is \n\ngiven in combination with tenofovir \n\ndisoproxil, particularly in patients with \n\nunderlying systemic or renal disease, or \n\nin patients taking nephrotoxic agents.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir co-administered with \n\ncobicistat lowers the creatinine \n\nclearance.

Therapy with Darunavir/cobicistat should not be initiated during \n\npregnancy, and women who become pregnant during therapy with Darunavir/cobicistat should be \n\nswitched to an alternative regimen (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\nDarunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the \n\npotential benefit justifies the potential risk.  \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nIt is not known whether darunavir is excreted in human milk. Studies in rats have demonstrated that \n\ndarunavir is excreted in milk and at high levels (1,000 mg/kg/day) resulted in toxicity. Because of both \n\nthe potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, mothers \n\nshould be instructed not to breast-feed under any circumstances if they are receiving darunavir.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nNo human data on the effect of darunavir on fertility are available.

However, dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with \n\nregimens containing darunavir co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and should be \n\nborne in mind when considering a patient's ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8).  \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nDuring the clinical development program (N=2,613 treatment-experienced subjects who initiated \n\ntherapy with darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily), 51.3% of subjects experienced at least one \n\nadverse reaction. The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent \n\nadverse reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, \n\nheadache and vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial \n\ninfarction, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, \n\ndiarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia.  \n\n \n\nIn the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-\n\nna\u00efve subjects was similar to that seen with darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in treatment-\n\nexperienced subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in treatment-na\u00efve \n\nsubjects. This was driven by mild intensity nausea. No new safety findings were identified in the \n\n192 week analysis of the treatment-na\u00efve subjects in which the mean treatment duration of \n\ndarunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily was 162.5 weeks.  \n\n \n\nDuring the Phase III clinical trial GS-US-216-130 with darunavir/cobicistat (N=313 treatment-na\u00efve \n\nand treatment-experienced subjects), 66.5% of subjects experienced at least one adverse reaction. The \n\nmean treatment duration was 58.4 weeks. The most frequent adverse reactions reported were diarrhoea \n\n(28%), nausea (23%), and rash (16%). Serious adverse reactions are diabetes mellitus, (drug) \n\nhypersensitivity, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, rash and vomiting.  \n\n \n\nFor information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions are listed by system organ class (SOC) and frequency category.

with darunavir/cobicistat but have been \n\nnoted with darunavir/ritonavir treatment and could be expected with darunavir/cobicistat too. \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nRash \n\nIn clinical trials, rash was mostly mild to moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of \n\ntreatment and resolving with continued dosing. In cases of severe skin reaction see the warning in \n\nsection 4.4. In a single arm trial investigating darunavir 800 mg once daily in combination with \n\ncobicistat 150 mg once daily and other antiretrovirals 2.2% of patients discontinued treatment due to \n\nrash.  \n\n \n\nDuring the clinical development program of raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients, rash, \n\nirrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing darunavir/ritonavir \n\n+ raltegravir compared to those containing darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir \n\nwithout darunavir/ritonavir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar \n\nrates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years \n\n(PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 per 100 PYR, respectively. The \n\nrashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in \n\ndiscontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nMetabolic parameters \n\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section \n\n4.4). \n\n \n\nMusculoskeletal abnormalities \n\nIncreased CPK, myalgia, myositis and rarely, rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of \n\nprotease inhibitors, particularly in combination with NRTIs.  \n\n \n\nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \n\nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). \n\nThe frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nImmune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome \n\nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \n\ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \n\nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \n\nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nBleeding in haemophiliac patients \n\nThere have been reports of increased spontaneous bleeding in haemophiliac patients receiving \n\nantiretroviral protease inhibitors (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nThe safety assessment in paediatric patients is based on the 48-week analysis of safety data from three \n\nPhase II trials. The following patient populations were evaluated (see section 5.1):  \n\n\u25cf 80 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 6 to 17 years and weighing at \n\nleast 20 kg who received darunavir tablets with low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination \n\nwith other antiretroviral agents.  \n\n\u25cf 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 3 to < 6 years and weighing \n\n10 kg to < 20 kg (16 participants from 15 kg to < 20 kg) who received darunavir oral suspension \n\nwith low dose ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. \n\n\u25cf 12 ART-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged from 12 to 17 years and weighing at least \n\n40 kg who received darunavir tablets with low dose ritonavir once daily in combination with \n\nother antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).  \n\n \n\nOverall, the safety profile in these paediatric patients was similar to that observed in the adult \n\npopulation.  \n\n \n\nOther special populations \n\n \n\nPatients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus \n\nAmong 1,968 treatment-experienced patients receiving darunavir co-administered with ritonavir \n\n600/100 mg twice daily, 236 patients were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected patients were \n\nmore likely to have baseline and treatment emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those \n\nwithout chronic viral hepatitis (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nHuman experience of acute overdose with darunavir co-administered with cobicistat or low dose \n\nritonavir is limited. Single doses up to 3,200 mg of darunavir as oral solution alone and up to 1,600 mg \n\nof the tablet formulation of darunavir in combination with ritonavir have been administered to healthy \n\nvolunteers without untoward symptomatic effects.  \n\n \n\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with darunavir. Treatment of overdose with darunavir \n\nconsists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the \n\nclinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be \n\nbeneficial in significant removal of the active substance. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitors, ATC code: J05AE10.  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nDarunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease (KD of \n\n4.5 x 10-12M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus \n\ninfected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles. \n\n  \n\nAntiviral activity in vitro  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nDarunavir exhibits activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and laboratory \n\nstrains of HIV-2 in acutely infected T-cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human \n\nmonocytes/macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 nM (0.7 to 5.0 ng/ml). \n\nDarunavir demonstrates antiviral activity in vitro against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (A, B, C, D, \n\nE, F, G) and group O primary isolates with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 4.3 nM.  \n\n \n\nThese EC50 values are well below the 50% cellular toxicity concentration range of 87 \u00b5M to \n\n> 100 \u00b5M.  \n\n \n\nResistance \n\n \n\nIn vitro selection of darunavir-resistant virus from wild type HIV-1 was lengthy (> 3 years). The \n\nselected viruses were unable to grow in the presence of darunavir concentrations above 400 nM. \n\nViruses selected in these conditions and showing decreased susceptibility to darunavir (range: \n\n23-50-fold) harboured 2 to 4 amino acid substitutions in the protease gene. The decreased \n\nsusceptibility to darunavir of the emerging viruses in the selection experiment could not be explained \n\nby the emergence of these protease mutations.  \n\n \n\nThe clinical trial data from ART-experienced patients (TITAN trial and the pooled analysis of the \n\nPOWER 1, 2 and 3 and DUET 1 and 2 trials) showed that virologic response to darunavir co-\n\nadministered with low dose ritonavir was decreased when 3 or more darunavir RAMs (V11I, V32I, \n\nL33F, I47V, I50V, I54L or M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V) were present at baseline or when these \n\nmutations developed during treatment. \n\n  \n\nIncreasing baseline darunavir fold change in EC50 (FC) was associated with decreasing virologic \n\nresponse. A lower and upper clinical cut-off of 10 and 40 were identified. Isolates with baseline FC \u2264 \n\n10 are susceptible; isolates with FC > 10 to 40 have decreased susceptibility; isolates with FC > 40 are \n\nresistant (see Clinical results).  \n\n \n\nViruses isolated from patients on darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily experiencing virologic \n\nfailure by rebound that were susceptible to tipranavir at baseline remained susceptible to tipranavir \n\nafter treatment in the vast majority of cases. \n\n  \n\nThe lowest rates of developing resistant HIV virus are observed in ART-na\u00efve patients who are treated \n\nfor the first time with darunavir in combination with other ART.  \n\n \n\nThe table below shows the development of HIV-1 protease mutations and loss of susceptibility to PIs \n\nin virologic failures at endpoint in the ARTEMIS, ODIN and TITAN trials.  \n\n \n\n  ARTEMIS \n\nWeek 192 \n\nODIN \n\nWeek 48 \n\nTITAN \n\nWeek 48 \n\n  darunavir/ \n\nritonavir \n\n800/100 mg \n\nonce daily \n\nN=343 \n\ndarunavir/ ritonavir \n\n800/100 mg \n\nonce daily \n\nN=294 \n\ndarunavir/ ritonavir \n\n600/100 mg \n\ntwice daily \n\nN=296 \n\ndarunavir/ ritonavir \n\n600/100 mg \n\ntwice daily \n\nN=298 \n\nTotal number of \n\nvirologic failuresa, \n\nn (%) \n\nRebounders  \n\nNever suppressed \n\nsubjects  \n\n55 (16.0%) \n\n \n\n \n\n39 (11.4%) \n\n16 (4.7%) \n\n65 (22.1%) \n\n \n\n \n\n11 (3.7%) \n\n54 (18.4%) \n\n54 (18.2%) \n\n \n\n \n\n11 (3.7%) \n\n43 (14.5%) \n\n31 (10.4%) \n\n \n\n \n\n16 (5.4%) \n\n15 (5.0%) \n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint genotypes, developing mutationsb at \n\nendpoint, n/N  \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nPrimary (major) PI \n\nmutations  \n\nPI RAMs  \n\n0/43 \n\n \n\n4/43 \n\n1/60 \n\n \n\n7/60 \n\n0/42 \n\n \n\n4/42 \n\n6/28 \n\n \n\n10/28 \n\nNumber of subjects with virologic failure and paired baseline/endpoint phenotypes, showing loss of susceptibility \n\nto PIs at endpoint compared to baseline, n/N  \n\nPI          \n\ndarunavir  \n\namprenavir  \n\natazanavir  \n\nindinavir  \n\nlopinavir  \n\nsaquinavir  \n\ntipranavir  \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n0/39 \n\n1/58 \n\n1/58 \n\n2/56 \n\n2/57 \n\n1/58 \n\n0/56 \n\n0/58 \n\n0/41 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/40 \n\n0/41 \n\n3/26 \n\n0/22 \n\n0/22 \n\n1/24 \n\n0/23 \n\n0/22 \n\n1/25 \n\na  TLOVR non-VF censored algorithm based on HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml, except for TITAN (HIV-1 RNA < 400 \n\ncopies/ml)  \nb IAS-USA lists \n\n \n\nLow rates of developing resistant HIV-1 virus were observed in ART-na\u00efve patients who are treated \n\nfor the first time with darunavir/cobicistat once daily in combination with other ART, and in ART-\n\nexperienced patients with no darunavir RAMs receiving darunavir/cobicistat in combination with \n\nother ART.

Virologic response was preserved throughout the \n\nstudy period in both arms. No mother to child transmission occurred in the infants born to the \n\n31 subjects who stayed on the antiretroviral treatment through delivery. There were no new clinically \n\nrelevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1 \n\ninfected adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with cobicistat or ritonavir, have been \n\nevaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher \n\nin HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 \n\ninfected patients compared to healthy subjects may be explained by the higher concentrations of \u03b11-\n\nacid glycoprotein (AAG) in HIV-1 infected patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to plasma \n\nAAG and, therefore, higher plasma concentrations.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Cobicistat and ritonavir inhibit CYP3A, thereby \n\nincreasing the plasma concentrations of darunavir considerably.  \n\n \n\nFor information on cobicistat pharmacokinetic properties, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product \n\nCharacteristics.  \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\n \n\nDarunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration of \n\ndarunavir in the presence of low dose ritonavir is generally achieved within 2.5-4.0 hours.  \n\n \n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% \n\nand increased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The overall \n\npharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic \n\nexposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with \n\nritonavir at 100 mg twice daily (see section 4.4).  \n\n \n\nWhen administered without food, the relative bioavailability of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat \n\nor low dose ritonavir is lower as compared to intake with food. Therefore, darunavir tablets should be \n\ntaken with cobicistat or ritonavir and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to \n\ndarunavir.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nDarunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma \u03b11-acid \n\nglycoprotein.  \n\n \n\nFollowing intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of darunavir alone was 88.1 \u00b1 59.0 l \n\n(Mean \u00b1 SD) and increased to 131 \u00b1 49.9 l (Mean \u00b1 SD) in the presence of 100 mg twice-daily \n\nritonavir.  \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn vitro experiments with human liver microsomes (HLMs) indicate that darunavir primarily \n\nundergoes oxidative metabolism. Darunavir is extensively metabolised by the hepatic CYP system and \n\nalmost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A4. A 14C-darunavir trial in healthy volunteers showed that a \n\nmajority of the radioactivity in plasma after a single 400/100 mg darunavir with ritonavir dose was due \n\nto the parent active substance. At least 3 oxidative metabolites of darunavir have been identified in \n\nhumans; all showed activity that was at least 10-fold less than the activity of darunavir against wild \n\ntype HIV.  \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nAfter a 400/100 mg 14C-darunavir with ritonavir dose, approximately 79.5% and 13.9% of the \n\nadministered dose of 14C-darunavir could be retrieved in faeces and urine, respectively. Unchanged \n\ndarunavir accounted for approximately 41.2% and 7.7% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, \n\nrespectively. The terminal elimination half-life of darunavir was approximately 15 hours when \n\ncombined with ritonavir.  \n\nThe intravenous clearance of darunavir alone (150 mg) and in the presence of low dose ritonavir was \n\n32.8 l/h and 5.9 l/h, respectively.  \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in 74 treatment-\n\nexperienced paediatric patients, aged 6 to 17 years and weighing at least 20 kg, showed that the \n\nadministered weight-based doses of darunavir/ritonavir resulted in darunavir exposure comparable to \n\nthat in adults receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in 14 treatment-\n\nexperienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 15 kg to < 20 kg, showed \n\nthat weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in \n\nadults receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 12 ART-na\u00efve \n\npaediatric patients, aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg, showed that darunavir/ritonavir \n\n800/100 mg once daily results in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in adults \n\nreceiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily. Therefore the same once daily dosage may be \n\nused in treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg without \n\ndarunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA \n\n< 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \u2265 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).  \n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V  \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 10 treatment-\n\nexperienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to < 20 kg, showed \n\nthat weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in \n\nadults receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, \n\npharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages \n\nof 3 to < 18 years confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed \n\nthe identification of weight-based darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric \n\npatients weighing at least 15 kg that are either ART-na\u00efve or treatment-experienced paediatric patients \n\nwithout DRV-RAMs* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count \n\n\u2265 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).  \n* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V  \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV infected patients showed that darunavir pharmacokinetics \n\nare not considerably different in the age range (18 to 75 years) evaluated in HIV infected patients \n\n(n=12, age \u2265 65) (see section 4.4). However, only limited data were available in patients above the age \n\nof 65 year.  \n\n \n\nGender \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis showed a slightly higher darunavir exposure (16.8%) in HIV \n\ninfected females compared to males. This difference is not clinically relevant.  \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nResults from a mass balance study with 14C-darunavir with ritonavir showed that approximately 7.7% \n\nof the administered dose of darunavir is excreted in the urine unchanged. \n\n  \n\nAlthough darunavir has not been studied in patients with renal impairment, population \n\npharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly \n\naffected in HIV infected patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl between 30-60 ml/min, n=20) \n\n(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nDarunavir is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. In a multiple dose study with darunavir \n\nco-administered with ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily, it was demonstrated that the total plasma \n\nconcentrations of darunavir in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, n=8) and moderate (Child-\n\nPugh Class B, n=8) hepatic impairment were comparable with those in healthy subjects. However, \n\nunbound darunavir concentrations were approximately 55% (Child-Pugh Class A) and 100% (Child-\n\nPugh Class B) higher, respectively. The clinical relevance of this increase is unknown therefore, \n\ndarunavir should be used with caution. The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the \n\npharmacokinetics of darunavir has not been studied (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and postpartum \n\nThe exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice \n\ndaily and darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally \n\nlower during pregnancy compared with postpartum. However, for unbound (i.e. active) darunavir, the \n\npharmacokinetic parameters were less reduced during pregnancy compared to postpartum, due to an \n\nincrease in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum. \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at 600/100 mg \n\ntwice daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of pregnancy, the third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy and postpartum \n\nPharmacokinetics of \n\ntotal darunavir \n\n(mean \u00b1 SD) \n\nSecond trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=12)a \n\nThird trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=12) \n\nPostpartum  \n\n(6-12 weeks) \n\n(n=12) \n\nCmax, ng/ml 4,668 \u00b1 1,097 5,328 \u00b1 1,631 6,659 \u00b1 2,364 \n\nAUC12h, ng.h/ml 39,370 \u00b1 9,597 45,880 \u00b1 17,360 56,890 \u00b1 26,340 \n\nCmin, ng/ml 1,922 \u00b1 825 2,661 \u00b1 1,269 2,851 \u00b1 2,216 \na n=11 for AUC12h \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/ritonavir at 800/100 mg \n\nonce daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of pregnancy, the third \n\ntrimester of pregnancy and postpartum \n\nPharmacokinetics of \n\ntotal darunavir (mean \n\n\u00b1 SD) \n\nSecond trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=17) \n\nThird Trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=15) \n\nPostpartum  \n\n(6-12 weeks) \n\n(n=16) \n\nCmax, ng/ml 4,964 \u00b1 1,505 5,132 \u00b1 1,198 7,310 \u00b1 1,704 \n\nAUC24h, ng.h/ml 62,289 \u00b1 16,234 61,112 \u00b1 13,790 92,116 \u00b1 29,241 \n\nCmin, ng/ml 1,248 \u00b1 542 1,075 \u00b1 594 1,473 \u00b1 1,141 \n\n \n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin were 28%, 26% and \n\n26% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \n\ndarunavir Cmax, AUC12h and Cmin values were 18%, 16% lower and 2% higher, respectively, as \n\ncompared with postpartum. \n\n \n\nIn women receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 33%, 31% and \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n30% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total \n\ndarunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 29%, 32% and 50% lower, respectively, as compared \n\nwith postpartum. \n\n \n\nTreatment with darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once daily during pregnancy results in low darunavir \n\nexposure. In women receiving darunavir/cobicistat during the second trimester of pregnancy, mean \n\nintra-individual values for total darunavir Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin were 49%, 56% and 92% lower, \n\nrespectively, as compared with postpartum; during the third trimester of pregnancy, total darunavir \n\nCmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were 37%, 50% and 89% lower, respectively, as compared with \n\npostpartum. The unbound fraction was also substantially reduced, including around 90% reductions of \n\nCmin levels. The main cause of these low exposures is a marked reduction in cobicistat exposure as a \n\nconsequence of pregnancy-associated enzyme induction (see below). \n\n \n\nPharmacokinetic results of total darunavir after administration of darunavir/cobicistat  \n\n800/150 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen, during the second trimester of \n\npregnancy, the third trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum \n\nPharmacokinetics of \n\ntotal darunavir (mean \n\n\u00b1 SD) \n\nSecond trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=7) \n\nThird trimester of \n\npregnancy \n\n(n=6) \n\nPostpartum  \n\n(6-12 weeks) \n\n(n=6) \n\nCmax, ng/mL 4,340 \u00b1 1,616 4,910 \u00b1 970 7,918 \u00b1 2,199 \n\nAUC24h, ng.h/mL 47,293 \u00b1 19,058 47,991 \u00b1 9,879 99,613 \u00b1 34,862 \n\nCmin, ng/mL 168 \u00b1 149 184 \u00b1 99 1,538 \u00b1 1,344 \n\nThe exposure to cobicistat was lower during pregnancy, potentially leading to suboptimal boosting of \n\ndarunavir. During the second trimester of pregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin were 50%, \n\n63%, and 83% lower, respectively, as compared with postpartum. During the third trimester of \n\npregnancy, cobicistat Cmax, AUC24h, and Cmin, were 27%, 49%, and 83% lower, respectively, as \n\ncompared with postpartum. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAnimal toxicology studies have been conducted at exposures up to clinical exposure levels with \n\ndarunavir alone, in mice, rats and dogs and in combination with ritonavir in rats and dogs.  \n\n \n\nIn repeated-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs, there were only limited effects of treatment \n\nwith darunavir. In rodents the target organs identified were the haematopoietic system, the blood \n\ncoagulation system, liver and thyroid. A variable but limited decrease in red blood cell-related \n\nparameters was observed, together with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time.  \n\n \n\nChanges were observed in liver (hepatocyte hypertrophy, vacuolation, increased liver enzymes) and \n\nthyroid (follicular hypertrophy). In the rat, the combination of darunavir with ritonavir lead to a small \n\nincrease in effect on RBC parameters, liver and thyroid and increased incidence of islet fibrosis in the \n\npancreas (in male rats only) compared to treatment with darunavir alone. In the dog, no major toxicity \n\nfindings or target organs were identified up to exposures equivalent to clinical exposure at the \n\nrecommended dose.  \n\n \n\nIn a study conducted in rats, the number of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased in the \n\npresence of maternal toxicity. Otherwise, there were no effects on mating or fertility with darunavir \n\ntreatment up to 1,000 mg/kg/day and exposure levels below (AUC-0.5 fold) of that in human at the \n\nclinically recommended dose. Up to same dose levels, there was no teratogenicity with darunavir in \n\nrats and rabbits when treated alone nor in mice when treated in combination with ritonavir. The \n\nexposure levels were lower than those with the recommended clinical dose in humans. In a pre- and \n\npostnatal development assessment in rats, darunavir with and without ritonavir, caused a transient \n\nreduction in body weight gain of the offspring pre-weaning and there was a slight delay in the opening \n\nof eyes and ears. Darunavir in combination with ritonavir caused a reduction in the number of pups \n\nthat exhibited the startle response on day 15 of lactation and a reduced pup survival during lactation. \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\nThese effects may be secondary to pup exposure to the active substance via the milk and/or maternal \n\ntoxicity. No post weaning functions were affected with darunavir alone or in combination with \n\nritonavir. In juvenile rats receiving darunavir up to days 23-26, increased mortality was observed with \n\nconvulsions in some animals. Exposure in plasma, liver and brain was considerably higher than in \n\nadult rats after comparable doses in mg/kg between days 5 and 11 of age. After day 23 of life, the \n\nexposure was comparable to that in adult rats. The increased exposure was likely at least partly due to \n\nimmaturity of the drug-metabolising enzymes in juvenile animals. No treatment related mortalities \n\nwere noted in juvenile rats dosed at 1,000 mg/kg darunavir (single dose) on day 26 of age or at \n\n500 mg/kg (repeated dose) from day 23 to 50 of age, and the exposures and toxicity profile were \n\ncomparable to those observed in adult rats.  \n\n \n\nDue to uncertainties regarding the rate of development of the human blood brain barrier and liver \n\nenzymes, darunavir with low dose ritonavir should not be used in paediatric patients below 3 years of \n\nage. \n\n \n\nDarunavir was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats up \n\nto 104 weeks. Daily doses of 150, 450 and 1,000 mg/kg were administered to mice and doses of 50, \n\n150 and 500 mg/kg were administered to rats. Dose-related increases in the incidences of \n\nhepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were observed in males and females of both species. Thyroid \n\nfollicular cell adenomas were noted in male rats. Administration of darunavir did not cause a \n\nstatistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or \n\nrats. The observed hepatocellular and thyroid tumours in rodents are considered to be of limited \n\nrelevance to humans. Repeated administration of darunavir to rats caused hepatic microsomal enzyme \n\ninduction and increased thyroid hormone elimination, which predispose rats, but not humans, to \n\nthyroid neoplasms. At the highest tested doses, the systemic exposures (based on AUC) to darunavir \n\nwere between 0.4- and 0.7-fold (mice) and 0.7- and 1-fold (rats), relative to those observed in humans \n\nat the recommended therapeutic doses.  \n\n \n\nAfter 2 years administration of darunavir at exposures at or below the human exposure, kidney \n\nchanges were observed in mice (nephrosis) and rats (chronic progressive nephropathy).  \n\n \n\nDarunavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including \n\nbacterial reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes and in vivo \n\nmicronucleus test in mice.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Darunavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat is Darunavir Mylan? \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains the active substance darunavir. Darunavir is an antiretroviral medicine used \n\nin the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called protease inhibitors. Darunavir works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. \n\nThis will improve your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nWhat it is used for?  \n\nDarunavir is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram \n\nbody weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Darunavir Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Darunavir Mylan \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) or to ritonavir.  \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary. \n\n \n\nDo not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines  \n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine. \n\n \n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine \n\nAvanafil  to treat erectile dysfunction  \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nAstemizole or terfenadine  to treat allergy symptoms  \n\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam  to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety  \n\nCisapride  to treat some stomach conditions  \n\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \n\nproblems)  \n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever \n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole  to treat psychiatric conditions  \n\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \n\nmethylergonovine  \n\nto treat migraine headaches  \n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, \n\nquinidine, ranolazine  \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal heart \n\nbeat  \n\nLovastatin simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels  \n\nRifampicin  to treat some infections such as tuberculosis  \n\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir  this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class as \n\ndarunavir \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection \n\nAlfuzosin  to treat enlarged prostate  \n\nSildenafil  to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation  \n\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart attack  \n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation \n\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation \n\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting \n\n \n\nDo not combine darunavir with products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Darunavir Mylan.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \n\nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \n\npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.  \n\n \n\nIn patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \n\nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment  \n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \n\ntake darunavir.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood.  \n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \n\nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \n\noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \n\nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \n\nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \n\nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  \n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).  \n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \n\nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \n\nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \n\nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \n\nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \n\ninform your doctor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDarunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \n\nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nChildren  \n\nDarunavir is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Darunavir Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above \n\nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:\u2019 \n\n  \n\nIn most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \n\nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with ritonavir has not been tested \n\nwith all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage of \n\nother medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other anti-\n\nHIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines can be combined.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products.

Darunavir might \nreduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of non-hormonal \n\ncontraception are recommended.  \n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Darunavir might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone. \n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage \nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \n\nyour specific situation.  \n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Darunavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat is Darunavir Mylan? \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains the active substance darunavir. Darunavir is an antiretroviral medicine used \n\nin the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called protease inhibitors. Darunavir works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. \n\nThis will improve your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nWhat it is used for?  \n\nDarunavir is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram \n\nbody weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Darunavir Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Darunavir Mylan \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) or to ritonavir.  \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary. \n\n \n\nDo not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines  \n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine. \n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine \n\nAvanafil  to treat erectile dysfunction  \n\nAstemizole or terfenadine  to treat allergy symptoms  \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam  to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety  \n\nCisapride  to treat some stomach conditions  \n\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \n\nproblems)  \n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever \n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapineor sertindole  to treat psychiatric conditions  \n\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \n\nmethylergonovine  \n\nto treat migraine headaches  \n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, \n\nquinidine, ranolazine  \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal heart \n\nbeat  \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels  \n\nRifampicin  to treat some infections such as tuberculosis  \n\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir  this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class as \n\ndarunavir \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection \n\nAlfuzosin  to treat enlarged prostate  \n\nSildenafil  to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation  \n\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart attack  \n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation \n\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation \n\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting \n\n \n\nDo not combine darunavir with products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Darunavir Mylan.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \n\nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \n\npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.  \n\n \n\nIn patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \n\nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment  \n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \n\ntake darunavir.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood.  \n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \n\nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur \n\nsoon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \n\nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have \n\nbeen present with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the \n\nstart of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle \n\nweakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the \n\nbody, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  \n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).  \n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue \n\ncaused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, \n\ncorticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, \n\namong others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of \n\nosteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and \n\ndifficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDarunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \n\nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nChildren  \n\nDarunavir is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Darunavir Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above \n\nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:\u2019 \n\n  \n\nIn most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \n\nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with ritonavir has not been tested \n\nwith all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage of \n\nother medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other anti-\n\nHIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines can be combined.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor \n\nif you take:  \n\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)  \n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)  \n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)  \n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)  \n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)  \n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).  \n\n \n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take darunavir.

Darunavir might \nreduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of non-hormonal \n\ncontraception are recommended.  \n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Darunavir might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage \nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \n\nyour specific situation.  \n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased.

Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.  \n\n \n\nIn patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \n\nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment  \n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \n\ntake darunavir.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood.  \n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \n\nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \n\nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \n\nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \n\nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \n\nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  \n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).  \n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \n\nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \n\nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \n\nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \n\nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \n\ninform your doctor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDarunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \n\nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nChildren  \n\nDarunavir is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Darunavir Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above \n\nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:\u2019 \n\n  \n\nIn most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \n\nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with ritonavir has not been tested \n\nwith all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage of \n\nother medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other anti-\n\nHIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines can be combined.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor \n\nif you take:  \n\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)  \n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)  \n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)  \n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)  \n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)  \n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).  \n\n \n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take darunavir. Tell your doctor if you take:  \n\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaide, metoprolol, \nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \n\ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.  \n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood. \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. Darunavir might \nreduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of non-hormonal \n\ncontraception are recommended.  \n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Darunavir might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone. \n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle demage \nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \n\nyour specific situation.  \n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \n\nwant to do some additional tests.  \n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \n\ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \n\nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \n\nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects. \n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioide dependence)  \n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)  \n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)  \n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)  \n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection)  \n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain) \n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders). \n \n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or darunavir\u2019s \n\ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor if you take:  \n\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)  \n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)  \n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \n\ninfections). Voriconazole should only be taken after medical evaluation.  \n\n- Rifabutin (against bacterial infections)  \n- Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil (for erectile dysfunction or high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation)  \n\n- Amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone (to treat \ndepression and anxiety)  \n\n- Maraviroc (to treat HIV infection)  \n- Methadone (to treat opiate dependance)  \n- Carbamazepine, clonazepam (to prevent seizures or to treat certain types of nerve pain)  \n- Colchicine (to treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever)  \n- Bosentan (to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation)  \n- Buspirone, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam when used as injection, \n\nzoldipem (sedative agents)  \n\n- Perphenazine, risperidone, thioridazine (to treat psychiatric conditions).  \n \n\nThis is not a complete list of medicines. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines that you are \n\ntaking. \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan with food and drink \n\nSee section 3 \u2018How to take Darunavir Mylan\u2019. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or if you are breast-\n\nfeeding. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers must not take darunavir with ritonavir unless specifically \n\ndirected by the doctor. Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take darunavir with cobicistat. \n\n \nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \n\npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \n\nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking Darunavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\n\nfree\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Darunavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat is Darunavir Mylan? \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains the active substance darunavir. Darunavir is an antiretroviral medicine used \n\nin the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called protease inhibitors. Darunavir works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. \n\nThis will improve your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nWhat it is used for?  \n\nDarunavir is used to treat adults and children 3 years of age and above, at least 40 kilograms body \n\nweight) who are infected by HIV and  \n\n- who have not used antiretroviral medicines before.  \n- in certain patients who have used antiretroviral medicines before (your doctor will determine \n\nthis). \n\n \n\nDarunavir must be taken in combination with a low dose of cobicistat or ritonavir and other anti-HIV \n\nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Darunavir Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Darunavir Mylan \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) or to cobicistat or ritonavir.  \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary. \n\nDo not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines  \n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine. \n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\nAvanafil  to treat erectile dysfunction  \n\nAstemizole or terfenadine  to treat allergy symptoms  \n\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam  to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety  \n\nCisapride  to treat some stomach conditions  \n\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \n\nproblems)  \n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever \n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole  to treat psychiatric conditions  \n\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \n\nmethylergonovine  \n\nto treat migraine headaches  \n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, \n\nquinidine, ranolazine  \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal heart \n\nbeat  \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels  \n\nRifampicin  to treat some infections such as tuberculosis  \n\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir  this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class as \n\ndarunavir  \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection \n\nAlfuzosin  to treat enlarged prostate  \n\nSildenafil  to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation  \n\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart attack  \n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation \n\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation \n\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting \n\n \n\nDo not combine darunavir with products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Darunavir Mylan.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \n\nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \n\npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.  \n\n \n\nIn patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \n\nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment  \n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \n\ntake darunavir.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood.  \n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \n\nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \n\noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \n\n\n\n154 \n\n \n\nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \n\nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \n\nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \n\nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  \n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).  \n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \n\nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \n\nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \n\nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \n\nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \n\ninform your doctor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDarunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \n\nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDarunavir is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Darunavir Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above \n\nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:\u2019 \n\n \n\nIn most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \n\nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with cobicistat or ritonavir has \n\nnot been tested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some \n\ncases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you \n\ntake other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines can \n\nbe combined.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor \n\nif you take:  \n\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)  \n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)  \n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)  \n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)  \n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)  \n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).  \n\n \n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take darunavir. Tell your doctor if you take:  \n\n- Amlodipine, diltiazem, disopyramide, carvedilol, felodipine, flecainide, lidocaine, metoprolol, \nmexiletine, nifedipine, nicardipine, propafenone, timolol, verapamil (for heart disease) as the \n\ntherapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines may be increased.  \n\n- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, warfarin (to reduce clotting of the blood) as their therapeutic \neffect or side effects may be altered; your doctor may have to check your blood. \n\n\n\n155 \n\n \n\n- Oestrogen-based hormonal contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy. Darunavir might \nreduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of non-hormonal \n\ncontraception are recommended.  \n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Darunavir might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone. \n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage \nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \n\nyour specific situation.  \n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased. Your doctor might \n\nwant to do some additional tests.  \n\n- Corticosteroids including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, \ntriamcinolone. These medicines are used to treat allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel \n\ndiseases, inflammatory conditions of the eyes, joints and muscles and other inflammatory \n\nconditions. If alternatives cannot be used, its use should only take place after medical evaluation \n\nand under close monitoring by your doctor for corticosteroid side effects. \n\n- Buprenorphine/naloxone (medicines to treat opioid dependence)  \n- Salmeterol (medicine to treat asthma)  \n- Artemether/lumefantrine (a combination medicine to treat malaria)  \n- Dasatinib, everolimus, irinotecan, nilotinib, vinblastine, vincristine (to treat cancer)  \n- Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil (for erectile dysfunction or to treat a heart and lung disorder \n\ncalled pulmonary arterial hypertension) \n\n- Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, simeprevir (to treat hepatitis C infection) \n- Fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol (to treat pain) \n- Fesoterodine, solifenacin (to treat urologic disorders). \n \n\nThe dosage of other medicines might need to be changed since either their own or darunavir\u2019s \n\ntherapeutic effect or side effects may be influenced when combined.  \n\nTell your doctor if you take:  \n\n- Alfentanil (injectable strong and short-acting painkiller that is used for surgical procedures)  \n- Digoxin (to treat certain heart disorders)  \n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n\n- Itraconazole, isavuconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, clotrimazole (to treat fungal \ninfections).

Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers must not take darunavir with ritonavir unless specifically \n\ndirected by the doctor.  Pregnant or breast-feeding mothers should not take darunavir with cobicistat. \n\n \nIt is recommended that HIV infected women must not breast-feed their infants because of both the \n\npossibility of your baby becoming infected with HIV through your breast milk and because of the \n\nunknown effects of the medicine on your baby.  \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not operate machines or drive if you feel dizzy after taking darunavir. \n\n \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-\n\nfree\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Darunavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat is Darunavir Mylan? \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains the active substance darunavir. Darunavir is an antiretroviral medicine used \n\nin the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called protease inhibitors. Darunavir works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. \n\nThis will improve your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nWhat it is used for?  \n\nDarunavir is used to treat adults and children of 3 years of age and above, and at least 15 kilogram \n\nbody weight who are infected by HIV and who have already used other antiretroviral medicines.  \n\nDarunavir must be taken in combination with a low dose of ritonavir and other anti-HIV medicines. \n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Darunavir Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Darunavir Mylan \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) or to ritonavir.  \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary. \n\n \n\nDo not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines  \n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine. \n\n \n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine \n\nAvanafil  to treat erectile dysfunction  \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \n\nAstemizole or terfenadine  to treat allergy symptoms  \n\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam  to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety  \n\nCisapride  to treat some stomach conditions  \n\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \n\nproblems)  \n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever \n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapineor sertindole  to treat psychiatric conditions  \n\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \n\nmethylergonovine  \n\nto treat migraine headaches  \n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, \n\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal heart \n\nbeat  \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels  \n\nRifampicin  to treat some infections such as tuberculosis  \n\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir  this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class as \n\nDarunavir Mylan  \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection \n\nAlfuzosin  to treat enlarged prostate  \n\nSildenafil  to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation  \n\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart attack  \n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation \n\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation \n\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting \n\n \n\nDo not combine darunavir with products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Darunavir Mylan.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \n\nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \n\npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.  \n\n \n\nIn patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \n\nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment  \n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \n\ntake darunavir.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood.  \n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \n\nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur \n\n\n\n164 \n\n \n\nsoon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \n\nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have \n\nbeen present with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the \n\nstart of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle \n\nweakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the \n\nbody, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  \n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).  \n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue \n\ncaused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, \n\ncorticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, \n\namong others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of \n\nosteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and \n\ndifficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDarunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \n\nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan. \n\n \n\nChildren  \n\nDarunavir is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 15 kilograms. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Darunavir Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above \n\nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:\u2019 \n\n  \n\nIn most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \n\nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with ritonavir has not been tested \n\nwith all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some cases dosage of \n\nother medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you take other anti-\n\nHIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines can be combined.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products. Tell your doctor \n\nif you take:  \n\n- Phenobarbital, phenytoin (to prevent seizures)  \n- Dexamethasone (corticosteroid)  \n- Efavirenz (HIV infection)  \n- Boceprevir (hepatitis C infection)  \n- Rifapentine, rifabutin (medicines to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)  \n- Saquinavir (HIV infection).  \n\n \n\nThe effects of other medicines might be influenced if you take darunavir.

Darunavir might \nreduce its effectiveness. When used for birth control, alternative methods of non-hormonal \n\ncontraception are recommended.  \n\n- Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone. Darunavir might increase the risk for elevated potassium levels \nby drospirenone. \n\n- Atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin (to lower cholesterol levels). The risk of muscle damage \nmight be increased. Your doctor will evaluate which cholesterol lowering regimen is best for \n\nyour specific situation.  \n\n- Clarithromycin (antibiotic)  \n- Ciclosporin, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus (for dampening down your immune system) as \n\nthe therapeutic effect or side effects of these medicines might be increased.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Darunavir Mylan is and what it is used for \n \n\nWhat is Darunavir Mylan? \n\nDarunavir Mylan contains the active substance darunavir. Darunavir is an antiretroviral medicine used \n\nin the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines called protease inhibitors. Darunavir works by reducing the amount of HIV in your body. \n\nThis will improve your immune system and reduces the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV \n\ninfection. \n\n \n\nWhat it is used for?  \n\nDarunavir is used to treat adults and children (3 years of age and above, at least 40 kilograms body \n\nweight) who are infected by HIV and  \n\n- who have not used antiretroviral medicines before.  \n- in certain patients who have used antiretroviral medicines before (your doctor will determine \n\nthis). \n\n \n\nDarunavir must be taken in combination with a low dose of cobicistat or ritonavir and other anti-HIV \n\nmedicines. Your doctor will discuss with you which combination of medicines is best for you. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Darunavir Mylan \n \n\nDo not take Darunavir Mylan \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to darunavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6) or to cobicistat or ritonavir.  \n\n- if you have severe liver problems. Ask your doctor if you are unsure about the severity of your \nliver disease. Some additional tests might be necessary. \n\n \n\nDo not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines  \n\nIf you are taking any of these, ask your doctor about switching to another medicine. \n\n\n\n174 \n\n \n\nMedicine Purpose of the medicine \n\nAvanafil  to treat erectile dysfunction  \n\nAstemizole or terfenadine  to treat allergy symptoms  \n\nTriazolam and oral (taken by mouth) midazolam  to help you sleep and/or relieve anxiety  \n\nCisapride  to treat some stomach conditions  \n\nColchicine (if you have kidney and/or liver \n\nproblems)  \n\nto treat gout or familial Mediterranean fever \n\nLurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine or sertindole  to treat psychiatric conditions  \n\nErgot alkaloids like ergotamine, \n\ndihydroergotamine, ergometrine and \n\nmethylergonovine  \n\nto treat migraine headaches  \n\nAmiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, \n\nquinidine, ranolazine \n\nto treat certain heart disorders e.g. abnormal heart \n\nbeat  \n\nLovastatin, simvastatin and lomitapide to lower cholesterol levels  \n\nRifampicin  to treat some infections such as tuberculosis  \n\nThe combination product lopinavir/ritonavir  this anti-HIV medicine belongs to the same class as \n\nDarunavir Mylan  \n\nElbasvir/grazoprevir to treat hepatitis C infection \n\nAlfuzosin  to treat enlarged prostate  \n\nSildenafil  to treat high blood pressure in the pulmonary \n\ncirculation  \n\nDabigatran, ticagrelor to help stop the clumping of platelets in the \n\ntreatment of patients with a history of a heart attack  \n\nNaloxegol to treat opioid induced constipation \n\nDapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation \n\nDomperidone to treat nausea and vomiting \n\n \n\nDo not combine darunavir with products that contain St John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Darunavir Mylan.  \n\n \n\nDarunavir is not a cure for HIV infection. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, \n\nalthough the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the \n\nprecautions needed to avoid infecting other people.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\nYou must keep in regular contact with your doctor.  \n\n \n\nPeople taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. Infrequently a rash may become severe or \n\npotentially life-threatening. Please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash.  \n\n \n\nIn patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for HIV infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) \n\nmay occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately.  \n\n \n\nTell your doctor about your situation BEFORE and DURING your treatment  \n\nMake sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C \ninfection. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can \n\ntake darunavir.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have diabetes. Darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood.  \n- Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged \n\nlymph nodes and fever). In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of \n\nopportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n\noccur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an \n\nimprovement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may \n\nhave been present with no obvious symptoms.  \n\n- In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when \nthe immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines \n\nfor the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after \n\nthe start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as \n\nmuscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of \n\nthe body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek \n\nnecessary treatment.  \n\n- Tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. Darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding.  \n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections).  \n- Tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. Some patients taking \n\ncombination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of \n\nbone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination \n\nantiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, \n\nhigher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing \n\nthis disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, \n\nknee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please \n\ninform your doctor. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nDarunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. If you belong to this \n\nage group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use Darunavir Mylan.  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDarunavir Mylan 800 mg tablets is not for use in children younger than 3 years of age or weighing less \n\nthan 40 kilograms. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Darunavir Mylan \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\n \n\nThere are some medicines that you must not combine with darunavir. These are mentioned above \n\nunder the heading \u2018Do not combine Darunavir Mylan with any of the following medicines:\u2019 \n\n \n\nIn most cases, darunavir can be combined with anti-HIV medicines belonging to another class [e.g. \n\nNRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \n\ninhibitors), CCR5 antagonists and FIs (fusion inhibitors)]. Darunavir with cobicistat or ritonavir has \n\nnot been tested with all PIs (protease inhibitors) and must not be used with other HIV PIs. In some \n\ncases dosage of other medicines might need to be changed. Therefore always tell your doctor if you \n\ntake other anti-HIV medicines and follow your doctor\u2019s instruction carefully on which medicines can \n\nbe combined.  \n\n \n\nThe effects of darunavir might be reduced if you take any of the following products.

or nurse before taking darunavir mylan. darunavir is not a cure for hiv infection. you can still pass on hiv when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. people taking darunavir may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with hiv infection. you must keep in regular contact with your doctor. people taking darunavir may develop a skin rash. infrequently a rash may become severe or potentially life-threatening. please contact your doctor whenever you develop a rash. in patients taking darunavir and raltegravir (for hiv infection), rashes (generally mild or moderate) may occur more frequently than in patients taking either medicine separately. tell your doctor about your situation before and during your treatment make sure that you check the following points and tell your doctor if any of these apply to you. - tell your doctor if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis b or c infection. your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take darunavir. - tell your doctor if you have diabetes. darunavir might increase sugar levels in the blood. - tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection (for example enlarged lymph nodes and fever). in some patients with advanced hiv infection and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-hiv treatment is started. it is believed that these symptoms are due to an 121 improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. - in addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. - tell your doctor if you have haemophilia. darunavir might increase the risk of bleeding. - tell your doctor if you are allergic to sulphonamides (e.g. used to treat certain infections). - tell your doctor if you notice any musculoskeletal problems. some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). the length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. if you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. elderly darunavir has only been used in limited numbers of patients 65 years or older. if you belong to this age group, please discuss with your doctor if you can use darunavir
