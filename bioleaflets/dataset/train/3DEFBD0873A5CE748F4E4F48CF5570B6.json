CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nKromeya in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: \n\n \n\n\u25aa the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response \nto disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate. \n\n\u25aa the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated \nwith methotrexate. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \n\ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray \n\nand to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. \n\n \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKromeya in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \n\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \n\nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kromeya can be given as \n\nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \n\ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \n\npatients aged less than 2 years. \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age \n\nand older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have \n\nhad an inadequate response to conventional therapy. \n\n \n\nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, \n\nwho have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the \n\nresponse to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate.  \n\nAdalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured \n\nby X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and to \n\nimprove physical function. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients \n\nwho are candidates for systemic therapy. \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \n\nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \n\ntherapy and phototherapies. \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult patients \n\nwho have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an \n\nimmunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \n\npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \n\nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \n\nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients \n\nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and \n\n6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \n\ncontraindications for such therapies. \n\n \n\nUveitis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult \n\npatients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of corticosteroid- \n\nsparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric Uveitis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \n\nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \n\nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nKromeya treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \n\ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Kromeya is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised \n\nto consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Kromeya (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients treated with Kromeya should be given the patient reminder card. \n\n \n\nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Kromeya if their physician \n\ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Kromeya, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \n\nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Kromeya for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \n\nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate should be \n\ncontinued during treatment with Kromeya. \n\n \n\nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \n\nduring treatment with Kromeya. Regarding combination with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs \n\nother than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1. \n\n \n\nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to Kromeya 40 mg every \n\nother week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg every \n\nother week. \n\n \n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \n\nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n\nKromeya may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n\n \n\nDose interruption \n\n \n\nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAvailable data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer \n\nresulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose \n\ninterruption. \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic \n\narthritis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Kromeya for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis \n\nwithout radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg adalimumab \n\nadministered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \n\nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Kromeya for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \n\nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \n\ninitial dose. \n\n \n\nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \n\nwithin this time period. \n\n \n\nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to Kromeya 40 mg every other week may benefit \n\nfrom an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and risks of \n\ncontinued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a \n\npatient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate response \n\nis achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently be \n\nreduced to 40 mg every other week. \n\nKromeya may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease \n\n \n\nThe recommended Kromeya induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely \n\nactive Crohn\u2019s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a \n\nmore rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one \n\nday or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg \n\ninjections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher during \n\ninduction. \n\n \n\nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \n\ninjection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped Kromeya and signs and symptoms of disease recur, \n\nKromeya may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after more than 8 \n\nweeks since the previous dose. \n\n \n\nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \n\nguidelines. \n\n \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Kromeya 40 mg every other week may \n\nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Kromeya every week or 80 mg every other week. \n\nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \n\nthrough week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \n\nwithin this time period. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKromeya may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis \n\n \n\nThe recommended Kromeya induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe \n\nulcerative colitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg \n\ninjections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in \n\none day). After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via \n\nsubcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \n\nguidelines. \n\n \n\nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to Kromeya 40 mg every other week may \n\nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg Kromeya every week or 80 mg every other week. \n\n \n\nAvailable data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. \n\nKromeya therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n\nKromeya may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n\n \n\nUveitis \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Kromeya for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, \n\nfollowed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited \n\nexperience in the initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with Kromeya can be \n\ninitiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory \n\nagents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two \n\nweeks after initiating treatment with Kromeya. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \n\nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n\nKromeya may be available in other presentations depending on the individual treatment needs. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nNo dose adjustment is required. \n\n \n\nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations.

Impaired lung function \n\nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \n\ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Kromeya. Because the \n\nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \n\nthis period. \n\n \n\nTreatment with Kromeya should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \n\nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis \n\nand patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \n\nKromeya should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Kromeya, should be monitored \n\nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Kromeya should be \n\ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or \n\nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise \n\ncaution when considering the use of Kromeya in patients with a history of recurring infection or with \n\nunderlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \n\nimmunosuppressive medications. \n\n \n\nSerious infections \n\n \n\nSerious infections including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \n\nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \n\npatients receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \n\nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \n\nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \n\ntuberculosis. \n\n \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with Kromeya, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n\n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \n\npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \n\nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \n\ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \n\nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient reminder card. \n\nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \n\nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n\n \n\nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Kromeya therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \n\nconsulted. \n\n \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \n\nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Kromeya, and in accordance with local \n\nrecommendations. \n\n \n\nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \n\nKromeya in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \n\ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \n\ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n\n \n\nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \n\npatients treated with adalimumab Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \n\ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \n\ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \n\nafter therapy with Kromeya. \n\n \n\nOther opportunistic infections \n\n \n\nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \n\nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF- \n\nantagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \n\noutcomes. \n\n \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \n\ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \n\nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Kromeya should be \n\npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \n\nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \n\nfungal infections. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \n\nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \n\noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Kromeya. For \n\npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \n\ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n\n \n\nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Kromeya should be closely monitored for signs and \n\nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \n\nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \n\nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \n\nwho develop HBV reactivation, Kromeya should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \n\nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nNeurological events \n\n \n\nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \n\nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \n\ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \n\ndisease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \n\nof Kromeya in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \n\ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Kromeya should be considered if any of these disorders \n\ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \n\ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \n\nuveitis prior to the initiation of Kromeya therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre- \n\nexisting or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\n \n\nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \n\nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials.Reports of serious \n\nallergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If \n\nan anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Kromeya should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n\n \n\nImmunosuppression \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \n\nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \n\nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B,- NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n\n \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n \n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \n\nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \n\npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \n\nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \n\ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \n\nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \n\nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n\n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \n\nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \n\ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \n\nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \n\ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \n\nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \n\nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \n\nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \n\ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or \n\n6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \n\nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Kromeya cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \n\ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional \n\ncaution should be exercised in considering Kromeya treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \n\nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\n\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Kromeya. Melanoma and Merkel cell \n\ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \n\nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \n\nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \n\nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \n\nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \n\nheavy smoking. \n\n \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \n\nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \n\ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \n\ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \n\ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \n\nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaematologic reactions \n\n \n\nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \n\nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \n\nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \n\nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n\n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Kromeya. Discontinuation of Kromeya \n\ntherapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \n\nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \n\nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \n\nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n\n \n\nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \n\nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \n\nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \n\nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \n\nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Kromeya should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Kromeya is contraindicated in moderate \n\nto severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Kromeya must be discontinued in patients who \n\ndevelop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\n \n\nAutoimmune processes \n\n \n\nTreatment with Kromeya may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-\n\nterm treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient \n\ndevelops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Kromeya and is \n\npositive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Kromeya should not be \n\ngiven (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists \n\n \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \n\nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \n\nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \n\ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \n\ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n\n \n\nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDs (e.g, anakinra and \n\nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \n\ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nSurgery \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \n\nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \n\npatient who requires surgery while on Kromeya should be closely monitored for infections, and \n\nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \n\narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nSmall bowel obstruction \n\n \n\nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \n\nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \n\nstrictures. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \n\nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \n\nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nSee Vaccinations above. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effects \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8  ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\n'sodium-free'. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \n\npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \n\nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \n\nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \n\nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe combination of Kromeya and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \n\nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n\n \n\nThe combination of Kromeya and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \n\nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child bearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \n\npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Kromeya treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \n\nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first \n\ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n\nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \n\ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \n\nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 \n\n(8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA \n\n(unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with \n\nCD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The \n\nadjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \n\ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the \n\nsecondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious \n\nor opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data \n\nmay be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-\n\nrandomized design. \n\n \n\nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \n\nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n\n(see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \n\nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \n\nneeded. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \n\nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \n\nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \n\nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \n\nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \n\nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \n\nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \n\nConsequently, Kromeya can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nKromeya may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \n\nimpairment may occur following administration of Kromeya (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nClinical studies in patients suffering hidradenitis suppurativa in this section are merely included for \n\npublic health reasons. However, please note that Kromeya is neither intended nor authorized for \n\ntreatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 \n\nmonths or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing \n\ndisease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related \n\narthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \n\nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \n\ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \n\ntreated patients. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \n\nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \n\naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body\u2019s defence against infection and cancer. \n\n \n\nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \n\nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \n\nreported with use of adalimumab. \n\n \n\nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \n\ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events \n\nand reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \n\nadult patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on \n\npostmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: \n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 \n\n1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Injection site reactions generally did not \n\nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \n\nthe adalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \n\npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \n\nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and 0.03 \n\nper patient year in placebo and active control\u2212treated patients. \n\n \n\nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n\n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \n\ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n\n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \n\npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \n\nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n\n \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n \n\nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years \n\nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \n\npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 \n\npatient years during a adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No \n\nmalignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an \n\nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n\n \n\nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \n\npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \n\nsuppurativa, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \n\nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n\n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 \n\npatient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \n\nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-\n\nmelanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients \n\nand 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell \n\ncarcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among \n\nadalimumab- treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The \n\nrate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among \n\nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. \n\n \n\nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \n\nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \n\npatient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma \n\nskin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin \n\ncancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is \n\napproximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \n\nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n\n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAutoantibodies \n\n \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \n\nstudies I - V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \n\nactive control \u2212 treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported \n\npositive titres at week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid \n\narthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like \n\nsyndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus \n\nnephritis or central nervous system symptoms. \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary events \n\n \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \n\nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n\n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients. \n\n \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x \n\nULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT \n\nelevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in the \n\nPhase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to \n\n<4 years. \n\n \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis with \n\na control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \n\nadalimumab- treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients. \n\n \n\nIn the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated \n\nefficacy and safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight \n\nadjusted induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% \n\n(5/192) of patients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline. \n\n \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period \n\nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-\n\ntreated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. \n\n \n\nNo ALT elevations \u2265 3 X ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \n\nplaque psoriasis. \n\n \n\nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed \n\nby 40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control \n\nperiod duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of \n\nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients. \n\n \n\nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \n\nweek starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 \n\ndays and 105.0 days in Adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \n\n\u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. \n\nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \n\nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post- \n\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, \n\nsuch as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn adult Crohn\u2019s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \n\nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \n\nwith adalimumab alone. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors, \n\nATC code: L04AB04 \n\n \n\nKromeya is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \n\ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \n\nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \n\nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n\n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \n\nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \n\nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \n\ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \n\nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n\n \n\nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis after treatment with adalimumab. In patients with \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the colon \n\nincluding a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \n\nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \n\nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \n\nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n\n \n\nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n\u2265 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \n\ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \n\nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n\n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n\u2265 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. \n\nDoses of 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with \n\nplacebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same \n\nduration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n\n \n\nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n\u2265 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \n\nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \n\nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \n\nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \n\nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \n\nan open- label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \n\nweek up to 10 years. \n\n \n\nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \n\narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\n\nrheumatic drug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \n\nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \n\nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \n\nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \n\nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \n\nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \n\nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \n\nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 \n\nweeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \n\nadministered every other week up to 10 years. \n\n \n\nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \n\npercentage of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in \n\nRA study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III \n\nand V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as \n\ndetected by X-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life. \n\n \n\nACR response \n\n \n\nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \n\nacross RA studies I, II and III.

Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \n\nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see Table 9). \n\n \n\nIn the open-label extension of RA study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \n\nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \n\nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically.

A modified \n\nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e., not identical to the TSS \n\nused for rheumatoid arthritis), was used. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with \n\nplacebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean \u00b1 SD) 0.8 \u00b1 2.5 in the placebo \n\ngroup (at week 24) compared with 0.0 \u00b1 1.9 (p< 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48). \n\n \n\nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 \n\n(n=102), 84% continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \n\nAdalimumab treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function \n\nas assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. \n\nImproved physical function continued during the open label extension up to week 136. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (\u2265 \n\n10% BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u2265 12 or \u2265 10) who were \n\ncandidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients \n\nenrolled in Psoriasis Studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety \n\nand efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque \n\npsoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a \n\nrandomised double-blind study (Psoriasis study III). \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \n\npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \n\nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \n\na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \n\nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \u2265PASI 75 \n\nresponse at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in period A, were re-randomised \n\nin period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. \n\nAcross all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician\u2019s \n\nGlobal Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53% of subjects included) to \u201csevere\u201d \n\n(41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate \n\nand placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter \n\ndose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab \n\nfollowed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are \n\nno data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving \n\nMTX who achieved a \u2265 PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. \n\nAcross all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score \n\nranged from \u201cmild\u201d (< 1%) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48%) to \u201csevere\u201d (46%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n\n \n\nPatients participating in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-\n\nlabel extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks. \n\n \n\nIn Psoriasis Studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI \n\n75 response from baseline at week 16 (see Tables 17 and 18). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 17 \n\nPs Study I (REVEAL) efficacy results at 16 weeks \n\n \n\n Placebo \n\nN=398 \n\nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=814 \n\nn (%) \n\n\uf0b3PASI 75\na\n 26 (6.5) 578 (70.9)\n\nb\n \n\nPASI 100 3 (0.8) 163 (20.0)\nb\n \n\nPGA: Clear/minimal 17 (4.3) 506 (62.2)\nb\n \n\na \nPercent of patients achieving PASI75 response was calculated as center- \n\nadjusted rate \nb \np<0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n\n \n\nTable 18 \n\nPs Study II (CHAMPION) efficacy results at 16 weeks \n\n \n\n Placebo \n\nN=53 \n\nn (%) \n\nMTX \n\nN=110 \n\nn (%) \n\nAdalimumab 40 mg eow \nN=108 \n\nn (%) \n\n\uf0b3PASI 75 10 (18.9) 39 (35.5) 86 (79.6) \na, b\n\n \n\nPASI 100 1 (1.9) 8 (7.3) 18 (16.7) \nc, d\n\n \n\nPGA: \n\nClear/minimal \n\n6 (11.3) 33 (30.0) 79 (73.1) \na, b\n\n \n\na \np<0.001 adalimumab vs. placebo \n\nb \np<0.001 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \n\nc \np<0.01 adalimumab vs. placebo \n\nd \np<0.05 adalimumab vs. methotrexate \n\n \n\nIn Psoriasis study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo \n\nat week 33 compared to 5% continuing on adalimumab, p<0.001, experienced \u201closs of adequate \n\nresponse\u201d (PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a <PASI 50 response \n\nrelative to baseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33). Of the \n\npatients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-\n\nlabel extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks \n\nof re-treatment, respectively. \n\n \n\nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \n\nfor 52 weeks in Psoriasis study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 \n\nand PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, \n\nafter an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all \n\npatients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, \n\nwere considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these \n\npatients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy \n\n(total of 160 weeks). \n\n \n\nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open- \n\nlabel extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a \n\nmedian time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of \n\nthese patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \n\npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after 16 \n\nweeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \n\nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal. \n\n \n\nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (Studies I and II) and MTX \n\n(study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In study I, improvements \n\nin the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \n\nplacebo. \n\n \n\nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 40 \n\nmg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \n\nachieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 72 \n\npatients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \n\nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \n\nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater \n\nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands \n\nand/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [p = 0.014]). \n\n \n\nPsoriasis study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \n\nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \n\nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \n\nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \n\nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of \n\nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see Table 19). \n\nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \n\ninvolvement (BSA  \u2265  10% (60% of patients) and BSA  <  10% and \u2265  5% (40% of patients)). \n\n \n\nTable 19 \n\nPs Study IV efficacy results at 16, 26 and 52 weeks \n\nEndpoint Week 16 \n\nplacebo-controlled \n\nWeek 26 \n\nplacebo-controlled \n\nWeek 52 \n\nopen-label \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n\n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=108 \n\nAdalimumab \n\n40 mg eow \n\nN=109 \n\nAdalimumab \n\n40 mg eow \n\nN=80 \n\n\u2265 mNAPSI 75 (%) 2.9 26.0a 3.4 46.6a 65.0 \n\nPGA-F clear/minimal and \n\n\u2265  2-grade improvement \n\n(%) \n\n2.9 29.7a 6.9 48.9a 61.3 \n\nPercent change in total \n\nfingernail NAPSI (%) \n\n-7.8 -44.2 a -11.5 -56.2a -72.2 \n\na p  <  0.001, adalimumab vs. placebo \n\n \n\nAdalimumab treated patients showed statistically significant improvements at week 26 compared with \n\nplacebo in the DLQI.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nThe efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 114 \n\npaediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA \u2265 4 \n\nor > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI \u2265 20 or \u2265 10 \n\nwith clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/ foot involvement) who were inadequately controlled \n\nwith topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPatients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg eow (up to 20 mg), or \n\nmethotrexate 0.1 \u2013 0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg).

In CD study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \n\nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 \n\nand 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week \n\n2. In CD study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised \n\nto receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The \n\nprimary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further \n\nevaluated. \n\n \n\nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 \n\npatients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were \n\nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n\n56 weeks.

Patients received placebo or \n\nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \n\nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n\n \n\nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \n\nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \n\nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \n\ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n\n \n\nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n\n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \n\na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was \n\ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \n\nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \n\nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n\n \n\nClinical Response \n\n \n\nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \n\nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 27).

Of the 371 \n\nremaining patients, 276 evaluable patients reached 78 weeks of open-label adalimumab treatment. \n\nBased on the observed data approach, 222 (80.4%) were in quiescence (no active inflammatory \n\nlesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose \u2264 7.5 mg per day, \n\nand 184 (66.7 %) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or maintained (< 5 \n\nletters deterioration) in 88.4% of the eyes at week 78. Among the patients who discontinued the study \n\nprior to week 78, 11% discontinued due to adverse events, and 5% due to insufficient response to \n\nadalimumab treatment. \n\n \n\nQuality of Life \n\n \n\nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \n\nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \n\nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \n\ntotal score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. Vision related \n\neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UVI and for colour \n\nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in study UV II. \n\n \n\nPediatric Uveitis \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled \n\nstudy of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious \n\nanterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received \n\neither placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week \n\nin combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \n\nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \n\ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \n\nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n\n \n\nClinical Response \n\n \n\nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 3, \n\nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \n\ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \n\ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \n\nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \n\nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure in the paediatric uveitis \n\nstudy \n\n \n\n \nTIME (WEEKS) \n\nTreatment     Placebo Adalimumab \n\nNote: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); A = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n \n\nImmunogenicity \n\n \n\nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment.

After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \n\nto 15 mL/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \n\nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \n\nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \n\narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 \u00b5g/mL \n\n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u00b5g/mL (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \n\nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \n\nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n\n \n\nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \n\nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \n\ntrough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 \u00b1 \n\n5.6 \u00b5g/mL (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u00b5g/mL \n\n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n\n \n\nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg \n\ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \n\nwas 6.0 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5g/mL (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 \u00b1 \n\n5.6 \u00b5g/mL (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n\n \n\nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \n\nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n\n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/mL for \n\nadalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg/mL with concomitant methotrexate. \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\n\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (\u00b1SD) trough steady-state concentration at \n\nWeek 68 was 8.0 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b5g/ml. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u00b5g/mL during \n\nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n\n \n\nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \n\nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state adalimumab \n\ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u00b5g/mL (79% CV). \n\n \n\nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \n\nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n\n5.5 \u00b5g/mL during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n\n80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n\n12 \u00b5g/mL during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u00b5g/mL \n\nwere observed in Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab \n\nevery other week. \n\n \n\nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n\n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \n\nAt week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n\n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \n\nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7\u00b16.6 \u00b5g/mL for patients \u2265 40 kg \n\n(160/80 mg) and 10.6\u00b16.1 \u00b5g/mL for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n\n \n\nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough \n\nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5\u00b15.6 \u00b5g/mL for the Standard Dose group and 3.5\u00b12.2 \u00b5g/mL for \n\nthe Low Dose group.

Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 \u00b5g/mL \n\nwere observed in ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab \n\nevery other week. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \n\nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \n\napproximately 8 to 10 \u00b5g/mL. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \n\nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n\n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \n\narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \n\nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \n\ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \n\npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \n\nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \n\npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n\n \n\nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n\n \n\nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \n\nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \n\nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \n\nresponse (EC50) was 3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n\n \n\nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \n\nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \n\nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \n\nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n\n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \n\nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \n\ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \n\nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower \n\nin patients with measurable AAA. \n\n \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \n\ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \n\nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \n\nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \n\nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralizing \n\nantibodies in rodents. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n \n\nKromeya in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \n\njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \n\nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kromeya can be given as \n\nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \n\ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \n\npatients aged less than 2 years. \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age \n\nand older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents \n\nfrom 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical \n\ntherapy and phototherapies. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric \n\npatients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \n\nprimary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or \n\nhave contraindications for such therapies. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Uveitis \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients \n\nfrom 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, \n\nor in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nKromeya treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \n\ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Kromeya is indicated. Ophthalmologists are advised \n\nto consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with Kromeya (see section 4.4). \n\nPatients treated with Kromeya should be given the patient reminder card. \n\n \n\nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Kromeya if their physician \n\ndetermines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. \n\n \n\nDuring treatment with Kromeya, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \n\nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of Kromeya for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 \n\nyears of age is based on body weight (Table 1). Kromeya is administered every other week via \n\nsubcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

Impaired lung function \n\nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \n\ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with Kromeya. Because the \n\nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \n\nthis period. \n\n \n\nTreatment with Kromeya should not be initiated in patients with active infections including chronic or \n\nlocalised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis \n\nand patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as \n\nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \n\nKromeya should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections). \n\n \n\nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Kromeya, should be monitored \n\nclosely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of Kromeya should be \n\ndiscontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial or \n\nantifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians should exercise \n\ncaution when considering the use of Kromeya in patients with a history of recurring infection or with \n\nunderlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant \n\nimmunosuppressive medications. \n\n \n\nSerious infections \n\n \n\nSerious infections including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \n\nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \n\npatients receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \n\nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis \n\n \n\nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \n\nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \n\ntuberculosis. \n\n \n\nBefore initiation of therapy with Kromeya, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n\n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of \n\npatient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \n\nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \n\ntest and chest X-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \n\nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the patient reminder card. \n\nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \n\nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised. \n\n \n\nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Kromeya therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \n\nconsulted. \n\n \n\nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \n\nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of Kromeya, and in accordance with local \n\nrecommendations. \n\n \n\nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \n\nKromeya in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for \n\ntuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \n\ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed. \n\n \n\nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \n\npatients treated with adalimumab Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \n\ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \n\ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \n\nafter therapy with Kromeya. \n\n \n\nOther opportunistic infections \n\n \n\nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \n\nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF- \n\nantagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \n\noutcomes. \n\n \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \n\ndyspnea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \n\nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Kromeya should be \n\npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \n\nfungal infections. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B reactivation \n\n \n\nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \n\nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \n\noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Kromeya. For \n\npatients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the \n\ntreatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n\n \n\nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Kromeya should be closely monitored for signs and \n\nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \n\nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \n\nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \n\nwho develop HBV reactivation, Kromeya should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \n\nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n\n \n\nNeurological events \n\n \n\nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \n\nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \n\ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \n\ndisease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \n\nof Kromeya in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \n\ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of Kromeya should be considered if any of these disorders \n\ndevelop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating \n\ndisorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious intermediate \n\nuveitis prior to the initiation of Kromeya therapy and regularly during treatment to assess for pre- \n\nexisting or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions \n\n \n\nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \n\nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials.Reports of serious \n\nallergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab administration. If \n\nan anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Kromeya should be \n\ndiscontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \n\n \n\nImmunosuppression \n\n \n\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \n\nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \n\nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B,- NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils. \n\n \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n \n\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \n\nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \n\npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have \n\nbeen reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \n\nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \n\ninflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible \n\nrisk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a \n\nTNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 22 \n\nyears of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \n\nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \n\ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \n\nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \n\ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \n\n \n\nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \n\nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \n\nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \n\nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \n\ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or \n\n6-mercaptopurine and adalimumab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \n\nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Kromeya cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \n\ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional \n\ncaution should be exercised in considering Kromeya treatment of these patients (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \n\nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non- \n\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Kromeya. Melanoma and Merkel cell \n\ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n\n(see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \n\nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \n\nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \n\nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \n\nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \n\nheavy smoking. \n\n \n\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \n\nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \n\ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \n\ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \n\ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \n\nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations. \n\n \n\nHaematologic reactions \n\n \n\nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \n\nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \n\nthrombocytopenia, leucopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \n\nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n\n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Kromeya. Discontinuation of Kromeya \n\ntherapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n\n \n\nVaccinations \n\n \n\nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \n\nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \n\nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \n\nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating adalimumab therapy. \n\n \n\nPatients on adalimumab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration \n\nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \n\nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nCongestive heart failure \n\n \n\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \n\nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \n\nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. Kromeya should be used with \n\ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Kromeya is contraindicated in moderate \n\nto severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with Kromeya must be discontinued in patients who \n\ndevelop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. \n\n \n\nAutoimmune processes \n\n \n\nTreatment with Kromeya may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \n\nlong- term treatment with adalimumab on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \n\npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Kromeya \n\nand is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Kromeya should \n\nnot be given (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists \n\n \n\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \n\nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of \n\nthe nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \n\ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \n\ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5). \n\nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDs (e.g, anakinra and \n\nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \n\ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section \n\n4.5). \n\n \n\nSurgery \n\n \n\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \n\nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \n\npatient who requires surgery while on Kromeya should be closely monitored for infections, and \n\nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \n\narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab. \n\n \n\nSmall bowel obstruction \n\n \n\nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \n\nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \n\nstrictures. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \n\nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \n\nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nSee Vaccinations above. \n\n \n\nExcipients with known effects \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8  ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\n'sodium-free'. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \n\npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \n\nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \n\nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \n\nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n\n \n\nThe combination of Kromeya and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \n\nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n\n \n\nThe combination of Kromeya and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \n\nadministration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of child bearing potential \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \n\npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last Kromeya treatment. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \n\nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first \n\ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n\nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \n\ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \n\nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \n\nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 \n\n(8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA \n\n(unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with \n\nCD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The \n\nadjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \n\ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the \n\nsecondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious \n\nor opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data \n\nmay be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-\n\nrandomized design. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \n\nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n\n(see section 5.3). \n\n \n\nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \n\nimmune responses in the newborn. Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \n\nneeded. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \n\nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \n\nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \n\nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \n\nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \n\nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \n\nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \n\nConsequently, Kromeya can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nKromeya may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \n\nimpairment may occur following administration of Kromeya (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nClinical studies in patients suffering hidradenitis suppurativa in this section are merely included for \n\npublic health reasons. However, please note that Kromeya is neither intended nor authorized for \n\ntreatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 \n\nmonths or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing \n\ndisease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related \n\narthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without \n\nradiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \n\nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \n\nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \n\nperiod. \n\n \n\nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \n\ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \n\ntreated patients. \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \n\nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \n\nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as adalimumab \n\naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body\u2019s defence against infection and cancer. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \n\nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \n\nreported with use of adalimumab. \n\n \n\nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \n\ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events \n\nand reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \n\nadult patients. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on \n\npostmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in Table 6 below: \n\nvery common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 \n\n1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

pain or swelling), compared \n\nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \n\nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\n \n\nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \n\nthe adalimumab treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \n\npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \n\nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved. \n\n \n\nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab treated patients and 0.03 \n\nper patient year in placebo and active control \u2212 treated patients. \n\n \n\nIn controlled and open label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n\n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \n\ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n\n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, ,blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \n\nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. \n\n \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \n\n \n\nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient years \n\nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \n\npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient years during adalimumab trials in paediatric patients with \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 \n\npatient years during a adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No \n\nmalignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an \n\nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n\n \n\nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \n\npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \n\nsuppurativa, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \n\nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n\n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 \n\npatient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \n\nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-\n\nmelanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients \n\nand 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell \n\ncarcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among \n\nadalimumab- treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The \n\nrate (95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among \n\nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. \n\n \n\nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open label extension \n\nstudies with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients and over 26,439 \n\npatient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and non-melanoma \n\nskin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient years. The observed rate of non-melanoma skin \n\ncancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient years, and the observed rate of lymphomas is \n\napproximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient years. \n\n \n\nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \n\nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n\n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \n\nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAutoantibodies \n\n \n\nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \n\nstudies I \u2212 V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and \n\nactive control \u2212 treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported \n\npositive titres at week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid \n\narthritis and psoriatic arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like \n\nsyndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus \n\nnephritis or central nervous system symptoms. \n\n \n\nHepato-biliary events \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \n\nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n\n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients. \n\n \n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x \n\nULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT \n\nelevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors, \n\nATC code: L04AB04 \n\n \n\nKromeya is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its \n\ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. \n\n \n\nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \n\nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \n\nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM). \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n\n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \n\nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \n\nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \n\ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with Adalimumab \n\nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation. \n\n \n\nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis after treatment with adalimumab. In patients with \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing inflammatory markers in the colon \n\nincluding a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. Endoscopic studies in intestinal \n\nmucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab treated patients. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \n\nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \n\ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended \n\noligoarthritis). \n\n \n\npJIA I \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \n\nparallel \u2212 group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \n\nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX- \n\ntreated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of \n\nNSAIDs and or prednisone (\u2264 0.2 mg /kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients \n\nreceived 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The \n\ndistribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI \n\nphase is presented in Table 7. \n\n \n\nTable 7 \n\nDistribution of patients by age and adalimumab dose received during the OL LI phase \n\n \n\nAge Group Number of patients at Baseline  \n\nn (%) \n\nMinimum, median and maximum \n\ndose \n\n4 to 7 years 31 (18.1) 10, 20 and 25 mg \n\n8 to 12 years 71 (41.5) 20, 25 and 40 mg \n\n13 to 17 years 69 (40.4) 25, 40 and 40 mg \n\n \n\nPatients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into \n\nthe double blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or \n\nplacebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were \n\ndefined as a worsening of \u2265 30% from baseline in \u2265 3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, \u2265 2 active \n\njoints, and improvement of \u2265 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \n\ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer. \n\n \n\nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with \n\nthe combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \n\nconsideration, Kromeya is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \n\nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\npJIA II \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 children \n\n(2 - <4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \n\npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \n\nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \n\nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \n\nNSAIDs. \n\n \n\nAt week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \n\ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n\n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded (Pediatric \n\nACR 30) at week 24 (n=27 out of 30 patients), the Pediatric ACR 30 responses were maintained for up \n\nto 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this time period. \n\nOverall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n\n \n\nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomised, double-blind study \n\nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \n\nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n\n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-\n\nlabel (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n\n40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was \n\nthe percent change from Baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not \n\ndue to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with \n\nmean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the adalimumab \n\ngroup compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. \n\nImprovement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through \n\nweek 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. \n\nAlthough not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in \n\nsecondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count \n\n(SJC), Pediatric ACR 50 response, and Pediatric ACR 70 response. \n\n \n\nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The efficacy \n\nand safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled studies. \n\nSome patients were treated for up to 120 months duration. \n\n \n\nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n\u2265 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \n\ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \n\nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n\n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n\u2265 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. \n\nDoses of 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with \n\nplacebo on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same \n\nduration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed. \n\n \n\nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\n\u2265 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \n\nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \n\nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \n\nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \n\nplacebo injections on alternate weeks.

Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\n\nrheumatic drug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \n\nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \n\nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \n\nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks. \n\n \n\nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \n\nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \n\nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \n\nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \n\nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 \n\nweeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \n\nadministered every other week up to 10 years. \n\n \n\nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \n\npercentage of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in \n\nRA study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III \n\nand V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as \n\ndetected by X-ray results).

Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \n\ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \n\nreceive at least one of these medications. \n\n \n\nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD study I \n\n(CLASSIC I) and CD study II (GAIN). In CD study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naive patients were \n\nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 \n\nand 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week \n\n2. In CD study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised \n\nto receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The \n\nprimary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further \n\nevaluated. \n\n \n\nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 \n\npatients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were \n\nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n\n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u2265 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed \n\nseparately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week \n\n8. \n\n \n\nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in Table 20. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 20 \n\nInduction of clinical remission and response  \n\n(percent of patients) \n\n \n\n CD study I: infliximab naive patients CD study II: infliximab \n\nexperienced patients \n\n \nPlacebo \n\nN=74 \n\nAdalimumab \n\n80/40 mg \n\nN = 75 \n\nAdalimumab \n\n160/80 mg \n\nN=76 \n\nPlacebo \n\nN=166 \n\nAdalimumab \n\n160/80 mg \n\nN=159 \n\nWeek 4      \n\nClinical remission 12% 24% 36%* 7% 21%* \n\nClinical response \n\n(CR- 100) 24% 37% 49%** 25% 38%** \n\nAll p-values are pairwise comparisons of proportions for adalimumab versus placebo \n\n* p < 0.001 \n\n** p < 0.01 \n\n \n\nSimilar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 \n\nand adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group. \n\n \n\nIn CD study III, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in \n\nthe primary analysis.

Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 233 \n\npatients, respectively. \n\n \n\nQuality of life \n\n \n\nIn CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \n\ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients \n\nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 \n\nand 56 in CD study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo \n\ngroup. \n\n \n\nPediatric Uveitis \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomized, double-masked, controlled \n\nstudy of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious \n\nanterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received \n\neither placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week \n\nin combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n\n \n\nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \n\nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \n\ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \n\nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n\n \n\nClinical Response \n\n \n\nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (See Figure 1, \n\nP < 0.0001 from log rank test).The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \n\ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \n\ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \n\nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \n\nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier curves summarizing time to treatment failure in the paediatric uveitis \n\nstudy \n\n \n\n \nTIME (WEEKS) \n\nTreatment     Placebo Adalimumab \n\nNote: P = Placebo (number at risk); A = Adalimumab (number at risk). \n \n\nAdult Uveitis \n\n \n\nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \n\nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \n\nrandomised, double- masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \n\nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \n\nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n\n \n\nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \n\nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2-week standardised dose of \n\nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \n\ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n\n \n\nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n\n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \n\na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u00b4time to treatment failure\u00b4. Treatment failure was \n\ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \n\nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \n\nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n\nP\nR\n\nO\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nIL\nIT\n\nY\n O\n\nF\n F\n\nA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nT\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n \n\nA \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nClinical Response \n\n \n\nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \n\nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (See Table 22).

The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \n\nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7\u00b16.6 \u00b5g/mL for patients \u2265 40 kg \n\n(160/80 mg) and 10.6\u00b16.1 \u00b5g/mL for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg). \n\n \n\nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough \n\nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5\u00b15.6 \u00b5g/mL for the Standard Dose group and 3.5\u00b12.2 \u00b5g/mL for \n\nthe Low Dose group.

No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \n\nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \n\ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n\nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n\nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \n\nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \n\nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \n\nresponse (EC50) was 3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n\nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric \n\npatients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or \n\nminimal, respectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \n\nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 \n\nand 1.9-10.5, respectively). \n\n \n\nAdults \n\n \n\nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \n\nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \n\naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \n\nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \n\nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 \n\nto 15 mL/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \n\nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \n\nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum. \n\n \n\nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \n\narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 \u00b5g/mL \n\n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u00b5g/mL (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \n\nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \n\nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u00b5g/mL during  \n\nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \n\nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n\n5.5 \u00b5g/mL during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n\n80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n\n12 \u00b5g/mL during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u00b5g/mL \n\nwere observed in Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab \n\nevery other week. \n\n \n\nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \n\nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \n\napproximately 8 to 10 \u00b5g/mL. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \n\npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \n\nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \n\npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \n\nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \n\ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \n\nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be lower \n\nin patients with measurable AAA. \n\n \n\nHepatic or renal impairment \n\n \n\nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \n\nrepeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\n \n\nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \n\ncynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \n\nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \n\nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \n\nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralizing \n\nantibodies in rodents. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Instructions for use \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Kromeya is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nKromeya contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n\n(defence) system.  \n\n \n\nKromeya is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n\u2022 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,  \n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis,  \n\u2022 ankylosing spondylitis,  \n\u2022 axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis,  \n\u2022 psoriatic arthritis,  \n\u2022 psoriasis,  \n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease,  \n\u2022 ulcerative colitis and  \n\u2022 non-infectious uveitis  \n \n\nThe active ingredient in Kromeya, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \n\nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.   \n\n \n\nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \n\nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Kromeya blocks its \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naction and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \n\nIf these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Kromeya to treat your rheumatoid \n\narthritis. \n\n \n\nKromeya can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \n\nmethotrexate treatment. \n\n \n\nKromeya can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \n\nimprove physical function. \n\n \n\nUsually, Kromeya is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is \n\ninappropriate, Kromeya can be given alone. \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \n\nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to \n\n17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \n\nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \n\nwork well enough, patients will be given Kromeya to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \n\nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Kromeya to reduce the signs \n\nand symptoms of your disease. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Kromeya can slow down the damage to the \n\ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \n\ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \n\nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \n\ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Kromeya is also used to treat \n\nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines \n\napplied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Kromeya to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \n\ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Kromeya to \n\nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation \n\nleads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \n\nmove across the field of vision). Kromeya works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat: \n\n\u2022 adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye  \n\n\u2022 children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \nfront of the eye. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Kromeya  \n\n \n\nDo not use Kromeya \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\n- if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other \n\nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired, dental problems (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\n- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Kromeya \n\n \n\nAllergic reaction \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \nswelling or rash do not inject more Kromeya and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \n\ncases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInfection \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting Kromeya. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Kromeya treatment. This risk may \nincrease if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include \n\ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual \n\ninfectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-\n\nthreatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Kromeya. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis (TB) \n\n \n\n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Kromeya. This will \n\ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for \n\nexample chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \n\nrecorded on your patient reminder card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have \n\never had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \n\ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, \n\nlistlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nTravel/recurrent infection \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the \nrisk of infections. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B virus \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you \n\nfor HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some \n\nrare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, \n\nreactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nAge over 65 years \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Kromeya. You \nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \n\nwith Kromeya. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as \n\nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\nSurgery or dental procedures \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking \nKromeya. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Kromeya. \n\n \n\nDemyelinating disease \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \n\nto receive Kromeya. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \n\nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \n\nVaccine \n\n \n\n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and \nshould not be given during treatment with Kromeya in case they cause infections. Check with \n\nyour doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \n\ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Kromeya. If \n\nyou receive Kromeya while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is \n\nimportant that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nKromeya use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any \n\nvaccine. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Kromeya, your heart failure status must be \n\nclosely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n\n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \n\nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n\n \n\n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \n\nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nCancer \n\n \n\n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \n\nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma  and \n\nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Kromeya the risk of \n\ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and \n\nsevere type of lymphoma, has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \n\npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \n\nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Kromeya. \n\n  \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \n\nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 \n\nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \n\nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \n\n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Kromeya could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \nKromeya. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Kromeya to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of \n2 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe or 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are \nrecommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Kromeya \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n\n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \n\npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \n\nYou should not take Kromeya with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \n\ndue to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \n\nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \n\nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \n\nhave questions, please ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for \n\nadvice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nYou are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using \n\nKromeya and for at least 5 months after the last Kromeya injection. If you become pregnant, you \n\nshould see your doctor. \n\n \n\nKromeya should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\n \n\nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \n\nreceive adalimumab. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nIf you receive Kromeya during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about \n\nyour Kromeya use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information \n\nsee section on vaccination). \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nKromeya may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \n\nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Kromeya. \n\n \n\nKromeya contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

What Kromeya is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nKromeya contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n\n(defence) system. \n\n \n\nKromeya is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n\u2022 rheumatoid arthritis, \n\n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \n\n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis, \n\n\u2022 ankylosing spondylitis, \n\n\u2022 axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, \n\n\u2022 psoriatic arthritis, \n\n\u2022 psoriasis, \n\n\u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease, \n\n\u2022 ulcerative colitis and \n\n\u2022 non-infectious uveitis \n \n\nThe active ingredient in Kromeya, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \n\nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.   \n\n  \n\nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \n\nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Kromeya blocks its \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\naction and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis \n\n \n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \n\nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \n\nIf these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Kromeya to treat your rheumatoid \n\narthritis. \n\n \n\nKromeya can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without previous \n\nmethotrexate treatment. \n\n \n\nKromeya can slow down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \n\nimprove physical function. \n\n \n\nUsually, Kromeya is used with methotrexate. If your doctor considers that methotrexate is \n\ninappropriate, Kromeya can be given alone. \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \n\nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and adolescents aged 2 to \n\n17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Patients may \n\nfirst be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines do not \n\nwork well enough, patients will be given Kromeya to treat their polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \n\narthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis \n\n \n\nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \n\nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used in adults to treat these conditions. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \n\nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \n\nmedicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Kromeya to reduce the signs \n\nand symptoms of your disease. \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis \n\n \n\nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints associated with psoriasis. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. Kromeya can slow down the damage to the \n\ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and improve physical function. \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin \n\ncovered with silvery scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, \n\nbecome thickened and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be \n\ncaused by a problem with the body\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin \n\ncells. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Kromeya is also used to treat \n\nsevere plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom medicines \n\napplied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \n\nmedicines, you will be given Kromeya to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease. \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis \n\n \n\nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \n\ngiven other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, you will be given Kromeya to \n\nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation \n\nleads to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines that \n\nmove across the field of vision). Kromeya works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat: \n\n\u2022 adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye  \n\n\u2022 children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the \nfront of the eye. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Kromeya  \n\n \n\nDo not use Kromeya \n\n \n\n- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\n- if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other \n\nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired, dental problems (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\n- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \n\nhave a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Kromeya \n\n \n\nAllergic reaction \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \nswelling or rash do not inject more Kromeya and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare \n\ncases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInfection \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting Kromeya. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u2022 You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Kromeya treatment. This risk may \nincrease if your lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include \n\ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual \n\ninfectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-\n\nthreatening. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Kromeya. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis (TB) \n\n \n\n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Kromeya. This will \n\ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for \n\nexample chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \n\nrecorded on your patient reminder card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you have \n\never had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had \n\ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative \n\ntreatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, \n\nlistlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor \n\nimmediately. \n\n \n\nTravel/recurrent infection \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the \nrisk of infections. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B virus \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \ninfection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you \n\nfor HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry this virus. In some \n\nrare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, \n\nreactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nAge over 65 years \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking Kromeya. You \nand your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated \n\nwith Kromeya. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as \n\nfever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\nSurgery or dental procedures \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking \nKromeya. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Kromeya. \n\n \n\nDemyelinating disease \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 If you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around \nthe nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue \n\nto receive Kromeya. Tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your \n\nvision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \n\nVaccine \n\n \n\n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and \nshould not be given during treatment with Kromeya in case they cause infections. Check with \n\nyour doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that, if possible, children be \n\ngiven all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with Kromeya. If \n\nyou receive Kromeya while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is \n\nimportant that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nKromeya use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any \n\nvaccine. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. If you have \nmild heart failure and you are being treated with Kromeya, your heart failure status must be \n\nclosely monitored by your doctor. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure \n\n(e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately.  \n\n \n\nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n\n \n\n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or \nhelp you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed \n\nvery easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to stop \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nCancer \n\n \n\n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \n\nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma  and \n\nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If you take Kromeya the risk of \n\ngetting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and \n\nsevere type of lymphoma, has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some of those \n\npatients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if \n\nyou are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Kromeya. \n\n  \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \n\nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 \n\nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \n\nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. \n\n \n\n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Kromeya could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \nKromeya. \n\n\u2022 Do not give Kromeya to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of \n2 years. \n\n\u2022 Do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe or 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are \nrecommended. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Kromeya \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n\n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \n\npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \n\nYou should not take Kromeya with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept \n\ndue to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \n\nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \n\nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. If you \n\nhave questions, please ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for \n\nadvice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nYou are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using \n\nKromeya and for at least 5 months after the last Kromeya injection. If you become pregnant, you \n\nshould see your doctor. \n\n \n\nKromeya should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\n \n\nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \n\nreceive adalimumab. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nIf you receive Kromeya during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about \n\nyour Kromeya use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information \n\nsee section on vaccination). \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nKromeya may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \n\nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Kromeya. \n\n \n\nKromeya contains sodium \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

Instructions for use \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Kromeya is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nKromeya contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body\u2019s immune \n\n(defence) system. \n\n \n\nKromeya is intended for the treatment of the following inflammatory diseases: \n\n\u2022 polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\n\u2022 enthesitis-related arthritis \n\n\u2022 paediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n\u2022 paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease \n\n\u2022 paediatric uveitis \n \n\nThe active ingredient in Kromeya, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are \n\nproteins that attach to a specific target in the body.   \n\n \n\nThe target of adalimumab is another protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is present at \n\nincreased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. By attaching to TNF\u03b1, Kromeya blocks its \n\naction and reduces the inflammation in these diseases. \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of \n\nthe joints that usually first appear in childhood. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis. Your \n\nchild may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. If these medicines \n\ndo not work well enough, your child will be given Kromeya to treat his/her polyarticular juvenile \n\nidiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis. \n\n \n\nPaediatric plaque psoriasis \n\n \n\nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \n\nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift \n\naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the \n\nbody\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for \n\nwhom medicines applied to the skin and treatment with UV light have either not worked very well or \n\nare not suitable. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Crohn's disease \n\n \n\nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the gut. \n\n \n\nKromeya is indicated for the treatment of Crohn's disease in children aged 6 to 17 years. Your child \n\nmay first be given other medicines. If these medicines do not work well enough, your child will be \n\ngiven Kromeya to reduce the signs and symptoms of his/her disease. \n\n \n\nPaediatric uveitis \n\n \n\nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye. The inflammation \n\nmay lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black dots or wispy lines \n\nthat move across the field of vision). Kromeya works by reducing this inflammation. \n\n \n\nKromeya is used to treat children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with \n\ninflammation affecting the front of the eye.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before your child uses Kromeya  \n\n \n\nDo not use Kromeya \n\n \n\n- if your child is allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n \n\n- if your child has a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other \n\nopportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). It is \n\nimportant that you tell your doctor if your child has symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \n\nfeeling tired, dental problems (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\n- if your child has moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if your child \n\nhas had or has a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\n \n\nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist before using Kromeya \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n163 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAllergic reaction \n\n \n\n\u2022 If your child experiences allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, \ndizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more Kromeya and contact your doctor immediately \n\nsince, in rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n\n \n\nInfection \n\n \n\n\u2022 If your child has an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting Kromeya. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Your child might get infections more easily while receiving Kromeya treatment. This risk may \nincrease if his/her lung function is reduced. These infections may be more serious and include \n\ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual \n\ninfectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). In rare cases, these infections may be life-\n\nthreatening. It is important to tell your doctor if your child gets symptoms such as fever, \n\nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping \n\nKromeya. \n\n \n\nTuberculosis (TB) \n\n \n\n\u2022 As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \nwill check your child for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Kromeya. This will \n\ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your child\u2019s medical history and screening tests \n\n(for example chest X-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests should be \n\nrecorded on your child\u2019s patient reminder card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if \n\nyour child has ever had tuberculosis, or if he/she has been in close contact with someone who \n\nhas had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if your child has had \n\npreventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight \n\nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your \n\ndoctor immediately. \n\n \n\nTravel/recurrent infection \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child has lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child has a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that \nincrease the risk of infections. \n\n \n\nHepatitis B virus \n\n \n\n\u2022 Tell your doctor if your child is a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if he/she has active \nHBV infection or if you think he/she might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your child\u2019s doctor \n\nshould test your child for HBV. Adalimumab can reactivate HBV infection in people who carry \n\nthis virus. In some rare cases, especially if your child is taking other medicines that suppress the \n\nimmune system, reactivation of HBV infection can be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nSymptoms of infections \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if your child gets symptoms of infections, such as fever, \nwounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n\nSurgery or dental procedures \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n164 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 If your child is about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that he/she is taking \nKromeya. Your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping Kromeya. \n\n \n\nDemyelinating disease \n\n \n\n\u2022 If your child has or develops a demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer \naround the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if he/she should receive \n\nor continue to receive Kromeya. Tell your doctor immediately if your child gets symptoms like \n\nchanges in vision, weakness in arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of the body. \n\n \n\nVaccine \n\n \n\n\u2022 Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of bacteria or disease-causing bacteria or \nviruses and should not be given during treatment with Kromeya in case they cause infections. \n\nCheck with your doctor before your child receives any vaccines. It is recommended that, if \n\npossible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start \n\ntreatment with Kromeya. If you receive Kromeya while you are pregnant, your baby may be at \n\nhigher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose you received \n\nduring pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care \n\nprofessionals about your Kromeya use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your \n\nbaby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\n \n\n\u2022 It is important to tell your doctor if your child has had or has a serious heart condition. If your \nchild has mild heart failure and is being treated with Kromeya, his/her heart failure status must \n\nbe closely monitored by your doctor. If he/she develops new or worsening symptoms of heart \n\nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of his/her feet), you must contact your doctor \n\nimmediately. Your doctor will decide if your child should receive Kromeya. \n\n \n\nFever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale \n\n \n\n\u2022 In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your child's \nbody fight off infections or help him/her to stop bleeding. If your child develops a fever that \n\ndoes not go away, bruises or bleeds very easily or looks very pale, call your doctor right away. \n\nYour doctor may decide to stop treatment. \n\n \n\nCancer \n\n \n\n\u2022 There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking \nadalimumab or other TNF\u03b1 blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have \n\nhad the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and \n\nleukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). If your child takes Kromeya the \n\nrisk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. On rare occasions, a \n\nspecific and severe type of lymphoma, has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. Some \n\nof those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. Tell your \n\ndoctor if your child is taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with Kromeya.  \n\n \n\n\u2022 In addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking \nadalimumab. If new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks \n\nor areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n\n\u2022 There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with another TNF\u03b1 \n\nblocker. If your child has COPD, or is a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \n\nwhether treatment with a TNF\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for your child. \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n \n\n165 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 On rare occasions, treatment with Kromeya could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact your \ndoctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Kromeya \n\n \n\nTell your child\u2019s doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any \n\nother medicines. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents \n\n(sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or \n\npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n\n \n\nYour child should not take Kromeya with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or \n\nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. The combination of adalimumab as well as other \n\nTNF-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk \n\nfor infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.If you \n\nhave questions, please ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you think your child may be pregnant or is planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n\nfor advice before they use this medicine. \n\n \n\nYour child is advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using \n\nKromeya and for at least 5 months after the last Kromeya injection. If your child becomes pregnant, \n\nyou should see your child\u2019s doctor. \n\n \n\nKromeya should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\n \n\nAccording to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not \n\nreceive adalimumab. \n\n \n\nKromeya can be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nIf your child received Kromeya during her pregnancy, her baby may have a higher risk for getting an \n\ninfection. It is important that you tell her baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about her \n\nKromeya use during her pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see \n\nsection on vaccination). \n\n \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nKromeya may have a minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room spinning \n\nsensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking Kromeya. \n\n \n\nKromeya contains sodium  \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially \n\n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n\n \n\n3.

know before you use kromeya", "Section_Content": "do not use kromeya - if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). - if you have a severe infection, including tuberculosis, sepsis (blood poisoning) or other opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system). it is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems (see \"warnings and precautions\"). - if you have moderate or severe heart failure. it is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see \"warnings and precautions\"). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using kromeya allergic reaction if you have allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more kromeya and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. infection if you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting kromeya. if you are unsure, contact your doctor. you might get infections more easily while you are receiving kromeya treatment. this risk may increase if your lung function is reduced. these infections may be more serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other unusual infectious organisms and sepsis (blood poisoning). in rare cases, these infections may be life- threatening. it is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping kromeya. tuberculosis (tb) as cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting kromeya. this will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and screening tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). the conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your patient reminder card. it is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have had preventative treatment for tuberculosis. if symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately. travel/recurrent infection tell your doctor if you have lived or travelled in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are common. tell your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections. hepatitis b virus tell your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis b virus (hbv), if you have active hbv infection or if you think you might be at risk of contracting hbv. your doctor should test you for hbv. adalimumab can reactivate hbv infection in people who carry this virus. in some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of hbv infection can be life-threatening. age over 65 years if you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking kromeya. you and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with kromeya. it is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. surgery or dental procedures if you are about to have surgery or dental procedures tell your doctor that you are taking kromeya. your doctor may recommend temporarily stopping kromeya. demyelinating disease 114 if you have or develop demyelinating disease (a disease that affects the insulating layer around the nerves, such as multiple sclerosis), your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to receive kromeya. tell your doctor immediately if you get symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. vaccine certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses and should not be given during treatment with kromeya in case they cause infections. check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. it is recommended that, if possible, children be given all the scheduled vaccinations for their age before they start treatment with kromeya. if you receive kromeya while you are pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection for up to about five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your kromeya use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. heart failure it is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. if you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with kromeya, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. if you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale in some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that fight off infections or help you to stop bleeding. if you develop a fever that does not go away, or you bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. your doctor may decide to stop treatment. cancer there have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adults taking adalimumab or other tnf\u03b1 blockers. people with more serious rheumatoid arthritis who have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma and leukaemia (cancers that affect blood cells and bone marrow). if you take kromeya the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. on rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma, has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. some of those patients were also treated with the medicines azathioprine or mercaptopurine. tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or mercaptopurine with kromeya. in addition cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. if new areas of damaged skin appear during or after treatment or if existing marks or areas of damage change appearance, tell your doctor. there have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma, in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) treated with another tnf\u03b1 blocker. if you have copd, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a tnf\u03b1 blocker is appropriate for you. on rare occasions, treatment with kromeya could result in lupus-like syndrome. contact your doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. children and adolescents 115 vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using kromeya. do not give kromeya to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years. do not use the 40 mg pre-filled syringe or 40 mg pre-filled pen if doses other than 40 mg are recommended. other medicines and kromeya tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. kromeya can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), corticosteroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). you should not take kromeya with medicines containing the active substances anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. the combination of adalimumab as well as other tnf-antagonists and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. if you have questions, please ask your doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and must use adequate contraception while using kromeya and for at least 5 months after the last kromeya injection. if you become pregnant, you should see your doctor. kromeya should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. according to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received adalimumab during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive adalimumab. kromeya can be used during breast-feeding. if you receive kromeya during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your kromeya use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine (for more information see section on vaccination). driving and using machines kromeya may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. room spinning sensation (vertigo) and vision disturbances may occur after taking kromeya. kromeya contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "kromeya", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset":
