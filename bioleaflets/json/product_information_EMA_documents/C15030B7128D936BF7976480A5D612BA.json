PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nIvabradine JensonR 5 mg film-coated tablets \nPink colour, oval shape, biconvex film-coated scored tablets, approximately 7.9 mm by 4.15 mm debossed \nwith “Ι 5” on one side and “M” on other side of the tablet. \n \nThe tablet can be divided into equal doses. \n \nIvabradine JensonR 7.5 mg film-coated tablets \nPink colour, round, beveled edge, biconvex film-coated tablets, approximately 6.65 mm in diameter \ndebossed with “Ι 7” on one side and “M” on other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris \nIvabradine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in coronary artery \ndisease adults with normal sinus rhythm and heart rate ≥70 bpm. Ivabradine is indicated: \n- in adults unable to tolerate or with a contraindication to the use of beta-blockers \n- or in combination with beta-blockers in patients inadequately controlled with an optimal beta-blocker \n\ndose. \n \nTreatment of chronic heart failure \nIvabradine is indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class with systolic dysfunction, in patients in \nsinus rhythm and whose heart rate is ≥75 bpm, in combination with standard therapy including beta-blocker \ntherapy or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated (see section 5.1). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nFor the different doses, film-coated tablets containing 5 mg and 7.5 mg ivabradine are available. \n \nSymptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris \nIt is recommended that the decision to initiate or titrate treatment takes place with the availability of serial \nheart rate measurements, ECG or ambulatory 24-hour monitoring. \nThe starting dose of ivabradine should not exceed 5 mg twice daily in patients aged below 75 years. After \nthree to four weeks of treatment, if the patient is still symptomatic, if the initial dose is well tolerated and if \nresting heart rate remains above 60 bpm, the dose may be increased to the next higher dose in patients \nreceiving 2.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. The maintenance dose should not exceed 7.5 mg twice \ndaily. \n \nIf there is no improvement in symptoms of angina within 3 months after start of treatment, treatment of \nivabradine should be discontinued. \nIn addition, discontinuation of treatment should be considered if there is only limited symptomatic response \nand when there is no clinically relevant reduction in resting heart rate within three months. \nIf, during treatment, heart rate decreases below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the patient experiences \nsymptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated \ndownward including the lowest dose of 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily). After dose \nreduction, heart rate should be monitored (see section 4.4). Treatment must be discontinued if heart rate \nremains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist despite dose reduction. \n \nTreatment of chronic heart failure \nThe treatment has to be initiated only in patient with stable heart failure. It is recommended that the treating \nphysician should be experienced in the management of chronic heart failure. \nThe usual recommended starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily. After two weeks of treatment, the \ndose can be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily if resting heart rate is persistently above 60 bpm or decreased to \n2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily) if resting heart rate is persistently below 50 bpm or in \ncase of symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension. If heart rate is between 50 \nand 60 bpm, the dose of 5 mg twice daily should be maintained. \nIf during treatment, heart rate decreases persistently below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the patient \nexperiences symptoms related to bradycardia, the dose must be titrated downward to the next lower dose in \npatients receiving 7.5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. If heart rate increases persistently above 60 beats \nper minute at rest, the dose can be up titrated to the next upper dose in patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily \nor 5 mg twice daily. \nTreatment must be discontinued if heart rate remains below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nIn patients aged 75 years or more, a lower starting dose should be considered (2.5 mg twice daily i.e. one \nhalf 5 mg tablet twice daily) before up-titration if necessary. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance above 15 ml/min \n(see section 5.2). \nNo data are available in patients with creatinine clearance below 15 ml/min. Ivabradine should therefore be \nused with precaution in this population. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nHepatic impairment   \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when \nusing ivabradine in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Ivabradine is contraindicated for use in \npatients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since it has not been studied in this population and a large increase \nin systemic exposure is anticipated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population  \nThe safety and efficacy of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure in children aged below \n18 years have not been established. \nAvailable data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTablets must be taken orally twice daily, i.e. once in the morning and once in the evening during meals (see \nsection 5.2).  \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- Resting heart rate below 70 beats per minute prior to treatment \n- Cardiogenic shock \n- Acute myocardial infarction \n- Severe hypotension (<90/50 mmHg) \n- Severe hepatic insufficiency \n- Sick sinus syndrome \n- Sino-atrial block \n- Unstable or acute heart failure \n- Pacemaker dependent (heart rate imposed exclusively by the pacemaker) \n- Unstable angina \n- AV-block of 3rd degree \n- Combination with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, \n\nitraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), \nHIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2) \n\n- Combination with verapamil or diltiazem which are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with heart rate \nreducing properties (see section 4.5) \n\n- Pregnancy, lactation and women of child-bearing potential not using appropriate contraceptive \nmeasures (see section 4.6) \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSpecial warnings  \n \nLack of benefit on clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina pectoris \nIvabradine is indicated only for symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris because ivabradine \nhas no benefits on cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nMeasurement of heart rate \nGiven that the heart rate may fluctuate considerably over time, serial heart rate measurements, ECG or \nambulatory 24-hour monitoring should be considered when determining resting heart rate before initiation of \nivabradine treatment and in patients on treatment with ivabradine when titration is considered. This also \napplies to patients with a low heart rate, in particular when heart rate decreases below 50 bpm, or after dose \nreduction (see section 4.2). \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nCardiac arrhythmias \nIvabradine is not effective in the treatment or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and likely loses its efficacy \nwhen a tachyarrhythmia occurs (e.g. ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia). Ivabradine is therefore not \nrecommended in patients with atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias that interfere with sinus node \nfunction. \nIn patients treated with ivabradine the risk of developing atrial fibrillation is increased (see section 4.8). \nAtrial fibrillation has been more common in patients using concomitantly amiodarone or potent class I \nanti-arrhythmics. It is recommended to regularly clinically monitor ivabradine treated patients for the \noccurrence of atrial fibrillation (sustained or paroxysmal), which should also include ECG monitoring if \nclinically indicated (e.g. in case of exacerbated angina, palpitations, irregular pulse). \nPatients should be informed of signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation and be advised to contact their \nphysician if these occur. \nIf atrial fibrillation develops during treatment, the balance of benefits and risks of continued ivabradine \ntreatment should be carefully reconsidered. \n \nChronic heart failure patients with intraventricular conduction defects (bundle branch block left, bundle \nbranch block right) and ventricular dyssynchrony should be monitored closely. \n \nUse in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree \nIvabradine is not recommended in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree. \n \nUse in patients with a low heart rate \nIvabradine must not be initiated in patients with a pre-treatment resting heart rate below 70 beats per minute \n(see section 4.3). \nIf, during treatment, resting heart rate decreases persistently below 50 bpm or the patient experiences \nsymptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated \ndownward or treatment discontinued if heart rate below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nCombination with calcium channel blockers \nConcomitant use of ivabradine with heart rate reducing calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or \ndiltiazem is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). No safety issue has been raised on the combination of \nivabradine with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine. Additional \nefficacy of ivabradine in combination with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has not been \nestablished (see section 5.1). \n \nChronic heart failure \nHeart failure must be stable before considering ivabradine treatment. Ivabradine should be used with caution \nin heart failure patients with NYHA functional classification IV due to limited amount of data in this \npopulation. \n \nStroke \nThe use of ivabradine is not recommended immediately after a stroke since no data is available in these \nsituations. \n \nVisual function \nIvabradine influences on retinal function (see section 5.1). To date, there is no evidence of a toxic effect of \nivabradine on the retina, but the effects of long-term ivabradine treatment beyond one year on retinal \nfunction are currently not known. Cessation of treatment should be considered if any unexpected \ndeterioration in visual function occurs. Caution should be exercised in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nPrecautions for use \n \nPatients with hypotension \nLimited data are available in patients with mild to moderate hypotension, and ivabradine should therefore be \nused with caution in these patients. Ivabradine is contraindicated in patients with severe hypotension (blood \npressure < 90/50 mmHg) (see section 4.3). \n \nAtrial fibrillation - Cardiac arrhythmias \nThere is no evidence of risk of (excessive) bradycardia on return to sinus rhythm when pharmacological \ncardioversion is initiated in patients treated with ivabradine. However, in the absence of extensive data, non \nurgent DC-cardioversion should be considered 24 hours after the last dose of ivabradine. \n \nUse in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products \nThe use of ivabradine in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal \nproducts should be avoided (see section 4.5). If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring \nis needed. \nHeart rate reduction, as caused by ivabradine, may exacerbate QT prolongation, which may give rise to \nsevere arrhythmias, in particular Torsade de pointes. \n \nHypertensive patients requiring blood pressure treatment modifications. \nIn the SHIFT trial more patients experienced episodes of increased blood pressure while treated with \nivabradine (7.1%) compared to patients treated with placebo (6.1%). These episodes occurred most \nfrequently shortly after blood pressure treatment was modified, were transient, and did not affect the \ntreatment effect of ivabradine. When treatment modifications are made in chronic heart failure patients \ntreated with ivabradine blood pressure should be monitored at an appropriate interval (see section 4.8). \n \nExcipients \nSince tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n  \nConcomitant use not recommended \nQT prolonging medicinal products \n- Cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, bepridil, sotalol, \n\nibutilide, amiodarone). \n- Non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole, \n\nmefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine, cisapride, intravenous erythromycin). \n \nThe concomitant use of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products with \nivabradine should be avoided since QT prolongation may be exacerbated by heart rate reduction. If the \ncombination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed (see section 4.4). \n \nConcomitant use with precaution \nPotassium-depleting diuretics (thiazide diuretics and loop diuretics): hypokalaemia can increase the risk of \narrhythmia. As ivabradine may cause bradycardia, the resulting combination of hypokalaemia and \nbradycardia is a predisposing factor to the onset of severe arrhythmias, especially in patients with long QT \nsyndrome, whether congenital or substance-induced. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nCytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) \nIvabradine is metabolised by CYP3A4 only and it is a very weak inhibitor of this cytochrome. Ivabradine \nwas shown not to influence the metabolism and plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates (mild, \nmoderate and strong inhibitors). CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are liable to interact with ivabradine and \ninfluence its metabolism and pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. Drug-drug interaction \nstudies have established that CYP3A4 inhibitors increase ivabradine plasma concentrations, while inducers \ndecrease them. Increased plasma concentrations of ivabradine may be associated with the risk of excessive \nbradycardia (see section 4.4). \n \nContraindication of concomitant use \nThe concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), \nmacrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease \ninhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone is contraindicated (see section 4.3). The potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitors ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) and josamycin (1 g twice daily) increased ivabradine mean \nplasma exposure by 7 to 8 fold. \n \nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors: specific interaction studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown that \nthe combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents diltiazem or verapamil resulted in an \nincrease in ivabradine exposure (2 to 3 fold increase in AUC) and an additional heart rate reduction of \n5 bpm. The concomitant use of ivabradine with these medicinal products is contraindicated (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \nGrapefruit juice: ivabradine exposure was increased by 2-fold following the co-administration with \ngrapefruit juice. Therefore the intake of grapefruit juice should be avoided. \n \nConcomitant use with precautions \n- Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: the concomitant use of ivabradine with other moderate CYP3A4 \n\ninhibitors (e.g. fluconazole) may be considered at the starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and if resting \nheart rate is above 70 bpm, with monitoring of heart rate. \n\n- CYP3A4 inducers: CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, Hypericum perforatum \n[St John’s wort]) may decrease ivabradine exposure and activity. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 \ninducing medicinal products may require an adjustment of the dose of ivabradine. The combination of \nivabradine 10 mg twice daily with St John’s wort was shown to reduce ivabradine AUC by half. The \nintake of St John’s wort should be restricted during the treatment with ivabradine. \n\n \nOther concomitant use \nSpecific drug-drug interaction studies have shown no clinically significant effect of the following medicinal \nproducts on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivabradine: proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, \nlansoprazole), sildenafil, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin), dihydropyridine calcium channel \nblockers (amlodipine, lacidipine), digoxin and warfarin. In addition there was no clinically significant effect \nof ivabradine on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, amlodipine, lacidipine, on the pharmacokinetics and \npharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin and on the pharmacodynamics of aspirin. \nIn pivotal phase III clinical trials the following medicinal products were routinely combined with ivabradine \nwith no evidence of safety concerns: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, \nbeta-blockers, diuretics, anti-aldosterone agents, short and long acting nitrates, HMG CoA reductase \ninhibitors, fibrates, proton pump inhibitors, oral antidiabetics, aspirin and other anti-platelet medicinal \nproducts. \n \nPaediatric population \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential \nWomen of child-bearing potential should use appropriate contraceptive measures during treatment (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of ivabradine in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. These studies have shown embryotoxic and teratogenic \neffects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Therefore, ivabradine is contraindicated \nduring pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \nAnimal studies indicate that ivabradine is excreted in milk. Therefore, ivabradine is contraindicated during \nbreast-feeding (see section 4.3). \nWomen that need treatment with ivabradine should stop breast-feeding, and choose for another way of \nfeeding their child. \n \nFertility \nStudies in rats have shown no effect on fertility in males and females (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nA specific study to assess the possible influence of ivabradine on driving performance has been performed in \nhealthy volunteers where no alteration of the driving performance was evidenced. However, in \npost-marketing experience, cases of impaired driving ability due to visual symptoms have been reported. \nIvabradine may cause transient luminous phenomena consisting mainly of phosphenes (see section 4.8). The \npossible occurrence of such luminous phenomena should be taken into account when driving or using \nmachines in situations where sudden variations in light intensity may occur, especially when driving at night. \nIvabradine has no influence on the ability to use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nIvabradine has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 45,000 participants. \nThe most common adverse reactions with ivabradine, luminous phenomena (phosphenes) and bradycardia, \nare dose dependent and related to the pharmacological effect of the medicinal product. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical trials and are ranked using the following \nfrequency: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Preferred Term \nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Eosinophilia \n\nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Hyperuricaemia \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache, generally during the \nfirst month of treatment \nDizziness, possibly related to \nbradycardia \n\nUncommon* Syncope, possibly related to \nbradycardia \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nEye disorders Very common Luminous phenomena \n(phosphenes) \n\nCommon Blurred vision \nUncommon* Diplopia \n\nVisual impairment \nEar and labyrinth disorders Uncommon Vertigo \nCardiac disorders Common Bradycardia \n\nAV 1st degree block (ECG \nprolonged PQ interval) \nVentricular extrasystoles \nAtrial fibrillation \n\nUncommon Palpitations, supraventricular \nextrasystoles \n\nVery rare AV 2nd degree block, AV 3rd \ndegree block \nSick sinus syndrome \n\nVascular disorders Common Uncontrolled blood pressure \nUncommon* Hypotension, possibly related \n\nto bradycardia \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nUncommon Dyspnoea \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Uncommon Nausea \nConstipation \nDiarrhoea \nAbdominal pain* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon* Angioedema \nRash \n\nRare* Erythema \nPruritus \nUrticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nUncommon Muscle cramps \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nUncommon* Asthenia, possibly related to \nbradycardia \nFatigue, possibly related to \nbradycardia \n\nRare* Malaise, possibly related to \nbradycardia \n\nInvestigations Uncommon Elevated creatinine in blood \nECG prolonged QT interval \n\n* Frequency calculated from clinical trials for adverse events detected from spontaneous report \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nLuminous phenomena (phosphenes) were reported by 14.5% of patients, described as a transient enhanced \nbrightness in a limited area of the visual field. They are usually triggered by sudden variations in light \nintensity. Phosphenes may also be described as a halo, image decomposition (stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic \neffects), coloured bright lights, or multiple image (retinal persistency). The onset of phosphenes is generally \nwithin the first two months of treatment after which they may occur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally \nreported to be of mild to moderate intensity. All phosphenes resolved during or after treatment, of which a \nmajority (77.5%) resolved during treatment. Fewer than 1% of patients changed their daily routine or \ndiscontinued the treatment in relation with phosphenes. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nBradycardia was reported by 3.3% of patients particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of treatment \ninitiation. 0.5% of patients experienced a severe bradycardia below or equal to 40 bpm. \n \nIn the SIGNIFY study atrial fibrillation was observed in 5.3% of patients taking ivabradine compared to \n3.8% in the placebo group. In a pooled analysis of all the Phase II/III double blind controlled clinical trials \nwith a duration of at least 3 months including more than 40,000 patients, the incidence of atrial fibrillation \nwas 4.86% in ivabradine treated patients compared to 4.08% in controls, corresponding to a hazard ratio of \n1.26, 95% CI [1.15-1.39]. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms  \nOverdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia (see section 4.8). \n \nManagement \nSevere bradycardia should be treated symptomatically in a specialised environment. In the event of \nbradycardia with poor haemodynamic tolerance, symptomatic treatment including intravenous \nbeta-stimulating medicinal products such as isoprenaline may be considered. Temporary cardiac electrical \npacing may be instituted if required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Cardiac therapy, other cardiac preparations, ATC code: C01EB17. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nIvabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent, acting by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac \npacemaker If current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in the sinus node and regulates \nheart rate. The cardiac effects are specific to the sinus node with no effect on intra-atrial, atrioventricular or \nintraventricular conduction times, nor on myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarisation. \n \nIvabradine can interact also with the retinal current Ih which closely resembles cardiac If. It participates in \nthe temporal resolution of the visual system, by curtailing the retinal response to bright light stimuli. Under \ntriggering circumstances (e.g. rapid changes in luminosity), partial inhibition of Ih by ivabradine underlies \nthe luminous phenomena that may be occasionally experienced by patients. Luminous phenomena \n(phosphenes) are described as a transient enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThe main pharmacodynamic property of ivabradine in humans is a specific dose dependent reduction in heart \nrate. Analysis of heart rate reduction with doses up to 20 mg twice daily indicates a trend towards a plateau \neffect which is consistent with a reduced risk of severe bradycardia below 40 bpm (see section 4.8). \nAt usual recommended doses, heart rate reduction is approximately 10 bpm at rest and during exercise. This \nleads to a reduction in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption. Ivabradine does not influence \nintracardiac conduction, contractility (no negative inotropic effect) or ventricular repolarisation:  \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n- in clinical electrophysiology studies, ivabradine had no effect on atrioventricular or intraventricular \nconduction times or corrected QT intervals; \n\n- in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 30 and \n45%), ivabradine did not have any deleterious influence on LVEF. \n\n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was studied in five double-blind randomised trials \n(three versus placebo, and one each versus atenolol and amlodipine). These trials included a total of \n4,111 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, of whom 2,617 received ivabradine. \n \nIvabradine 5 mg twice daily was shown to be effective on exercise test parameters within 3 to 4 weeks of \ntreatment. Efficacy was confirmed with 7.5 mg twice daily. In particular, the additional benefit over 5 mg \ntwice daily was established in a reference-controlled study versus atenolol: total exercise duration at trough \nwas increased by about 1 minute after one month of treatment with 5 mg twice daily and further improved by \nalmost 25 seconds after an additional 3-month period with forced titration to 7.5 mg twice daily. In this \nstudy, the antianginal and anti-ischaemic benefits of ivabradine were confirmed in patients aged 65 years or \nmore. The efficacy of 5 and 7.5 mg twice daily was consistent across studies on exercise test parameters \n(total exercise duration, time to limiting angina, time to angina onset and time to 1 mm ST segment \ndepression) and was associated with a decrease of about 70% in the rate of angina attacks. The twice-daily \ndosing regimen of ivabradine gave uniform efficacy over 24 hours. \n \nIn a 889-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine given on top of atenolol 50 mg o.d. \nshowed additional efficacy on all ETT parameters at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral intake). \nIn a 725-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on top of \namlodipine 10 mg o.d. at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral intake) while an additional efficacy \nwas shown at peak (3-4 hours after oral intake). \n \nIn a 1,277-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine demonstrated a statistically significant \nadditional efficacy on response to treatment (defined as a decrease of at least 3 angina attacks per week \nand/or an increase in the time to 1 mm ST segment depression of at least 60 s during a treadmill ETT) on top \nof amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or nifedipine GITS 30 mg o.d. at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral \nivabradine intake) over a 6-week treatment period (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.0–1.7]; p = 0.012). Ivabradine did \nnot show additional efficacy on secondary endpoints of ETT parameters at the trough of drug activity while \nan additional efficacy was shown at peak (3-4 hours after oral ivabradine intake). \n \nIvabradine efficacy was fully maintained throughout the 3- or 4-month treatment periods in the efficacy \ntrials. There was no evidence of pharmacological tolerance (loss of efficacy) developing during treatment nor \nof rebound phenomena after abrupt treatment discontinuation. The antianginal and anti-ischaemic effects of \nivabradine were associated with dose-dependent reductions in heart rate and with a significant decrease in \nrate pressure product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure) at rest and during exercise. The effects on blood \npressure and peripheral vascular resistance were minor and not clinically significant. \n \nA sustained reduction of heart rate was demonstrated in patients treated with ivabradine for at least one year \n(n = 713). No influence on glucose or lipid metabolism was observed. \n \nThe antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was preserved in diabetic patients (n = 457) with a \nsimilar safety profile as compared to the overall population. \n \nA large outcome study, BEAUTIFUL, was performed in 10,917 patients with coronary artery disease and \nleft ventricular dysfunction (LVEF <40%) on top of optimal background therapy with 86.9% of patients \nreceiving beta-blockers. The main efficacy criterion was the composite of cardiovascular death, \nhospitalisation for acute MI or hospitalisation for new onset or worsening heart failure. The study showed no \ndifference in the rate of the primary composite outcome in the ivabradine group by comparison to the \nplacebo group (relative risk ivabradine: placebo 1.00, p = 0.945). \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nIn a post-hoc subgroup of patients with symptomatic angina at randomisation (n = 1,507), no safety signal \nwas identified regarding cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for acute MI or heart failure (ivabradine 12.0% \nversus placebo 15.5%, p = 0.05). \n \nA large outcome study, SIGNIFY, was performed in 19,102 patients with coronary artery disease and \nwithout clinical heart failure (LVEF >40%), on top of optimal background therapy. A therapeutic scheme \nhigher than the approved posology was used (starting dose 7.5 mg b.i.d. (5 mg b.i.d, if age ≥75 years) and \ntitration up to 10 mg b.i.d). The main efficacy criterion was the composite of cardiovascular death or \nnon-fatal MI. The study showed no difference in the rate of the primary composite endpoint (PCE) in the \nivabradine group by comparison to the placebo group (relative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.08, p = 0.197). \nBradycardia was reported by 17.9% of patients in the ivabradine group (2.1% in the placebo group). \nVerapamil, diltiazem or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors were received by 7.1% of patients during the study. \nA small statistically significant increase in the PCE was observed in a pre-specified subgroup of patients \nwith angina patients in CCS class II or higher at baseline (n = 12,049) (annual rates 3.4% versus 2.9%, \nrelative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.18, p = 0.018), but not in the subgroup of the overall angina population in \nCCS class ≥ I (n=14,286) (relative risk ivabradine/placebo 1.11, p = 0.110). \nThe higher than approved dose used in the study did not fully explain these findings. \nThe SHIFT study was a large multicentre, international, randomised double-blind placebo controlled outcome \ntrial conducted in 6,505 adult patients with stable chronic CHF (for ≥4 weeks), NYHA class II to IV, with a \nreduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤35%) and a resting heart rate ≥70 bpm. \n \nPatients received standard care including beta-blockers (89%), ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II \nantagonists (91%), diuretics (83%), and anti-aldosterone agents (60%). In the ivabradine group, 67% of \npatients were treated with 7.5 mg twice a day. The median follow-up duration was 22.9 months. Treatment \nwith ivabradine was associated with an average reduction in heart rate of 15 bpm from a baseline value of \n80 bpm. The difference in heart rate between ivabradine and placebo arms was 10.8 bpm at 28 days, 9.1 bpm \nat 12 months and 8.3 bpm at 24 months. \n \nThe study demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant relative risk reduction of 18% in the rate of \nthe primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation for worsening heart failure \n(hazard ratio: 0.82, 95% CI [0.75;0.90] – p <0.0001) apparent within 3 months of initiation of treatment. The \nabsolute risk reduction was 4.2%. The results on the primary endpoint are mainly driven by the heart failure \nendpoints, hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (absolute risk reduced by 4.7%) and deaths from heart \nfailure (absolute risk reduced by 1.1%). \n \nTreatment effect on the primary composite endpoint, its components and secondary endpoints \n \n Ivabradine \n\n(N=3,241) \nn (%) \n\nPlacebo \n(N=3,264) \n\nn (%) \n\nHazard ratio \n[95% CI] \n\np-value \n\nPrimary composite \nendpoint \n\n793 (24.47) 937 (28.71) 0.82 [0.75; 0.90] <0.0001 \n\nComponents of the \ncomposite: \n-CV death \n-Hospitalisation for \nworsening HF \n\n \n \n\n449 (13.85) \n514 (15.86) \n\n \n \n\n491 (15.04) \n672 (20.59) \n\n \n \n\n0.91 [0.80; 1.03] \n0.74 [0.66; 0.83] \n\n \n \n\n0.128 \n<0.0001 \n\nOther secondary \nendpoints: \n-All cause death \n-Death from HF \n-Hospitalisation for \nany cause \n-Hospitalisation for \nCV reason \n\n \n \n\n503 (15.52) \n113 (3.49) \n\n1231 (37.98) \n \n\n977 (30.15) \n\n \n \n\n552 (16.91) \n151 (4.63) \n\n1356 (41.54) \n \n\n1122 (34.38) \n\n \n \n\n0.90 [0.80; 1.02] \n0.74 [0.58; 0.94] \n0.89 [0.82; 0.96] \n\n \n0.85 [0.78; 0.92] \n\n \n \n\n0.092 \n0.014 \n0.003 \n\n \n0.0002 \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \nThe reduction in the primary endpoint was observed consistently irrespective of gender, NYHA class, \nischaemic or non-ischaemic heart failure aetiology and of background history of diabetes or hypertension. \n \nIn the subgroup of patients with HR ≥75 bpm (n = 4,150), a greater reduction was observed in the primary \ncomposite endpoint of 24% (hazard ratio: 0.76, 95% CI [0.68;0.85] – p <0.0001) and for other secondary \nendpoints, including all cause death (hazard ratio: 0.83, 95% CI [0.72;0.96] – p = 0.0109) and CV death \n(hazard ratio: 0.83, 95% CI [0.71;0.97] – p = 0.0166).

The dose was adapted depending on the \ntherapeutic response with maximum doses of 0.2 mg/kg bid, 0.3 mg/kg bid and 15 mg bid respectively. In \nthis study, ivabradine was administered as oral liquid formulation or tablet twice daily. The absence of \npharmacokinetic difference between the 2 formulations was shown in an open-label randomised two-period \ncross-over study in 24 adult healthy volunteers. \nA 20% heart rate reduction, without bradycardia, was achieved by 69.9% of patients in the ivabradine group \nversus 12.2% in the placebo group during the titration period of 2 to 8 weeks (Odds Ratio: E = 17.24, \n95% CI [5.91; 50.30]). \nThe mean ivabradine doses allowing to achieve a 20% HRR were 0.13 ± 0.04 mg/kg bid, 0.10 ± 0.04 mg/kg \nbid and 4.1 ± 2.2 mg bid in the age subsets [1-3]years, [3-18]years and <40 kg and [3-18] years and ≥40 kg, \nrespectively. \nMean LVEF increased from 31.8% to 45.3% at M012 in ivabradine group versus 35.4% to 42.3% in the \nplacebo group. There was an improvement in NYHA class in 37.7% of ivabradine patients versus 25.0% in \nthe placebo group. These improvements were not statistically significant. \nThe safety profile, over one year, was similar to the one described in adult CHF patients. \n \nThe long-term effects of ivabradine on growth, puberty and general development as well as the long-term \nefficacy of therapy with ivabradine in childhood to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not \nbeen studied. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing ivabradine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment \nof angina pectoris (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ivabradine \nin children aged 0 to less than 6 months in the treatment of chronic heart failure. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nUnder physiological conditions, ivabradine is rapidly released from tablets and is highly water-soluble \n(>10 mg/ml). Ivabradine is the S-enantiomer with no bioconversion demonstrated in vivo. The \nN-desmethylated derivative of ivabradine has been identified as the main active metabolite in humans. \n \nAbsorption and bioavailability \nIvabradine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma level \nreached in about 1 hour under fasting condition. The absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablets is \naround 40%, due to first-pass effect in the gut and liver. \nFood delayed absorption by approximately 1 hour, and increased plasma exposure by 20 to 30%. The intake \nof the tablet during meals is recommended in order to decrease intra-individual variability in exposure (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nDistribution \nIvabradine is approximately 70% plasma protein bound and the volume of distribution at steady-state is close \nto 100 l in patients. The maximum plasma concentration following chronic administration at the \nrecommended dose of 5 mg twice daily is 22 ng/ml (CV=29%). The average plasma concentration is \n10 ng/ml (CV=38%) at steady-state. \n \nBiotransformation \nIvabradine is extensively metabolised by the liver and the gut by oxidation through cytochrome P450 3A4 \n(CYP3A4) only. The major active metabolite is the N-desmethylated derivative (S 18982) with an exposure \nabout 40% of that of the parent compound. The metabolism of this active metabolite also involves CYP3A4. \nIvabradine has low affinity for CYP3A4, shows no clinically relevant CYP3A4 induction or inhibition and is \ntherefore unlikely to modify CYP3A4 substrate metabolism or plasma concentrations. Inversely, potent \ninhibitors and inducers may substantially affect ivabradine plasma concentrations (see section 4.5). \n \nElimination \nIvabradine is eliminated with a main half-life of 2 hours (70-75% of the AUC) in plasma and an effective \nhalf-life of 11 hours. The total clearance is about 400 ml/min and the renal clearance is about 70 ml/min. \nExcretion of metabolites occurs to a similar extent via faeces and urine. About 4% of an oral dose is excreted \nunchanged in urine. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \nThe kinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5-24 mg. \n \nSpecial populations \n- Elderly: no pharmacokinetic differences (AUC and Cmax) have been observed between elderly \n\n(≥65 years) or very elderly patients (≥75 years) and the overall population (see section 4.2). \n- Renal impairment: the impact of renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 15 to 60 ml/min) on \n\nivabradine pharmacokinetic is minimal, in relation with the low contribution of renal clearance (about \n20%) to total elimination for both ivabradine and its main metabolite S 18982 (see section 4.2). \n\n- Hepatic impairment: in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score up to 7) unbound \nAUC of ivabradine and the main active metabolite were about 20% higher than in subjects with \nnormal hepatic function. Data are insufficient to draw conclusions in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and \n4.3). \n\n- Paediatric population: The pharmacokinetic profile of ivabradine in paediatric chronic heart failure \npatients aged 6 months to less than 18 years is similar to the pharmacokinetics described in adults \nwhen a titration scheme based on age and weight is applied. \n\n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship \nPK/PD relationship analysis has shown that heart rate decreases almost linearly with increasing ivabradine \nand S 18982 plasma concentrations for doses of up to 15-20 mg twice daily. At higher doses, the decrease in \nheart rate is no longer proportional to ivabradine plasma concentrations and tends to reach a plateau. High \nexposures to ivabradine that may occur when ivabradine is given in combination with strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitors may result in an excessive decrease in heart rate although this risk is reduced with moderate \nCYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). The PK/PD relationship of ivabradine in paediatric \nchronic heart failure patients aged 6 months to less than 18 years is similar to the PK/PD relationship \ndescribed in adults. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, \nrepeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential. Reproductive toxicity studies showed no effect \nof ivabradine on fertility in male and female rats. When pregnant animals were treated during organogenesis \nat exposures close to therapeutic doses, there was a higher incidence of foetuses with cardiac defects in the \nrat and a small number of foetuses with ectrodactylia in the rabbit. \nIn dogs given ivabradine (doses of 2, 7 or 24 mg/kg/day) for one year, reversible changes in retinal function \nwere observed but were not associated with any damage to ocular structures. These data are consistent with \nthe pharmacological effect of ivabradine related to its interaction with hyperpolarisation-activated Ih currents \nin the retina, which share extensive homology with the cardiac pacemaker If current. \nOther long-term repeat dose and carcinogenicity studies revealed no clinically relevant changes. \n \nEnvironmental Risk Assessment (ERA) \nThe environmental risk assessment of ivabradine has been conducted in accordance to European guidelines \non ERA. \nOutcomes of these evaluations support the lack of environmental risk of ivabradine and ivabradine does not \npose a threat to the environment. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ivabradine JensonR is and what it is used for \n \nIvabradine JensonR (ivabradine) is a heart medicine used to treat: \n- Symptomatic stable angina pectoris (which causes chest pain) in adult patients whose heart rate is over \n\nor equal to 70 beats per minute. It is used in adult patients who do not tolerate or cannot take heart \nmedicines called beta-blockers. It is also used in combination with beta-blockers in adult patients \nwhose condition is not fully controlled with a beta-blocker. \n\n- Chronic heart failure in adult patients whose heart rate is over or equal to 75 beats per minute. It is \nused in combination with standard therapy, including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blockers are \ncontraindicated or not tolerated. \n\n \nAbout stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as “angina”): \nStable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen. It usually \nappears between 40 and 50 years of age. The most common symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort. \nAngina is more likely to happen when the heart beats faster in situations such as exercise, emotion, exposure \nto the cold or after eating. This increase in heart rate can cause the chest pain in people who suffer from \nangina. \n \nAbout chronic heart failure: \nChronic heart failure is a heart disease which happens when your heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest \nof your body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, tiredness and ankle \nswelling. \n \nHow does Ivabradine JensonR work \nIvabradine JensonR mainly works by reducing the heart rate by a few beats per minute.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ivabradine JensonR is and what it is used for \n \nIvabradine JensonR (ivabradine) is a heart medicine used to treat: \n- Symptomatic stable angina pectoris (which causes chest pain) in adult patients whose heart rate is over \n\nor equal to 70 beats per minute. It is used in adult patients who do not tolerate or cannot take heart \nmedicines called beta-blockers. It is also used in combination with beta-blockers in adult patients \nwhose condition is not fully controlled with a beta-blocker. \n\n- Chronic heart failure in adult patients whose heart rate is over or equal to 75 beats per minute. It is \nused in combination with standard therapy, including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blockers are \ncontraindicated or not tolerated. \n\n \nAbout stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as “angina”): \nStable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen. It usually \nappears between 40 and 50 years of age. The most common symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort. \nAngina is more likely to happen when the heart beats faster in situations such as exercise, emotion, exposure \nto the cold or after eating. This increase in heart rate can cause the chest pain in people who suffer from \nangina. \n \nAbout chronic heart failure: \nChronic heart failure is a heart disease which happens when your heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest \nof your body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, tiredness and ankle \nswelling. \n \nHow does Ivabradine JensonR work \nIvabradine JensonR mainly works by reducing the heart rate by a few beats per minute. This lowers the \nheart’s need for oxygen especially in the situations when an angina attack is more likely to happen. In this \nway Ivabradine JensonR helps to control and reduce the number of angina attacks. \n \n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nFurthermore as elevated heart rate adversely affects the heart functioning and vital prognosis in patients with \nchronic heart failure, the specific heart rate lowering action of ivabradine helps to improve the heart \nfunctioning and vital prognosis in these patients. \n \n \n2.
