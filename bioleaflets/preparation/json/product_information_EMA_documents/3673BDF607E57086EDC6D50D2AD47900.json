This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVeklury 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg of remdesivir. \nEach mL of concentrate contains 5 mg of remdesivir. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach vial contains 6 g betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \nClear, colorless to yellow, aqueous-based concentrated solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVeklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and \nadolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring \nsupplemental oxygen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nUse of remdesivir is confined to healthcare facilities in which patients can be monitored closely (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dosage of remdesivir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least \n40 kg is: \n• Day 1 – single loading dose of remdesivir 200 mg given by intravenous infusion \n• Day 2 onwards – 100 mg given once daily by intravenous infusion. \n \nThe total duration of treatment should be at least 5 days and not more than 10 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of remdesivir is required in patients over the age of 65 years (see sections 5.1 and \n5.2). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment. \nPatients with eGFR ≥30 mL/min have received remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 with no dose \nadjustment. Remdesivir should not be used in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. It is \nnot known if dosage adjustment is appropriate in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of remdesivir in children under the age of 12 years and weighing <40 kg have \nnot yet been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intravenous use. \n \nRemdesivir is for administration by intravenous infusion after further dilution. \n \nIt must not be given as an intramuscular (IM) injection. \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \nTable 1: Recommended rate of infusion – for diluted remdesivir concentrate for solution for \n\ninfusion \n\nInfusion Bag Volume Infusion Time Rate of Infusion \n\n250 mL \n30 min 8.33 mL/min \n60 min 4.17 mL/min \n\n120 min 2.08 mL/min \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions have been observed \nduring and following administration of remdesivir. Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, \nhypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, \nvomiting, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates, with a maximum infusion time of up to \n120 minutes, can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms. If signs and \nsymptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur, immediately discontinue \nadministration of remdesivir and initiate appropriate treatment. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTransaminase elevations \n \nTransaminase elevations have been observed in the remdesivir clinical trials, including in healthy \nvolunteers and patients with COVID-19. Liver function should be determined in all patients prior to \nstarting remdesivir and should be monitored while receiving it as clinically appropriate. No clinical \nstudies with remdesivir have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Remdesivir should \nonly be used in patients with hepatic impairment if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n• Remdesivir should not be initiated in patients with Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥5 times \n\nthe upper limit of normal at baseline \n• Remdesivir should be discontinued in patients who develop: \n\n◦ ALT ≥5 times the upper limit of normal during treatment with remdesivir. It may be \nrestarted when ALT is <5 times the upper limit of normal. \nOR \n\n◦ ALT elevation accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing \nconjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international normalised ratio (INR) (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn animal studies on rats and monkeys, severe renal toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). The \nmechanism of this renal toxicity is not fully understood. A relevance for humans cannot be excluded. \n \nAll patients should have eGFR determined prior to starting remdesivir and while receiving it as \nclinically appropriate. Remdesivir should not be used in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min. \n \nExcipients \n \nRemdesivir contains betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, which is renally cleared and accumulates in \npatients with decreased renal function, which may potentially adversely affect renal function. \nTherefore remdesivir should not be used in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRisk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine  \n \nCoadministration of remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not \nrecommended based on in vitro data demonstrating an antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the \nintracellular metabolic activation and antiviral activity of remdesivir (see section 4.5, 5.1) \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinical interaction studies have been performed with remdesivir. The overall potential for \ninteractions is currently unknown; patients should remain under close observation during the days of \nremdesivir administration. Due to antagonism observed in vitro, concomitant use of remdesivir with \nchloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not recommended. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on remdesivir \n \nIn vitro, remdesivir is a substrate for esterases in plasma and tissue, drug metabolizing enzymes \nCYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and is a substrate for Organic Anion Transporting \nPolypeptides 1B1 (OATP1B1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. \n \nThe potential of interaction of remdesivir with inhibitors/inducers of the hydrolytic pathway (esterase) \nor CYP2C8, 2D6 or 3A4 has not been studied. The risk of clinically relevant interaction is unknown. \nStrong inhibitors may result in increased remdesivir exposure. The use of strong inducers (e.g. \nrifampicin) may decrease plasma concentrations of remdesivir and is not recommended. \n \nDexamethasone is reported to be a moderate inducer of CYP3A and P-gp. Induction is dose-dependent \nand occurs after multiple doses. Dexamethasone is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on \n\n\n\n5 \n\nremdesivir as remdesivir has a moderate-high hepatic extraction ratio, and is used for a short duration \nin the treatment of COVID-19.  \n \nEffects of remdesivir on other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro, remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The clinical relevance of \nthese in vitro drug interactions has not been established. Remdesivir may transiently increase plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A or OATP 1B1/1B3. No data is \navailable, however it can be suggested that medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 or \nsubstrates of OATP 1B1/1B3 should be administered at least 2 hours after remdesivir. Remdesivir \ninduced CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of remdesivir with CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index may lead to loss of their efficacy. \n \nDexamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although remdesivir inhibits CYP3A4, due to \nremdesivir's rapid clearance after I.V administration, remdesivir is unlikely to have a significant effect \non dexamethasone exposure. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of remdesivir in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Remdesivir should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the women requires treatment with it. \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether remdesivir is excreted in human milk or the effects on the breast-fed infant, or \nthe effects on milk production. \n \nIn animal studies, the nucleoside analog metabolite GS-441524 has been detected in the blood of \nnursing rat pups of mothers given remedesivir. Therefore, excretion of remdesivir and/or metabolites \ninto the milk of lactating animals can be assumed. \n \nBecause of the potential for viral transmission to SARS-CoV-2-negative infants and adverse reactions \nfrom the drug in breast-feeding infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from Remdesivir therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of remdesivir on fertility are available. In male rats, there was no effect \non mating or fertility with remdesivir treatment. In female rats, however, an impairment of fertility \nwas observed (see section 5.3). The relevance for humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRemdesivir is predicted to have no or negligible influence on these abilities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction in healthy volunteers is increased transaminases (14%). The most \ncommon adverse reaction in patients with COVID-19 is nausea (4%). \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies \nare defined as follows: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \nFrequency Adverse reaction \n\nImmune system disorders \nRare hypersensitivity \nNervous system disorders \nCommon headache \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon nausea \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common transaminases increased \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon rash \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nRare infusion-related reaction \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTransaminases Increased \nIn healthy volunteer studies, increases in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or both in subjects \nwho received remdesivir were grade 1 (10%) or grade 2 (4%). In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled clinical study of patients with COVID-19 (NIAID ACTT-1), the incidence of grade ≥3 non-\nserious adverse events of increased aminotransferase levels including ALT, AST, or both was 4% in \npatients receiving remdesivir compared with 6% in receiving placebo. In a randomised, open-label \nmulti-centre clinical trial (Study GS-US-540-5773) in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 \nreceiving remdesivir for 5 (n=200) or 10 days (n=197), any grade (≥1.25 × upper limit of normal \n(ULN)) laboratory abnormalities of increased AST and increased ALT occurred in 40% and 42% of \npatients, respectively, receiving remdesivir. Grade ≥3 (≥5.0 × ULN) laboratory abnormalities of \nincreased AST and increased ALT both occurred in 7% of patients receiving remdesivir. In a \nrandomised, open-label multi-centre clinical trial (Study GS-US-540-5774) in hospitalised patients \nwith moderate COVID-19 receiving remdesivir for 5 (n=191) or 10 days (n=193) compared to \nstandard of care (n=200), any grade laboratory abnormalities of increased AST and increased ALT \noccurred in 32% and 33% of patients, respectively, receiving remdesivir, and 33% and 39% of patients, \nrespectively, receiving standard of care. Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities of increased AST and \nincreased ALT occurred in 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, receiving remdesivir and 6% and 7%, \nrespectively, receiving standard of care. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nTreatment of overdose with remdesivir should consist of general supportive measures including \nmonitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific \nantidote for overdose with remdesivir. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, other antivirals, ATC \ncode: not yet assigned \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRemdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that is metabolized within host cells to form the \npharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite. Remdesivir triphosphate acts as an \nanalog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate for incorporation \ninto nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in \ndelayed chain termination during replication of the viral RNA. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nRemdesivir exhibited in vitro activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in primary human \nairway epithelial cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 9.9 nM after 48 hours of treatment. \nThe EC50 values of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells were 137 nM at 24 hours and \n750 nM at 48 hours post-treatment. The antiviral activity of remdesivir was antagonised by \nchloroquine phosphate in a dose-dependent manner when the two drugs were co-incubated at clinically \nrelevant concentrations in HEp-2 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Higher \nremdesivir EC50 values were observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate. \nIncreasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate reduced formation of remdesivir triphosphate in \nnormal human bronchial epithelial cells. \n \nResistance \n \nCell culture resistance profiling of remdesivir using the rodent CoV murine hepatitis virus identified \n2 substitutions (F476L and V553L) in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase at residues \nconserved across CoVs that conferred 5.6-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. Introduction of the \ncorresponding substitutions (F480L and V557L) into SARS-CoV resulted in 6-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to remdesivir cell culture and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. \n \nThe cell culture development of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to remdesivir has not been assessed to date. \nNo clinical data are available on the development of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to remdesivir. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical trials in patients with COVID-19 \n \nNIAID ACTT-1 Study (CO-US-540-5776) \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated remdesivir 200 mg once daily \nfor 1 day followed by remdesivir 100 mg once daily for up to 9 days (for a total of up to 10 days of \nintravenously administered therapy) in hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 with evidence of \nlower respiratory tract involvement. The trial enrolled 1,063 hospitalised patients: 120 (11.3%) \npatients with mild/moderate disease (defined by SpO2 >94% and respiratory rate <24 breaths/min \nwithout supplemental oxygen) and 943 (88.7%) patients with severe disease (defined by SpO2 ≤94% \non room air, or respiratory rate ≥24 breaths/min and requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsupport). Patients were randomised 1:1, stratified by disease severity at enrolment, to receive \nremdesivir (n=541) or placebo (n=522), plus standard of care. \n \nThe baseline mean age was 59 years and 36% of patients were aged 65 or older. Sixty-four percent \nwere male, 53% were White, 21% were Black, 13% were Asian. The most common comorbidities \nwere hypertension (49.6%), obesity (37.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (29.7%), and coronary artery \ndisease (11.6%). \n \nApproximately 33% (180/541) of the patients received a 10-day treatment course with remdesivir. \n \nThe primary clinical endpoint was time to recovery within 28 days after randomisation, defined as \neither discharged from hospital (with or without limitations of activity and with or without home \noxygen requirements) or hospitalised but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring \nongoing medical care. In an analysis performed after all patients had been followed up for 14 days, the \nmedian time to recovery in the overall population was 11 days in the remdesivir group compared to \n15 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.32; [95% CI 1.12 to 1.55], p<0.001). The outcome \ndiffered relevantly between the two strata. In the severe disease stratum time to recovery was 12 days \nin the remdesivir group and 18 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.37 [95% CI: 1.15 to \n1.63]; Table 3). For the mild/moderate disease stratum, time to recovery was not different between the \ntwo groups (5 days for both, remdesivir and placebo). \n \nTable 3: Recovery outcomes in the severe disease stratum from NIAID ACTT-1 \n Remdesivir (N=476) Placebo (N=464) \n\nDays to recovery \nNumber of recoveries 282 227 \n\nMedian (95 %CI) 12 (10; 14) 18 (15; 21) \nRecovery rate ratio (95% CI)a 1.37 (1.15; 1.63) \n\na Recovery rate ratio calculated from the stratified Cox model. Recovery rate ratios >1 indicate \nbenefit for remdesivir \n\n \nThere was no difference in efficacy in patients randomized during the first 10 days after onset of \nsymptoms as compared to those with symptoms for more than 10 days. \nThe clinical benefit of remdesivir was most apparent in patients receiving oxygen, however, not on \nventilation, at Day 1 (rate recovery ratio 1.47 [95% CI 1.17–1.84]). For patients who were receiving \nmechanical ventilation or ECMO on Day 1 no difference in recovery rate was observed between the \ntreatment groups (0.95 [95% CI 0.64 to 1.42]). \n \nQT \nCurrent non-clinical and clinical data do not suggest a risk of QT prolongation, but QT prolongation \nhas not been fully evaluated in humans. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \nwill review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be \nupdated as necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nremdesivir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population (see section 4.2 and 5.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of remdesivir has been investigated in healthy volunteers. No \npharmacokinetic data is available from patients with COVID-19. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of remdesivir and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-441524 \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects. Following intravenous administration of remdesivir \nadult dosage regimen, peak plasma concentration was observed at end of infusion, regardless of dose \nlevel, and declined rapidly thereafter with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. Peak plasma \nconcentrations of GS-441524 were observed at 1.5 to 2.0 hours post start of a 30 minutes infusion. \n \nDistribution \n \nRemdesivir is approximately 88% bound to human plasma proteins. Protein binding of GS-441524 \nwas low (2% bound) in human plasma. After a single 150 mg dose of [14C]-remdesivir in healthy \nsubjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.68 at 15 minutes from \nstart of infusion, increased over time reaching ratio of 1.0 at 5 hours, indicating differential distribution \nof remdesivir and its metabolites to plasma or cellular components of blood. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRemdesivir is extensively metabolized to the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog triphosphate \nGS-443902 (formed intracellularly). The metabolic activation pathway involves hydrolysis by \nesterases, which leads to the formation of the intermediate metabolite, GS-704277. Phosphoramidate \ncleavage followed by phosphorylation forms the active triphosphate, GS-443902. Dephosphorylation \nof all phosphorylated metabolites can result in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 that \nitself is not efficiently re-phosphorylated. The human mass balance study also indicates presence of a \ncurrently unidentified major metabolite (M27) in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 150 mg IV dose of [14C]-remdesivir, mean total recovery of the dose was 92%, \nconsisting of approximately 74% and 18% recovered in urine and feces, respectively. The majority of \nthe remdesivir dose recovered in urine was GS-441524 (49%), while 10% was recovered as remdesivir. \nThese data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-441524. The median \nterminal half-lives of remdesivir and GS-441524 were approximately 1 and 27 hours, respectively. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender, race and age \nPharmacokinetic differences for gender, race, and age have not been evaluated. \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients have not been evaluated. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in renal impairment has not been evaluated. \nRemdesivir is not cleared unchanged in urine to any substantial extent, but its main metabolite \nGS-441524 is renally cleared and the metabolite levels in plasma may theoretically increase in patients \nwith impaired renal function. The excipient betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is renally cleared and \naccumulates in patients with decreased renal function. Veklury should not be used in patients with \neGFR <30 mL/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in hepatic impairment has not been evaluated. \nThe role of the liver in the metabolism of remdesivir is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nInteractions \nThe potential of interaction of remdesivir as a victim was not studied with regards to the inhibition of \nthe hydrolytic pathway (esterase). The risk of clinically relevant interaction is unknown. \n \nRemdesivir inhibited CYP3A4 in vitro (see section 4.5). At physiologically relevant concentrations \n(steady-state), remdesivir or its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277 did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, \n2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 in vitro. Remdesivir may however transiently inhibit CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9 \nand 2D6 on the first day of administration. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was not studied. \nThe potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP450 enzymes by remdesivir was not studied. \n \nRemdesivir induced CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A4, but not CYP2B6 in vitro (see section 4.5). \n \nIn vitro data indicates no clinically relevant inhibition of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 by \nremdesivir or its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277. \n \nRemdesivir inhibited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro (see section 4.5). No data is available for \nOAT1, OAT3 or OCT2 inhibition by remdesivir. \n \nAt physiologically relevant concentrations, remdesivir and its metabolites did not inhibit PgP and \nBCRP in vitro. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology \nFollowing intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to rhesus monkeys and rats, severe \nrenal toxicity occurred after short treatment durations. In male rhesus monkeys at dosage levels of 5, \n10, and 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days resulted, at all dose levels, in increased mean urea nitrogen and \nincreased mean creatinine, renal tubular atrophy, and basophilia and casts, and an unscheduled death \nof one animal at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level. In rats, dosage levels of >3 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks \nresulted in findings indicative of kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Systemic exposures (AUC) of the \npredominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) were 0.1 times (monkeys at \n5 mg/kg/day) and 0.3 times (rat at 3 mg/kg/day) the exposure in humans at the RHD. An unidentified \nmajor metabolite (M27) was shown to be present in human plasma (see section 5.2). The exposure of \nM27 in rhesus monkeys and rats is unknown. Animal studies may therefore not be informative of \npotential risks associated with this metabolite. \n \nCarcinogenesis \nLong-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of remdesivir have not been performed. \n \nMutagenesis \nRemdesivir was not genotoxic in a battery of assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome \naberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat micronucleus assays. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nIn female rats, decreases in corpora lutea, numbers of implantation sites, and viable embryos, were \nseen when remdesivir was administered intravenously daily at a systemically toxic dose (10 mg/kg/day) \n14 days prior to mating and during conception; exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite \n(GS-441524) were 1.3 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. There were no effects on female \nreproductive performance (mating, fertility, and conception) at this dose level. \n \nIn rats and rabbits, remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryofoetal development when \nadministered to pregnant animals at systemic exposures (AUC) of the predominant circulating \nmetabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were up to 4 times the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended human dose (RHD). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nIn rats, there were no adverse effects on pre- and post-natal development at systemic exposures (AUC) \nof the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were similar to the exposure \nin humans at the recommended human dose (RHD). \n \nIt is unknown if the active nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-443902 and the unidentified major \nhuman metabolite M27 are formed in rats and rabbits. The reproductive toxicity studies may therefore \nnot be informative of potential risks associated with these metabolites. \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate). \nWhite to off-white to yellow powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVeklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and \nadolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) with pneumonia requiring \nsupplemental oxygen (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nUse of remdesivir is confined to healthcare facilities in which patients can be monitored closely (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended dosage of remdesivir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least \n40 kg is: \n• Day 1 – single loading dose of remdesivir 200 mg given by intravenous infusion \n• Day 2 onwards – 100 mg given once daily by intravenous infusion. \n \nThe total duration of treatment should be at least 5 days and not more than 10 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of remdesivir is required in patients over the age of 65 years (see sections 5.1 and \n5.2). \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment. \nPatients with eGFR ≥30 mL/min have received remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 with no dose \nadjustment. Remdesivir should not be used in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. It is \nnot known if dosage adjustment is appropriate in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of remdesivir in children under the age of 12 years and weighing <40 kg have \nnot yet been established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intravenous use. \n \nRemdesivir is for administration by intravenous infusion after reconstitution and further dilution. \n \nIt must not be given as an intramuscular (IM) injection. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \nTable 1: Recommended rate of infusion – for reconstituted and diluted remdesivir powder \n\nfor concentrate for solution for infusion \n\nInfusion Bag Volume Infusion Time Rate of Infusion \n\n250 mL \n30 min 8.33 mL/min \n60 min 4.17 mL/min \n\n120 min 2.08 mL/min \n\n100 mL \n30 min 3.33 mL/min \n60 min 1.67 mL/min \n\n120 min 0.83 mL/min \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions \n \nHypersensitivity reactions including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions have been observed \nduring and following administration of remdesivir. Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, \nhypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, \nvomiting, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates, with a maximum infusion time of up to \n120 minutes, can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms. If signs and \nsymptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur, immediately discontinue \nadministration of remdesivir and initiate appropriate treatment. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTransaminase elevations \n \nTransaminase elevations have been observed in the remdesivir clinical trials, including in healthy \nvolunteers and patients with COVID-19. Liver function should be determined in all patients prior to \nstarting remdesivir and should be monitored while receiving it as clinically appropriate. No clinical \nstudies with remdesivir have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Remdesivir should \nonly be used in patients with hepatic impairment if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. \n• Remdesivir should not be initiated in patients with Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥5 times \n\nthe upper limit of normal at baseline \n• Remdesivir should be discontinued in patients who develop: \n\n◦ ALT ≥5 times the upper limit of normal during treatment with remdesivir. It may be \nrestarted when ALT is <5 times the upper limit of normal. \nOR \n\n◦ ALT elevation accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing \nconjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international normalised ratio (INR) (see \nsections 4.8 and 5.2). \n\n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn animal studies on rats and monkeys, severe renal toxicity was observed (see section 5.3). The \nmechanism of this renal toxicity is not fully understood. A relevance for humans cannot be excluded. \n \nAll patients should have eGFR determined prior to starting remdesivir and while receiving it as \nclinically appropriate. Remdesivir should not be used in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min. \n \nExcipients \n \nRemdesivir contains betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, which is renally cleared and accumulates in \npatients with decreased renal function, which may potentially adversely affect renal function. \nTherefore remdesivir should not be used in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min (see section 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nRisk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine  \n \nCoadministration of remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not \nrecommended based on in vitro data demonstrating an antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the \nintracellular metabolic activation and antiviral activity of remdesivir (see section 4.5, 5.1) \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo clinical interaction studies have been performed with remdesivir. The overall potential for \ninteractions is currently unknown; patients should remain under close observation during the days of \nremdesivir administration. Due to antagonism observed in vitro, concomitant use of remdesivir with \nchloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not recommended. \n \nEffects of other medicinal products on remdesivir \n \nIn vitro, remdesivir is a substrate for esterases in plasma and tissue, drug metabolizing enzymes \nCYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and is a substrate for Organic Anion Transporting \nPolypeptides 1B1 (OATP1B1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. \n \nThe potential of interaction of remdesivir with inhibitors/inducers of the hydrolytic pathway (esterase) \nor CYP2C8, 2D6 or 3A4 has not been studied. The risk of clinically relevant interaction is unknown. \nStrong inhibitors may result in increased remdesivir exposure. The use of strong inducers (e.g. \nrifampicin) may decrease plasma concentrations of remdesivir and is not recommended. \n \nDexamethasone is reported to be a moderate inducer of CYP3A and P-gp. Induction is dose-dependent \nand occurs after multiple doses. Dexamethasone is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on \n\n\n\n17 \n\nremdesivir as remdesivir has a moderate-high hepatic extraction ratio, and is used for a short duration \nin the treatment of COVID-19.  \n \nEffects of remdesivir on other medicinal products \n \nIn vitro, remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The clinical relevance of \nthese in vitro drug interactions has not been established. Remdesivir may transiently increase plasma \nconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A or OATP 1B1/1B3. No data is \navailable, however it can be suggested that medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 or \nsubstrates of OATP 1B1/1B3 should be administered at least 2 hours after remdesivir. Remdesivir \ninduced CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of remdesivir with CYP1A2 or \nCYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index may lead to loss of their efficacy. \n \nDexamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although remdesivir inhibits CYP3A4, due to \nremdesivir's rapid clearance after I.V administration, remdesivir is unlikely to have a significant effect \non dexamethasone exposure. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of remdesivir in pregnant women. Animal studies \nare insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Remdesivir should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the women requires treatment with it. \n \nWomen of child-bearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether remdesivir is excreted in human milk or the effects on the breast-fed infant, or \nthe effects on milk production. \n \nIn animal studies, the nucleoside analog metabolite GS-441524 has been detected in the blood of \nnursing rat pups of mothers given remedesivir. Therefore, excretion of remdesivir and/or metabolites \ninto the milk of lactating animals can be assumed. \n \nBecause of the potential for viral transmission to SARS-CoV-2-negative infants and adverse reactions \nfrom the drug in breast-feeding infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding \nor to discontinue/abstain from remdesivir therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for \nthe child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of remdesivir on fertility are available. In male rats, there was no effect \non mating or fertility with remdesivir treatment. In female rats, however, an impairment of fertility \nwas observed (see section 5.3). The relevance for humans is unknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nRemdesivir is predicted to have no or negligible influence on these abilities. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reaction in healthy volunteers is increased transaminases (14%). The most \ncommon adverse reaction in patients with COVID-19 is nausea (4%). \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies \nare defined as follows: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to \n<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). \n \nTable 2: Tabulated list of adverse reactions \nFrequency Adverse reaction \n\nImmune system disorders \nRare hypersensitivity \nNervous system disorders \nCommon headache \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon nausea \nHepatobiliary disorders \nVery common transaminases increased \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon rash \nInjury, poisoning and procedural complications \nRare infusion-related reaction \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTransaminases Increased \nIn healthy volunteer studies, increases in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or both in subjects \nwho received remdesivir were grade 1 (10%) or grade 2 (4%). In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled clinical study of patients with COVID-19 (NIAID ACTT-1), the incidence of grade ≥3 non-\nserious adverse events of increased aminotransferase levels including ALT, AST, or both was 4% in \npatients receiving remdesivir compared with 6% in receiving placebo. In a randomised, open-label \nmulti-centre clinical trial (Study GS-US-540-5773) in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 \nreceiving remdesivir for 5 (n=200) or 10 days (n=197), any grade (≥1.25 × upper limit of normal \n(ULN)) laboratory abnormalities of increased AST and increased ALT occurred in 40% and 42% of \npatients, respectively, receiving remdesivir. Grade ≥3 (≥5.0 × ULN) laboratory abnormalities of \nincreased AST and increased ALT both occurred in 7% of patients receiving remdesivir. In a \nrandomised, open-label multi-centre clinical trial (Study GS-US-540-5774) in hospitalised patients \nwith moderate COVID-19 receiving remdesivir for 5 (n=191) or 10 days (n=193) compared to \nstandard of care (n=200), any grade laboratory abnormalities of increased AST and increased ALT \noccurred in 32% and 33% of patients, respectively, receiving remdesivir, and 33% and 39% of patients, \nrespectively, receiving standard of care. Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities of increased AST and \nincreased ALT occurred in 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, receiving remdesivir and 6% and 7%, \nrespectively, receiving standard of care. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nTreatment of overdose with remdesivir should consist of general supportive measures including \nmonitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific \nantidote for overdose with remdesivir. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, other antivirals, ATC \ncode: not yet assigned \n \nMechanism of action \n \nRemdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that is metabolized within host cells to form the \npharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite. Remdesivir triphosphate acts as an \nanalog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate for incorporation \ninto nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in \ndelayed chain termination during replication of the viral RNA. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nRemdesivir exhibited in vitro activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in primary human \nairway epithelial cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 9.9 nM after 48 hours of treatment. \nThe EC50 values of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells were 137 nM at 24 hours and \n750 nM at 48 hours post-treatment. The antiviral activity of remdesivir was antagonised by \nchloroquine phosphate in a dose-dependent manner when the two drugs were co-incubated at clinically \nrelevant concentrations in HEp-2 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Higher \nremdesivir EC50 values were observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate. \nIncreasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate reduced formation of remdesivir triphosphate in \nnormal human bronchial epithelial cells. \n \nResistance \n \nCell culture resistance profiling of remdesivir using the rodent CoV murine hepatitis virus identified \n2 substitutions (F476L and V553L) in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase at residues \nconserved across CoVs that conferred 5.6-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. Introduction of the \ncorresponding substitutions (F480L and V557L) into SARS-CoV resulted in 6-fold reduced \nsusceptibility to remdesivir cell culture and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. \n \nThe cell culture development of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to remdesivir has not been assessed to date. \nNo clinical data are available on the development of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to remdesivir. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical trials in patients with COVID-19 \n \nNIAID ACTT-1 Study (CO-US-540-5776) \nA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated remdesivir 200 mg once daily \nfor 1 day followed by remdesivir 100 mg once daily for up to 9 days (for a total of up to 10 days of \nintravenously administered therapy) in hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 with evidence of \nlower respiratory tract involvement. The trial enrolled 1,063 hospitalised patients: 120 (11.3%) \npatients with mild/moderate disease (defined by SpO2 >94% and respiratory rate <24 breaths/min \nwithout supplemental oxygen) and 943 (88.7%) patients with severe disease (defined by SpO2 ≤94% \non room air, or respiratory rate ≥24 breaths/min and requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory \n\n\n\n20 \n\nsupport). Patients were randomised 1:1, stratified by disease severity at enrolment, to receive \nremdesivir (n=541) or placebo (n=522), plus standard of care. \n \nThe baseline mean age was 59 years and 36% of patients were aged 65 or older. Sixty-four percent \nwere male, 53% were White, 21% were Black, 13% were Asian. The most common comorbidities \nwere hypertension (49.6%), obesity (37.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (29.7%), and coronary artery \ndisease (11.6%). \n \nApproximately 33% (180/541) of the patients received a 10-day treatment course with remdesivir. \n \nThe primary clinical endpoint was time to recovery within 28 days after randomisation, defined as \neither discharged from hospital (with or without limitations of activity and with or without home \noxygen requirements) or hospitalised but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring \nongoing medical care. In an analysis performed after all patients had been followed up for 14 days, the \nmedian time to recovery in the overall population was 11 days in the remdesivir group compared to \n15 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.32; [95% CI 1.12 to 1.55], p<0.001). The outcome \ndiffered relevantly between the two strata. In the severe disease stratum time to recovery was 12 days \nin the remdesivir group and 18 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio 1.37 [95% CI: 1.15 to \n1.63]; Table 3). For the mild/moderate disease stratum, time to recovery was not different between the \ntwo groups (5 days for both, remdesivir and placebo). \n \nTable 3: Recovery outcomes in the severe disease stratum from NIAID ACTT-1 \n Remdesivir (N=476) Placebo (N=464) \n\nDays to recovery \nNumber of recoveries 282 227 \n\nMedian (95 %CI) 12 (10; 14) 18 (15; 21) \nRecovery rate ratio (95% CI)a 1.37 (1.15; 1.63) \n\na Recovery rate ratio calculated from the stratified Cox model. Recovery rate ratios >1 indicate \nbenefit for remdesivir \n\n \nThere was no difference in efficacy in patients randomized during the first 10 days after onset of \nsymptoms as compared to those with symptoms for more than 10 days. \nThe clinical benefit of remdesivir was most apparent in patients receiving oxygen, however, not on \nventilation, at Day 1 (rate recovery ratio 1.47 [95% CI 1.17–1.84]). For patients who were receiving \nmechanical ventilation or ECMO on Day 1 no difference in recovery rate was observed between the \ntreatment groups (0.95 [95% CI 0.64 to 1.42]). \n \nQT \nCurrent non-clinical and clinical data do not suggest a risk of QT prolongation, but QT prolongation \nhas not been fully evaluated in humans. \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency \nwill review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be \nupdated as necessary. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nremdesivir in one or more subsets of the paediatric population (see section 4.2 and 5.2 for information \non paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of remdesivir has been investigated in healthy volunteers. No \npharmacokinetic data is available from patients with COVID-19. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of remdesivir and the predominant circulating metabolite GS-441524 \nhave been evaluated in healthy adult subjects. Following intravenous administration of remdesivir \nadult dosage regimen, peak plasma concentration was observed at end of infusion, regardless of dose \nlevel, and declined rapidly thereafter with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. Peak plasma \nconcentrations of GS-441524 were observed at 1.5 to 2.0 hours post start of a 30 minutes infusion. \n \nDistribution \n \nRemdesivir is approximately 88% bound to human plasma proteins. Protein binding of GS-441524 \nwas low (2% bound) in human plasma. After a single 150 mg dose of [14C]-remdesivir in healthy \nsubjects, the blood to plasma ratio of 14C-radioactivity was approximately 0.68 at 15 minutes from \nstart of infusion, increased over time reaching ratio of 1.0 at 5 hours, indicating differential distribution \nof remdesivir and its metabolites to plasma or cellular components of blood. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nRemdesivir is extensively metabolized to the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog triphosphate \nGS-443902 (formed intracellularly). The metabolic activation pathway involves hydrolysis by \nesterases, which leads to the formation of the intermediate metabolite, GS-704277. Phosphoramidate \ncleavage followed by phosphorylation forms the active triphosphate, GS-443902. Dephosphorylation \nof all phosphorylated metabolites can result in the formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 that \nitself is not efficiently re-phosphorylated. The human mass balance study also indicates presence of a \ncurrently unidentified major metabolite (M27) in plasma. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single 150 mg IV dose of [14C]-remdesivir, mean total recovery of the dose was 92%, \nconsisting of approximately 74% and 18% recovered in urine and feces, respectively. The majority of \nthe remdesivir dose recovered in urine was GS-441524 (49%), while 10% was recovered as remdesivir. \nThese data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for GS-441524. The median \nterminal half-lives of remdesivir and GS-441524 were approximately 1 and 27 hours, respectively. \n \nOther special populations \n \nGender, race and age \nPharmacokinetic differences for gender, race, and age have not been evaluated. \n \nPaediatric patients \nThe pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients have not been evaluated. \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in renal impairment has not been evaluated. \nRemdesivir is not cleared unchanged in urine to any substantial extent, but its main metabolite \nGS-441524 is renally cleared and the metabolite levels in plasma may theoretically increase in patients \nwith impaired renal function. The excipient betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is renally cleared and \naccumulates in patients with decreased renal function. Veklury should not be used in patients with \neGFR <30 mL/min. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in hepatic impairment has not been evaluated. \nThe role of the liver in the metabolism of remdesivir is unknown. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nInteractions \nThe potential of interaction of remdesivir as a victim was not studied with regards to the inhibition of \nthe hydrolytic pathway (esterase). The risk of clinically relevant interaction is unknown. \n \nRemdesivir inhibited CYP3A4 in vitro (see section 4.5). At physiologically relevant concentrations \n(steady-state), remdesivir or its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277 did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, \n2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 in vitro. Remdesivir may however transiently inhibit CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9 \nand 2D6 on the first day of administration. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was not studied. \nThe potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP450 enzymes by remdesivir was not studied. \n \nRemdesivir induced CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A4, but not CYP2B6 in vitro (see section 4.5). \n \nIn vitro data indicates no clinically relevant inhibition of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 or 2B7 by \nremdesivir or its metabolites GS-441524 and GS-704277. \n \nRemdesivir inhibited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro (see section 4.5). No data is available for \nOAT1, OAT3 or OCT2 inhibition by remdesivir. \n \nAt physiologically relevant concentrations, remdesivir and its metabolites did not inhibit PgP and \nBCRP in vitro. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nToxicology \nFollowing intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to rhesus monkeys and rats, severe \nrenal toxicity occurred after short treatment durations. In male rhesus monkeys at dosage levels of 5, \n10, and 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days resulted, at all dose levels, in increased mean urea nitrogen and \nincreased mean creatinine, renal tubular atrophy, and basophilia and casts, and an unscheduled death \nof one animal at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level.In rats, dosage levels of >3 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks \nresulted in findings indicative of kidney injury and/or dysfunction. Systemic exposures (AUC) of the \npredominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) were 0.1 times (monkeys at \n5 mg/kg/day) and 0.3 times (rat at 3 mg/kg/day) the exposure in humans at the RHD. An unidentified \nmajor metabolite (M27) was shown to be present in human plasma (see section 5.2). The exposure of \nM27 in rhesus monkeys and rats is unknown. Animal studies may therefore not be informative of \npotential risks associated with this metabolite. \n \nCarcinogenesis \nLong-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of remdesivir have not been performed. \n \nMutagenesis \nRemdesivir was not genotoxic in a battery of assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome \naberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat micronucleus assays. \n \nReproductive toxicity \nIn female rats, decreases in corpora lutea, numbers of implantation sites, and viable embryos, were \nseen when remdesivir was administered intravenously daily at a systemically toxic dose (10 mg/kg/day) \n14 days prior to mating and during conception; exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite \n(GS-441524) were 1.3 times the exposure in humans at the RHD. There were no effects on female \nreproductive performance (mating, fertility, and conception) at this dose level. \n \nIn rats and rabbits, remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryofoetal development when \nadministered to pregnant animals at systemic exposures (AUC) of the predominant circulating \nmetabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were up to 4 times the exposure in humans at the \nrecommended human dose (RHD). \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nIn rats, there were no adverse effects on pre- and post-natal development at systemic exposures (AUC) \nof the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were similar to the exposure \nin humans at the recommended human dose (RHD). \n \nIt is unknown if the active nucleoside analog triphosphate GS-443902 and the unidentified major \nhuman metabolite M27 are formed in rats and rabbits. The reproductive toxicity studies may therefore \nnot be informative of potential risks associated with these metabolites. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you are given Veklury \n3. How Veklury is given to you \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Veklury \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Veklury is and what it is used for \n \nThe active substance in is remdesivir. It is an antiviral medicine used for treating COVID-19. \n \nCOVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. Veklury stops the virus multiplying in cells and \nthis stops the virus multiplying in the body. This can help your body to overcome the virus infection, \nand may help you get better faster. \n \nVeklury will be given to people with COVID-19. It is suitable for adults and adolescents (aged 12 and \nover who weigh 40 kg or more). It will only be given to patients who have pneumonia, and need extra \noxygen to help them breathe. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Veklury \n \nYou will not usually be given Veklury: \n• if you are allergic to remdesivir, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6) \n➔ Talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible, if this applies to you. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before starting on Veklury: \n• if you have liver problems. Some people developed increased liver enzymes when given \n\nVeklury. Your doctor will do blood tests before starting treatment to check whether you can be \ngiven it safely. \n\n• if you have kidney problems. Some people with severe kidney problems may not be given this \nmedicine. Your doctor will do blood tests to check whether you can be given it safely. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nReactions following the infusion \nVeklury can cause allergic reactions or reactions following the infusion. Symptoms can include: \n\n• Changes to blood pressure or heart rate. \n• Low oxygen level in blood \n• High temperature \n• Shortness of breath, wheezing \n• Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n• Rash \n• Feeling sick (nausea) \n• Sweating \n• Shivering. \n\n \n➔ Tell your doctor if you get any of these signs or symptoms. \n \nBlood tests before and during treatment \nIf you are prescribed Veklury, you will be given blood tests before treatment starts. Patients being \ntreated with Veklury will have blood tests during their treatment as determined by their health care \nprovider. These tests are to check for kidney or liver problems. Veklury will be stopped if your kidney \nor liver show signs of damage during treatment. See Possible side effects, below. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVeklury is not to be given to children under 12 years who weigh less than 40 kg. Not enough is known \nfor it to be given to these children. \n \nOther medicines and Veklury \nTell your doctor or nurse about any other medicines you are taking, or have recently taken. \n \nDo not take chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at the same time as remdesivir. \n \nCertain medicines e.g. midazolam or pitavastatin should be taken at least 2 hours after Veklury as \nVeklury can affect the way they work. \n \nVeklury may affect the way certain medicines (e.g. theophylline or midazolam) work. \n \n➔ Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines \n \nVeklury can be used with dexamethasone. \n \nIt is not yet known if Veklury affects other medicines, or is affected by them. Your healthcare team \nwill monitor you for signs of medicines affecting each other. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, or if you might be. There is not enough information \nto be sure that Veklury is safe for use in pregnancy. Veklury will only be given if the potential benefits \nof treatment outweigh the potential risks to the mother and the unborn child. You must use effective \ncontraception while having remdesivir treatment. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are breast-feeding. It is not yet known whether Veklury or the \nCOVID-19 virus pass into human breast milk, or what the effects might be on the baby or milk \nproduction. Your doctor will help you decide whether to continue breast-feeding or to start treatment \nwith Veklury. You will need to consider the potential benefits of treatment for you, compared with the \nhealth benefits and risks of breast-feeding for your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVeklury is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nVeklury contains a cyclodextrin \nThis medicine contains 6 g betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium in each 100 mg dose of Veklury (12 g in \nthe starting dose). This ingredient is a cyclodextrin emulsifier that helps the medicine to disperse in the \nbody. \n \n \n3. How Veklury is given to you \n \nVeklury will be given to you by a nurse or doctor, as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion) \nlasting 30 to 120 minutes, once a day. You will be closely monitored during your treatment. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• a single starting dose of 200 mg on day 1 \n• then daily doses of 100 mg starting on day 2. \n \nYou will be given Veklury every day for at least 5 days. Your doctor may extend the treatment up to \na total of 10 days. \n \nSee the Instructions for healthcare professionals which give details on how the Veklury infusion is \ngiven. \n \nIf you are given more or less Veklury than you should be \nAs Veklury is only given to you by a healthcare provider, it is unlikely that you will be given too much \nor too little. If you have been given an extra dose, or missed one, tell your nurse or doctor straight \naway. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nVery common side effects \n(these may affect more than 1 in 10 patients) \n• Blood tests may show an increase in liver enzymes, called transaminases. \n \nCommon side effects \n(these may affect up to 1 in 10 patients) \n• Headache \n• Feeling sick (nausea) \n• Rash \n \nRare side effects \n(these may affect up to 1 in 1000 patients) \n• Allergic reactions or reactions following the infusion. Symptoms can include: \n\n• Changes to blood pressure or heart rate \n• Low oxygen level in blood \n• High temperature \n• Shortness of breath, wheezing \n• Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n• Rash \n• Feeling sick (nausea) \n• Sweating \n• Shivering \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you notice any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse.

Symptoms can include: \n\n• Changes to blood pressure or heart rate. \n• Low oxygen level in blood \n• High temperature \n• Shortness of breath, wheezing \n• Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat (angioedema) \n• Rash \n• Feeling sick (nausea) \n• Sweating \n• Shivering. \n\n \n➔ Tell your doctor if you get any of these signs or symptoms \n \nBlood tests before and during treatment \nIf you are prescribed Veklury, you will be given blood tests before treatment starts. Patients being \ntreated with Veklury will have blood tests during their treatment as determined by their health care \nprovider. These tests are to check for kidney or liver problems. Veklury will be stopped if your kidney \nor liver show signs of damage during treatment. See Possible side effects, below. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nVeklury is not to be given to children under 12 years who weigh less than 40 kg. Not enough is known \nfor it to be given to these children. \n \nOther medicines and Veklury \nTell your doctor or nurse about any other medicines you are taking, or have recently taken. \n \nDo not take chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at the same time as remdesivir. \n \nCertain medicines e.g. midazolam or pitavastatin should be taken at least 2 hours after Veklury as \nVeklury can affect the way they work. \n \nVeklury may affect the way certain medicines (e.g. theophylline or midazolam) work. \n \n➔ Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines \n \nVeklury can be used with dexamethasone. \n \nIt is not yet known if Veklury affects other medicines, or is affected by them. Your healthcare team \nwill monitor you for signs of medicines affecting each other. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are pregnant, or if you might be. There is not enough information \nto be sure that Veklury is safe for use in pregnancy. Veklury will only be given if the potential benefits \nof treatment outweigh the potential risks to the mother and the unborn child. You must use effective \ncontraception while having remdesivir treatment. \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are breast-feeding. It is not yet known whether Veklury or the \nCOVID-19 virus pass into human breast milk, or what the effects might be on the baby or milk \nproduction. Your doctor will help you decide whether to continue breast-feeding or to start treatment \nwith Veklury. You will need to consider the potential benefits of treatment for you, compared with the \nhealth benefits and risks of breast-feeding for your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVeklury is not expected to have any effect on your ability to drive. \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nVeklury contains a cyclodextrin \nThis medicine contains 3 g betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium in each 100 mg dose of Veklury (6 g in the \nstarting dose). This ingredient is a cyclodextrin emulsifier that helps the medicine to disperse in the \nbody. \n \n \n3. How Veklury is given to you \n \nVeklury will be given to you by a nurse or doctor, as a drip into a vein (an intravenous infusion) \nlasting 30 to 120 minutes, once a day. You will be closely monitored during your treatment. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \n• a single starting dose of 200 mg on day 1 \n• then daily doses of 100 mg starting on day 2. \n \nYou will be given Veklury every day for at least 5 days. Your doctor may extend the treatment up to \na total of 10 days. \n \nSee the Instructions for healthcare professionals which give details on how the Veklury infusion is \ngiven. \n \nIf you are given more or less Veklury than you should be \nAs Veklury is only given to you by a healthcare provider, it is unlikely that you will be given too much \nor too little. If you have been given an extra dose, or missed one, tell your nurse or doctor straight \naway. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4.

Treatment can be extended to a total of up to \n\n10 days. \n \nThe powder must be reconstituted with water for injections, and then diluted with sodium chloride \nsolution 9 mg/mL (0.9%) under aseptic conditions. Administer the diluted solution immediately. \n \nAll patients must have their liver function and renal function checked before starting treatment and as \nclinically appropriate during treatment. Serum chemistries, hematology, ALT, AST, bilirubin and \nalkaline phosphatase must be checked as clinically appropriate. \n \nMonitor the patient for side effects during and after the infusion. See below for details on reporting of \nside effects. \n \nReconstitute the powder \n \nFor each single-use vial, the powder must be reconstituted and then diluted under aseptic conditions. \n• Add 19 mL of sterile water for injections to the vial, using a suitably sized syringe and needle \n\nfor each vial. This produces a solution of 5 mg/mL of remdesivir. \n◦ Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the sterile water into the vial. \n\n• Immediately shake the vial for 30 seconds. \n• Allow the contents of the vial to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. A clear solution should result. \n• If the contents of the vial are not completely dissolved, shake the vial again for 30 seconds and \n\nallow the contents to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat this procedure as necessary until the \ncontents of the vial are completely dissolved. \n\n• Inspect the vial to ensure the container closure is free from defects. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n53 \n\n• The solution should only be used if it is clear and free from particles. \n• Dilute immediately after reconstitution. \n \nDilute the concentrate with sodium chloride solution \n \nReconstituted Veklury must be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection \nunder aseptic conditions. \n \nUsing Table 1, decide how much sodium chloride solution 9 mg/mL (0.9%) to withdraw from the \ninfusion bag. \n \nTable 1: Dilution instructions \n\nDose \nSize of infusion \nbag to be used \n\nHow much sodium \nchloride solution to \n\nwithdraw and \ndiscard from \ninfusion bag \n\nVolume of \nreconstituted \n\nVeklury \n200 mg \n(2 vials) \n\n250 mL 40 mL 2 × 20 mL \n100 mL 40 mL 2 × 20 mL \n\n100 mg \n(1 vial) \n\n250 mL 20 mL 20 mL \n100 mL 20 mL 20 mL \n\nNote: 100 mL infusion should only be used for patients with severe fluid restrictions. \n \n• Withdraw and discard the required volume of sodium chloride solution from the infusion bag \n\nusing an appropriately sized syringe and needle.
