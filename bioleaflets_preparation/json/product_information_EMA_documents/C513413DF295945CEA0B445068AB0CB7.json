PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n \nSymkevi 50 mg/75 mg film coated tablets \n \nWhite, capsule-shaped tablet debossed with “V50” on one side and plain on the other (dimensions \n12.70 mm x 6.78 mm) \n \nSymkevi 100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets \n \nYellow, capsule-shaped tablet debossed with “V100” on one side and plain on the other (dimensions \n15.9 mm x 8.5 mm) \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSymkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of patients with \ncystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are \nheterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis \ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, \n711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nSymkevi should only be prescribed by physicians with experience in the treatment of CF. If the \npatient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to \nconfirm the presence of an indicated mutation using a genotyping assay. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPosology \n \nAdults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 years and older \nAge Morning \n\n(1 tablet) \nEvening \n(1 tablet) \n\n6 to < 12 years weighing < 30 kg tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg ivacaftor 75 mg \n6 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 30 kg tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg ivacaftor 150 mg \n≥ 12 years tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg ivacaftor 150 mg \n\n \nThe morning and evening dose should be taken approximately 12 hours apart with fat-containing food \n(see Method of administration). \n \nMissed dose \n \nIf 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should take the \nmissed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule. \n \nIf more than 6 hours have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should not \ntake the missed dose. The next scheduled dose can be taken at the usual time. \n \nMore than one dose of either tablet should not be taken at the same time. \n \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors \n \nThe dose of Symkevi and ivacaftor should be adjusted when co-administered with moderate and \nstrong CYP3A inhibitors. \n \nWhen co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, verapamil), \nor strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, \ntelithromycin, and clarithromycin),  the dose should be reduced according to Table 2 (see sections 4.4 \nand 4.5). \n \n\nTable 2: Dosing recommendations for concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A \ninhibitors \n Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors \n6 years to < 12 years,  \n< 30 kg \n\nAlternate each morning:  \n- one tablet of tezacaftor \n\n50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg on \nthe first day  \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor \n75 mg on the next day.   \n\nContinue alternating tablets \neach day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor \n75 mg twice a week, \napproximately 3 to 4 days \napart.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n6 years < 12 years, \n≥ 30 kg \n\nAlternate each morning:  \n- one tablet of tezacaftor \n\n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg \nonce daily on the first day \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor \n150 mg on the next day.   \n\nContinue alternating each day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor \n150 mg twice a week, \napproximately 3 to 4 days \napart. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Dosing recommendations for concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A \ninhibitors \n Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Strong CYP3A inhibitors \n12 years and older Alternate each morning:  \n\n- one tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg \nonce daily on the first day \n\n- one tablet of ivacaftor \n150 mg on the next day.   \n\nContinue alternating each day. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor \n150 mg twice a week, \napproximately 3 to 4 days \napart. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly people \n \nThe safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Symkevi have been examined in a limited number of \nelderly patients. No dose adjustment specific to this patient population is required (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is \nrecommended in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and \n5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFor dose adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment, see Table 3. There is no experience of the \nuse of Symkevi in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, its use is \nnot recommended unless the benefits outweigh the risks. In such cases, Symkevi should be used at a \nreduced dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for Symkevi in patients with \nmild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). \n \n\nTable 3: Dosing recommendations for use in patients with hepatic impairment \n Moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) \n6 years to < 12 years,  \n< 30 kg \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg once \ndaily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor \n75 mg once daily or less \nfrequently.  \n \nDosing intervals should be \nmodified according to clinical \nresponse and tolerability. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n6 years to < 12 years, \n≥ 30 kg \n\nOne morning tablet of tezacaftor \n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once \ndaily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor \n150 mg once daily or less \nfrequently.  \n \nDosing intervals should be \nmodified according to clinical \nresponse and tolerability. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n\n\n5 \n\nTable 3: Dosing recommendations for use in patients with hepatic impairment \n Moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) \n12 years and older One morning tablet of tezacaftor \n\n100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg once \ndaily.  \n \nNo evening dose. \n\nOne morning tablet of \ntezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor \n150 mg once daily or less \nfrequently.  \n \nDosing intervals should be \nmodified according to clinical \nresponse and tolerability. \n \nNo evening dose. \n\n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Symkevi in children aged less than 6 years has not yet been established. No \ndata are available (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be \nchewed, crushed, or broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to \nsupport other methods of administration.  \n \nBoth Symkevi and ivacaftor tablets should be taken with fat-containing food, such as food \nrecommended in standard nutritional guidelines (see section 5.2). \n \nFood or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSymkevi should not be prescribed in patients with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation \nand have a second CFTR mutation not listed in section 4.1. \n \nEffect on liver function tests \n \nElevated transaminases are common in patients with CF, and have been observed in some patients \ntreated with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor, as well as with ivacaftor monotherapy. Therefore, \nliver functions tests are recommended for all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months \nduring the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase \nelevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. In the event of \nsignificant elevations of transaminases (e.g., patients with ALT or AST >5 x the upper limit of normal \n(ULN), or ALT or AST >3 x ULN with bilirubin >2 x ULN), dosing should be interrupted and \nlaboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution of transaminase \nelevations, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see section 4.8). \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nThe use of Symkevi is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment unless the \nbenefits are expected to outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRenal impairment \n \nCaution is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see \nsections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nPatients after organ transplantation \n \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone \norgan transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for \ninteractions with ciclosporin or tacrolimus. \n \nInteractions with medicinal products \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nExposure to tezacaftor and ivacaftor may be reduced by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, \npotentially resulting in reduced efficacy of Symkevi and ivacaftor. Therefore, co-administration with \nstrong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCYP3A inhibitors \n \nThe dose of Symkevi and ivacaftor should be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5 and Tables 2 and 3 in section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nCataracts \n \nCases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric \npatients treated with ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some \ncases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment \ncannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in \npaediatric patients initiating treatment with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor (see section 5.3). \n \nSodium content \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMedicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor \n \nCYP3A inducers \n \nTezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates of CYP3A (ivacaftor is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). \nConcomitant use of CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced efficacy of \nSymkevi and ivacaftor. Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, \nsignificantly decreased ivacaftor exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] by 89%. Tezacaftor \nexposures can also be expected to decrease significantly during co-administration with strong CYP3A \ninducers; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended. \n \nExamples of strong CYP3A inducers include rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, \nphenytoin, and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCYP3A inhibitors \n \nCo-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased tezacaftor exposure \n(measured as AUC) by 4-fold and increased ivacaftor AUC by 15.6-fold. The dose of Symkevi should \nbe adjusted when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 3 in section 4.2). \n \nExamples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and \nvoriconazole, telithromycin and clarithromycin. \n \nPhysiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling suggested co-administration with fluconazole, a \nmoderate CYP3A inhibitor, may increase tezacaftor exposure (AUC) by approximately 2-fold. \nCo-administration of fluconazole increased ivacaftor AUC by 3-fold. The dose of Symkevi and \nivacaftor should be adjusted when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 3 in \nsection 4.2). \n \nExamples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include fluconazole, erythromycin and verapamil. \n \nCo-administration with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately \ninhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ivacaftor and tezacaftor; therefore, food or drink containing \ngrapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nPotential for tezacaftor/ivacaftor to interact with transporters \n \nIn vitro studies showed that tezacaftor is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1, and efflux \ntransporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). Tezacaftor is not a substrate for \nOATP1B3. Exposure to tezacaftor is not expected to be affected significantly by concomitant \ninhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of \nbeing excreted intact. However, exposure to M2-TEZ (tezacaftor metabolite) may be increased by \ninhibitors of P-gp. Therefore, caution should be used when P-gp inhibitors are used with Symkevi. \n \nIn vitro studies showed that ivacaftor is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. Ivacaftor \nand its metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low \nlikelihood of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter \nexposure of ivacaftor and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not \nexpected to be clinically relevant. \n \nCiprofloxacin \n \nCo-administration of ciprofloxacin did not affect the exposure of ivacaftor or tezacaftor. No dose \nadjustment is required when Symkevi is co-administered with ciprofloxacin. \n \nMedicinal products affected by tezacaftor and ivacaftor \n \nCYP2C9 substrates \n \nIvacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) is \nrecommended during co-administration of warfarin with Symkevi given in combination with ivacaftor. \nOther medicinal products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; \nthese medicinal products should be used with caution. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nCYP3A, digoxin and other P-gp Substrates \n \nCYP3A substrates \n \nCo-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, did not affect midazolam \nexposure. No dose adjustment of CYP3A substrates is required when co-administered with Symkevi in \ncombination with ivacaftor. \n \nDigoxin and other P-gp substrates \n \nCo-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, \nconsistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of Symkevi in combination with \nivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, \nwhich may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used \nconcomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as \nciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. \n \nHormonal contraceptives \n \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor has been studied with an estrogen/progesterone oral \ncontraceptive and was found to have no significant effect on the exposures of the hormonal \ncontraceptive. Symkevi and ivacaftor are not expected to modify the efficacy of hormonal \ncontraceptives. \n \nOATP1B1 substrates \n \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor has been studied with pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, and \nwas found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of pitavastatin (1.24-fold increased \nexposure based on AUC).  No dose adjustment of OATP1B1 substrates is required when co-\nadministered with Symkevi.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of tezacaftor \nor ivacaftor in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with \nrespect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid \nthe use of therapy during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether tezacaftor, ivacaftor, or their metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tezacaftor and ivacaftor into \nthe milk of lactating female rats (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy \ntaking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nFertility \n \nTezacaftor \n \nThere are no data available on the effect of tezacaftor on fertility in humans. Tezacaftor had no effects \non fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at doses up to \n100 mg/kg/day. \n \nIvacaftor \n \nThere are no data available on the effect of ivacaftor on fertility in humans. Ivacaftor had an effect on \nfertility in rats (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \nDizziness has been reported in patients receiving Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor, as well as \nivacaftor monotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive \nor use machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 12 years and older who received \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor in Phase 3 clinical studies were headache (14% versus 11% on \nplacebo) and nasopharyngitis (12% versus 10% on placebo). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nTable 4 reflects adverse reaction observed with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor and with \nivacaftor monotherapy in clinical studies. Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class \nand frequency: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); \nrare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). \n \n\nTable 4: Adverse reactions  \nMedDRA System Organ \n\nClass \nAdverse reactions Frequency \n\nInfections and infestations \nUpper respiratory tract infection, \nNasopharyngitis*  very common \n\nRhinitis common \nNervous system disorders Headache*, Dizziness* very common \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nEar pain, Ear discomfort, \nTinnitus, Tympanic membrane \nhyperaemia, Vestibular disorder \n\ncommon \n\nEar congestion  uncommon \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nOropharyngeal pain, Nasal \ncongestion very common \n\nSinus congestion*, Pharyngeal \nerythema common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nAbdominal pain, Diarrhoea very common \nNausea* common \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Transaminase elevations very common \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 4: Adverse reactions  \nMedDRA System Organ \n\nClass \nAdverse reactions Frequency \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders Rash very common \n\nReproductive system and breast \ndisorders \n\nBreast mass  common \nBreast inflammation, \nGynaecomastia, Nipple disorder, \nNipple pain \n\nuncommon \n\nInvestigations Bacteria in sputum  very common \n*Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies with IVA/TEZ in combination with ivacaftor. \n\n \nThe safety data from 1042 patients 12 years and older treated with Symkevi in combination with \nivacaftor for up to an additional 96 weeks in a long-term safety and efficacy rollover study (study 3) \nwere consistent with the safety data from the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nTransaminase elevations \n \nDuring the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (up to 24 weeks), the incidence of maximum \ntransaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 x ULN were similar between Symkevi- and placebo-treated \npatients; 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in Symkevi-treated patients, and 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3.4% in \nplacebo-treated patients. One patient (0.2%) on therapy and two patients (0.4%) on placebo \npermanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases. No patients treated with Symkevi \nexperienced a transaminase elevation >3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 x ULN. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe safety of Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor was evaluated in 124 patients between 6 to less \nthan 12 years of age. The tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg dose has not been \ninvestigated in clinical trials in children aged 6 to less than 12 years weighing 30 to < 40 kg. \n\n \nThe safety profile is generally consistent among children and adolescents, and is also consistent with \nadult patients. \n \nDuring the 24-week, open-label Phase 3 study in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (study 5, n=70), \nthe incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 x ULN were 1.4%, 4.3%, and \n10.0%, respectively. No Symkevi-treated patients experienced a transaminase elevation >3 x ULN \nassociated with elevated total bilirubin >2 x ULN or discontinued Symkevi treatment due to \ntransaminase elevations. One patient interrupted treatment due to elevated transaminases, and \nsubsequently resumed Symkevi treatment successfully. (see section 4.4 for management of elevated \ntransaminases). \n \nOther special populations \n \nThe safety profile of Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor, including respiratory events (e.g., chest \ndiscomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal), was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, \nincluding analysis by age, gender, and baseline percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n\n\n11 \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no known risks due to overdose with Symkevi and there is no specific antidote available in \nthe event of overdose. Treatment of overdose consists of general supportive measures including \nmonitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products; ATC code: R07AX31 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTezacaftor is a selective CFTR corrector that binds to the first Membrane Spanning Domain (MSD-1) \nof CFTR. Tezacaftor facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal or multiple mutant \nforms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the \ncell surface, resulting in increased chloride transport in vitro.  \n \nIvacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that potentiates the channel-open probability (or gating) of CFTR at \nthe cell surface to increase chloride transport. For ivacaftor to function CFTR protein must be present \nat the cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by \ntezacaftor, leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than either active substance alone. \nThe combination targets the abnormal CFTR protein by increasing the quantity and function of CFTR \nat the cell surface and subsequently increasing airway surface liquid height, and ciliary beat frequency \nin vitro in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from homozygous F508del CF patients. The exact \nmechanisms by which tezacaftor improves cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR and \nivacaftor potentiates F508del-CFTR are not known.  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEffects on sweat chloride \n \nIn study 1 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference between Symkevi \nin combination with ivacaftor and placebo in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride \nthrough week 24, was -10.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.4, -8.8; nominal P<0.0001*). \n \nIn study 2 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with \nresidual CFTR activity), the treatment difference in mean absolute change from baseline in sweat \nchloride through week 8 was -9.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.7, -7.3; nominal P<0.0001*) between \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor and placebo, and -4.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -6.7, -2.3; nominal \nP<0.0001*) between ivacaftor and placebo. \n \nIn study 4 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who were homozygous or heterozygous for the \nF508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity), the within treatment \nmean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 8 was -12.3 mmol/L \n(95% CI: -15.3, -9.3; nominal P <0.0001). In subgroup analyses the mean absolute change \nwas -12.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -16.0, -9.9) for patients with F/F and for patients with F/RF the mean \nabsolute change was -10.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -20.8, -0.9). \n*Nominal p-value, based on hierarchical testing procedure. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\nECG evaluation \n \nNeither tezacaftor nor ivacaftor prolong the QTcF interval in healthy subjects at 3 times the \ntherapeutic dose. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe efficacy of Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg tablet in adult and adolescent patients \nwith CF was demonstrated in two Phase 3, double-blind, controlled studies (study 1 and study 2), and \none Phase 3, open-label extension study (study 3). \n \nStudy 1 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 504 patients \naged 12 years and older (mean age 26.3 years) who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the \nCFTR gene were randomised (1:1 randomization: 248 Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor, \n256 placebo). Patients had a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) at \nscreening between 40 to 90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 60.0% (range: 27.8% to 96.2%).  \n \nStudy 2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 3-treatment, 8-week crossover \nstudy. A total of 244 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 34.8 years) who were heterozygous \nfor the F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity were \nrandomised to and received sequences of treatment that included Symkevi in combination with \nivacaftor, ivacaftor, and placebo. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40 to 90%. The mean \nppFEV1 at baseline was 62.3% (range: 34.6% to 93.5%).  \n \nPatients in studies 1 and 2 continued on their standard-of-care CF therapies during the studies (e.g., \nbronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa, and hypertonic saline), and were eligible to roll over \ninto a 96-week open-label extension study (study 3). Patients had a confirmed genotype of a \nprotocol-specified CFTR mutation, and a confirmed diagnosis of CF.  \n \nPatients with a history of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in \npulmonary status such as Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, or Mycobacterium \nabscessus, or who had two or more abnormal liver function tests at screening (ALT, AST, AP, GGT \n≥3 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN) or AST or ALT ≥5 x ULN, were excluded from both studies. \n \nStudy 1  \n \nIn study 1 treatment with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant \nimprovement in ppFEV1 (Table 5). The treatment difference between Symkevi (in combination with \nivacaftor) and placebo for the primary endpoint of mean absolute change (95% CI) in ppFEV1 from \nbaseline through week 24 was 4.0 percentage points (95% CI: 3.1, 4.8; P<0.0001). Mean improvement \nin ppFEV1 was observed at the first assessment on day 15 and sustained throughout the 24-week \ntreatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1, \ncolonization with Pseudomonas, concomitant use of standard-of-care medications for CF, and \ngeographic region.

The rate ratio versus placebo was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.82; nominal P= 0.0042). Pulmonary \nexacerbations requiring IV antibiotic therapy were lower in the treatment group compared to placebo \n(RR: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.82]; nominal P=0.0042). Pulmonary exacerbations requiring \nhospitalizations were similar between treatment groups (RR: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.44, 1.36]; P=0.3801). \n \nBMI increased in both treatment groups (Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor: 0.18 kg/m2, placebo: \n0.12 kg/m2). The treatment difference of 0.06 kg/m2 for mean change in BMI from baseline to \nweek 24 (95% CI: -0.08, 0.19) was not statistically significant (P=0.4127). \n \nFor CFQ-R respiratory domain score (a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF \nincluding cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing) the percentage of subjects with at least a \n4 point-increase from baseline (minimal clinically important difference) was 51.1% for Symkevi and \n35.7% for placebo at week 24. \n \nStudy 2 \n \nOf the 244 patients enrolled in study 2 the following indicated mutations associated with residual \nCFTR activity were represented: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, \nS977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. \n \nIn study 2 treatment with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant \nimprovement in ppFEV1 (Table 6). The treatment difference between Symkevi in combination with \nivacaftor- and placebo-treated patients for the primary endpoint of mean absolute change in ppFEV1 \nfrom study baseline to the average of week 4 and week 8 was 6.8 percentage points (95% CI: 5.7, 7.8; \nP<0.0001).

There were 23 patients with ppFEV1 <40 at baseline receiving Symkevi and \n24 patients receiving placebo in study 1. The mean treatment difference between Symkevi and \nplacebo-treated patients for absolute change in ppFEV1 through week 24 in this subgroup was \n3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 1.0, 6.1). There were 16 patients with ppFEV1 <40 at baseline \nreceiving Symkevi, 13 receiving ivacaftor and 15 receiving placebo in study 2. The mean treatment \ndifference between Symkevi and placebo-treated patients for absolute change in ppFEV1 through the \naverage of week 4 and week 8 was 4.4 percentage points (95% CI: 1.1, 7.8). The mean treatment \ndifference between ivacaftor and placebo-treated patients was 4.4 percentage points (95% CI: 0.9, \n7.9).  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \nStudy 3 \n \nStudy 3 was a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, rollover, 96-week study to evaluate the safety and \nefficacy of long-term treatment with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor in patients from studies 1 \n(n=462) and 2 (n=227). Efficacy was a secondary objective for study 3 and the efficacy endpoints \nwere not adjusted for multiplicity. \n \nPatients who received placebo in both study 1 and study 2 demonstrated improvements in ppFEV1 \nwhen treated with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor in study 3 [Study 1: within-group \nchange=2.1(95% CI: 0.8, 3.3) percentage points, study 2: within-group change=4.1 (95% CI: 2.2, 6.0)) \npercentage points]. Patients who received Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor in the parent studies \nand continued on treatment,  showed a slight attenuation in ppFEV1 in the extension study, however \nthe overall treatment effect was still positive through 120 weeks and 104 weeks for study 1 and study \n2, respectively.  \n \nSimilar trends were observed for CFQ-R respiratory domain score, pulmonary exacerbation rate and \nBMI. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nAdolescents aged 12 years and older \n \nAdolescents were included together with adults in the trials.   \n \nAdolescent patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene  \n \nThe mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in ppFEV1 was 3.5 (0.6) percentage points in the \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor group and -0.4 (0.6) percentage points in the placebo group in \nstudy 1. Patients who received Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor in study 1 and continued on \ntreatment showed sustained improvements in ppFEV1 through 96 weeks in study 3 [within-group \nchange=1.5 (1.6) percentage points]. Patients who were previously treated with placebo and received \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor in study 3 showed an increase of 0.9 (1.7) percentage points.  \n \nThe mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in BMI z-value was -0.01(0.05) kg/m2 in the Symkevi \nin combination with ivacaftor group and 0.00 (0.05) kg/m2 in the placebo group in study 1. In study 3, \nthe change in BMI z-value in the Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor group was maintained and \npatients previously treated with placebo showed an increase of 0.12 (0.07) kg/m2. \n \nAdolescent patients with CF who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation \nassociated with residual CFTR activity \n \nThe mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in ppFEV1 was 11.7 (1.2) percentage points in the \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor group, 7.6 (1.2) percentage points in the ivacaftor group \nand -0.4 (1.2) percentage points in the placebo group in study 2. Patients who received Symkevi in \ncombination with ivacaftor in study 2 and continued on treatment showed sustained improvements in \nppFEV1 through 96 weeks in study 3 [within-group change=16.9 (4.0) percentage points]. Patients \nwho were previously treated with ivacaftor or placebo and received Symkevi in combination with \nivacaftor in study 3 showed an increase of 4.1 (4.5) percentage points and 6.0 (3.5) percentage points, \nrespectively.   \n \nThe mean absolute change (SE) from baseline in BMI z-value was 0.24 (0.07) kg/m2 in the Symkevi in \ncombination with ivacaftor group, 0.20 (0.07) kg/m2 in the ivacaftor group and 0.04 (0.07) kg/m2 in the \nplacebo group in study 2. In study 3, the change in BMI z-value were maintained in the Symkevi in \ncombination with ivacaftor group (0.29 (0.22) kg/m2, in the ivacaftor group 0.23 (0.27) kg/m2, and in \nthe placebo group 0.23 (0.19) kg/m2.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nPaediatric patients aged 6 to <12 years \n \nStudy 4 \n \nStudy 4 was an 8-week, double-blind, Phase 3 trial in 67 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean \nage 8.6 years) who were randomised 4:1 to either Symkevi or a blinding group. The Symkevi group \nincluded patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation (F/F) (n=42) or heterozygous for \nthe F508del mutation and a second mutation associated with residual CFTR activity (F/RF) (n=12). \nBlinding groups were placebo if homozygous F/F (n=10), or ivacaftor if heterozygous F/RF (n=3).  \nFifty-four patients received either tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg (patients \nweighing < 40 kg at baseline) or tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg (patients \nweighing ≥ 40 kg at baseline), 12 hours apart. Patients receiving tezacaftor/ivacaftor had a screening \nppFEV1 ≥ 70% [mean baseline ppFEV1 of 86.5% (range: 57.9, 124.1%)], baseline LCI2.5 of 9.56 \n(range: 6.95, 15.52), and weight ≥15 kg. Patients with abnormal hepatic or renal function were \nexcluded from the study. Abnormal hepatic impairment was defined as any two or more of ≥ 3 x ULN \nAST, ALT, GGT, ALP; ≥ 2 x ULN total bilirubin; or ≥ 5 x ULN ALT or AST. Abnormal renal \nfunction was defined as GFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the Counahan-Barratt equation. \n \nIn study 4, treatment with Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant \nwithin-group reduction from baseline in LCI2.5 through week 8. Reduction in LCI2.5 was observed at \nweek 2 and was sustained through week 8. See Table 7 for a summary of primary and key secondary \nendpoints. Growth parameters, which were exploratory endpoints, remained stable over 8 weeks of \nSymkevi treatment. \n \n\nTable 7: Effect of Symkevi on efficacy parameters (study 4) \nParameter Baseline \n\nMean (SD) \nN=54 \n\nAbsolute change through \nweek 8* \n\nMean (95% CI) \nN=54 \n\nPrimary endpoint  \n LCI2.5\n\n 9.56 (2.06) -0.51 (-0.74, -0.29) \nP <0.0001 \n\nSecondary and other key endpoints    \nCFQ-R respiratory domain scores (points) 84.6 (11.4) 2.3 (-0.1, 4.6) \nppFEV1 86.5 (12.9) 2.8 (1.0, 4.6) \nSD: standard deviation; CI: confidence interval; CFQ-R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised; \nFEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 second \n* within-group change \n\n \nIn subgroup analyses of F/F and F/RF patients, the within group mean absolute change in LCI2.5 \nwas -0.39 (95% CI: -0.67, -0.10) and -0.92 (95% CI: -1.65, -0.20), respectively. The within group \nmean change in CFQ-R respiratory domain scores in F/F and F/RF patients was 1.4 points (95% \nCI: -1.9, 4.7) and 5.6 points (95% CI: -2.8, 13.9), respectively.  \n \nThe tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 150 mg dose has not been investigated in \nclinical trials in children aged 6 to less than 12 years weighing 30 to < 40 kg. \n \nChildren aged less than 6 years \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSymkevi in combination with ivacaftor in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in cystic \nfibrosis. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult volunteers and \npatients with CF. Following once daily dosing of tezacaftor and twice-daily dosing of ivacaftor in \npatients with CF, plasma concentrations of tezacaftor and ivacaftor reach steady-state within 8 days \nand within 3 to 5 days, respectively, after starting treatment. At steady-state, the accumulation ratio is \napproximately 2.3 for tezacaftor and 3.0 for ivacaftor. Exposures of tezacaftor (administered alone or \nin combination with ivacaftor) increase in an approximately dose-proportional manner with increasing \ndoses from 10 mg to 300 mg once daily. Key pharmacokinetic parameters for tezacaftor and ivacaftor \nat steady-state are shown in Table 8. \n \n\nTable 8: Mean (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of tezacaftor and ivacaftor at steady state in \npatients with CF \n\n Drug Cmax \n(mcg/mL) t½ (h) AUC0-24h or AUC0-12h \n\n(mcg∙h/mL)* \nTezacaftor 100 mg once \ndaily/ivacaftor 150 mg every \n12 hours \n\nTezacaftor 6.52 (1.83) 156 (52.7) 82.7 (23.3) \n\nIvacaftor 1.28 (0.440) 9.3 (1.7) 10.9 (3.89) \n*AUC0-24h for tezacaftor and AUC0-12h for ivacaftor \n\n \nAbsorption \n \nAfter a single dose in healthy subjects in the fed state, tezacaftor was absorbed with a median (range) \ntime to maximum concentration (tmax) of approximately 4 hours (2 to 6 hours). The median (range) tmax \nof ivacaftor was approximately 6 hours (3 to 10 hours) in the fed state. The AUC of tezacaftor did not \nchange when given with fat-containing food relative to fasted conditions. The AUC of ivacaftor when \ngiven in combination with tezacaftor increased approximately 3-fold when given with fat-containing \nfood; therefore, Symkevi and ivacaftor should be administered with fat-containing food. \n \nDistribution \n \nTezacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. Ivacaftor is \napproximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. \nAfter oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg every \n12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (±SD) for apparent volume of distribution of \ntezacaftor and ivacaftor was 271 (157) L and 206 (82.9) L, respectively. Neither tezacaftor nor \nivacaftor partition preferentially into human red blood cells. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nTezacaftor is metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro data suggested that tezacaftor is metabolized \nmainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg \n14C-tezacaftor to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ, and M5-TEZ were the three major \ncirculating metabolites of tezacaftor in humans, contributing to 15%, 31%, and 33% of total \nradioactivity, respectively. Under steady-state, for each of the metabolites, exposure to M1-TEZ, \nM2-TEZ and M5-TEZ is approximately 1.5-fold higher than for tezacaftor. M1-TEZ has similar \npotency to that of tezacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less \npharmacologically active than tezacaftor or M1-TEZ, and M5-TEZ is not considered \npharmacologically active. Another minor circulating metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct \nglucuronidation of tezacaftor. \n \nIvacaftor is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is \nmetabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major metabolites \nof ivacaftor in humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is \nconsidered pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nThe effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure is \nconsistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically \nrelevant. No dose-adjustment of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is considered necessary. No data are available \nfor CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients. \n \nElimination \n \nAfter oral administration of tezacaftor 100 mg once daily in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg every \n12 hours in patients with CF in the fed state, the mean (±SD) for apparent clearance values of \ntezacaftor and ivacaftor were 1.31 (0.41) and 15.7 (6.38) L/h, respectively. After steady-state dosing of \ntezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in CF patients, the mean (SD) terminal half-lives of tezacaftor \nand ivacaftor were approximately 156 (52.7) and 9.3 (1.7) hours, respectively. The mean (SD) \nelimination half-lives for M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were similar to that of the parent \ncompound. The mean (SD) elimination half-lives for M1-IVA and M6-IVA were 11.3 (2.12) h and \n14.4 (6.14) h, respectively. \n \nFollowing oral administration of 14C-tezacaftor, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the \nfaeces (unchanged or as the M2-TEZ metabolite) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as \nM2-TEZ metabolite), resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 21 days after the dose. Less \nthan 1% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as unchanged tezacaftor, showing that renal \nexcretion is not the major pathway of tezacaftor elimination in humans. \n \nFollowing oral administration of ivacaftor alone, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the \nfaeces after metabolic conversion. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged \ndrug. \n \nHepatic impairment \n \nFollowing multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired \nhepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had an approximately 36% increase in AUC and a \n10% increase in Cmax for tezacaftor, and a 50% increase in ivacaftor AUC compared with healthy \nsubjects matched for demographics. Based on these results, a modified regimen of Symkevi is \nrecommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see Table 2 in section 4.2). \n \nThe impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10 to 15) on the \npharmacokinetics of tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in \nexposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be higher than that observed in patients with \nmoderate hepatic impairment. The use of Symkevi in patients with severe hepatic impairment is \ntherefore not recommended unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see Table 2 in section 4.2). \n \nNo dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nTezacaftor alone or in combination with ivacaftor has not been studied in patients with moderate or \nsevere renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease. \nIn a human pharmacokinetic study with tezacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination of tezacaftor \nand its metabolites in urine (only 13.7% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine with 0.79% as \nunchanged medicinal product). \n \nIn a human pharmacokinetic study with ivacaftor alone, there was minimal elimination of ivacaftor \nand its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine). \n \nIn population pharmacokinetic analysis, data from 147 patients on tezacaftor or tezacaftor in \ncombination with ivacaftor in Phase 2/3 clinical studies indicated that mild renal impairment \n\n\n\n20 \n\n(estimated glomerular filtration rate, estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease method, \n60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73 m2) did not affect the clearance of tezacaftor significantly. No dose adjustment \nis recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment. Caution is recommended when \nadministering Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor to patients with severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease. \n \nGender \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. \n \nRace  \n \nVery limited PK data indicate comparable exposure to tezacaftor in white (n=652) and non-white \n(n=8) patients. Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ivacaftor in white (n=379) and \nnon-white (n=29) patients based on a population PK analysis. \n \nElderly \n \nClinical trials of Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor did not include patients over 75 years of age. \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the elderly patients (65 \nto 72 years) are comparable to those in younger adults.  \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of tezacaftor and ivacaftor are presented in Table 9. The \npharmacokinetics of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in children below 6 years of age has not been investigated. \n \n \nTable 9.

Placental transfer of tezacaftor was observed in pregnant rats. \n \nIvacaftor \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nIvacaftor was associated with slight decreases of the seminal vesicle weights, a decrease of overall \nfertility index and number of pregnancies in females mated with treated males and significant \nreductions in number of corpora lutea and implantation sites with subsequent reductions in the average \nlitter size and average number of viable embryos per litter in treated females. The No Observed \nAdverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings provides an exposure level of approximately \n5 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when administered as \ntezacaftor/ivacaftor in adult humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). \n \nIn the pre- and post-natal study ivacaftor decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a \nreduction in pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an \nexposure level of approximately 4 times the systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites when \nadministered as tezacaftor/ivacaftor in adult humans at the MRHD. Placental transfer of ivacaftor was \nobserved in pregnant rats and rabbits. \n \nFindings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 at ivacaftor \nexposure levels of 0.25 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites \nwhen administered as tezacaftor/ivacaftor. This finding has not been observed in fetuses derived from \nrat dams treated with ivacaftor on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to ivacaftor through milk \ningestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week-old rats, nor in 3.5- to 5-month-old dogs treated with \nivacaftor. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown. \n \nTezacaftor/ivacaftor  \n \nCombination repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs involving the co-administration of tezacaftor \nand ivacaftor to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity did not produce any \nunexpected toxicities or interactions. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nSymkevi 50 mg/75 mg film-coated tablets \nSymkevi 100 mg/150 mg film-coated tablets \n\ntezacaftor/ivacaftor \n \n \n\n This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side effects. \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Symkevi is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Symkevi \n3. How to take Symkevi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Symkevi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Symkevi is and what it is used for \n \nSymkevi contains two active substances, tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The medicine helps lung cells to \nwork better in some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited condition in which the lungs \nand the digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.  \n \nSymkevi works on a protein called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), \nwhich is damaged in some people with CF (who have a mutation in the CFTR gene). Ivacaftor causes \nthe protein to work better while tezacaftor increases the amount of protein at the cell surface. Symkevi \nis normally taken with ivacaftor, another medicine. \n \nSymkevi taken with ivacaftor is for long-term treatment of patients aged 6 and over who have CF with \ncertain genetic mutations that result in reduced amount and/or function of the CFTR protein. \n \nSymkevi taken with ivacaftor helps your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also \nnotice that you do not get ill as often and/or that it is easier to gain weight. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Symkevi \n \nDo not take Symkevi \n \n• If you are allergic to tezacaftor, ivacaftor, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \nTalk to your doctor, without taking the tablets, if this applies to you. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \n• Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems, or have had them previously. Your doctor \n\nmay need to adjust your dose. \n \n• Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment with \n\nSymkevi, especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. Increased liver \nenzymes in the blood have been seen in patients with CF receiving Symkevi. \n\nTell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems. These are listed in \nsection 4. \n \n• Your doctor may do eye examinations before and during treatment with Symkevi. Cloudiness \n\nof the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has occurred in some children and \nadolescents receiving this treatment. \n\n \n• Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems, or you have previously had them. \n \n• Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you have received an organ transplant. \n \nChildren under 6 \n \nSymkevi is not to be used in children under the age of 6 years. It is not known if Symkevi is safe and \neffective in children under 6. \n \nOther medicines and Symkevi \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. Some medicines can affect how Symkevi works or may make side effects more likely. In \nparticular, tell your doctor if you take any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may change the \ndose of one of the medicines if you take any of these. \n• Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections). These include \n\nketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and fluconazole. \n• Antibiotic medicines (used for the treatment of bacterial infections). These include \n\ntelithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, rifampicin and rifabutin. \n• Anticonvulsant medicines (used for the treatment of epilepsy and epileptic seizures or fits). \n\nThese include phenobarbital, carbamazepine and phenytoin. \n• Herbal medicines. These include St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). \n• Immunosuppressants (used after an organ transplantation). These include ciclosporin, \n\ntacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus. \n• Cardiac glycosides (used for the treatment of some heart conditions). These include digoxin. \n• Anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent blood clots). These include warfarin. \n• Medicines for diabetes. These include glimepiride and glipizide. \n \nSymkevi with food and drink \n \nAvoid food or drinks containing grapefruit during treatment as these may increase the side effects of \nSymkevi by increasing the amount of Symkevi in your body. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n• Pregnancy: It may be better to avoid using this medicine during pregnancy. Your doctor will \nhelp you decide what is best for you and your child. \n\n• Breast-feeding: It is not known if tezacaftor or ivacaftor pass into breast milk. Your doctor will \nconsider the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of treatment for you to help \nyou decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop treatment. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nSymkevi can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle or use machines unless you are not \naffected. \n \nSymkevi contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3.
