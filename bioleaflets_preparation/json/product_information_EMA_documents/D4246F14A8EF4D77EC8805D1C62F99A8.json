This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe.\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe\n\nEach pre-filled syringe contains 100 mg of guselkumab in 1 mL solution.\n\nTremfya 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen\n\nEach pre-filled pen contains 100 mg of guselkumab in 1 mL solution.\n\nGuselkumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lamda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the\ninterleukin (IL)-23 protein, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA \ntechnology.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection (injection)\n\nThe solution is clear and colourless to light yellow.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nPlaque psoriasis\n\nTremfya is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\n\nTremfya, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of active \npsoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to \na prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy (see section 5.1).\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTremfya is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which Tremfya is indicated.\n\n\n\n3\n\nPosology\n\nPlaque psoriasis\nThe recommended dose of Tremfya is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed \nby a maintenance dose every 8 weeks.\n\nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 16 weeks of treatment.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\nThe recommended dose of Tremfya is 100 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0 and 4, followed \nby a maintenance dose every 8 weeks. For patients at high risk for joint damage according to clinical\njudgement, a dose of 100 mg every 4 weeks may be considered (see section 5.1).\n\nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response \nafter 24 weeks of treatment.\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nElderly (≥ 65 years)\nNo dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).\nThere is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years and very limited information in subjects aged \n≥ 75 years (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal or hepatic impairment\nTremfya has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be made.\nFor further information on elimination of guselkumab, see section 5.2.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Tremfya in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not\nbeen established. No data are available.\nMethod of administration\nSubcutaneous use. If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection \nsites.\n\nAfter proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may inject Tremfya if a physician \ndetermines that this is appropriate. However, the physician should ensure appropriate medical \nfollow-up of patients. Patients should be instructed to inject the full amount of Tremfya according to \nthe ‘Instructions for use’ provided in the carton.\nFor further instructions on preparation and special precautions for handling, see section 6.6 and the \n‘Instructions for use’ leaflet.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nSerious hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nClinically important active infections (e.g., active tuberculosis, see section 4.4).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nTraceability\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded.\n\nInfections\nTremfya may increase the risk of infection. Treatment with Tremfya should not be initiated in patients\nwith any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.\n\n\n\n4\n\nPatients treated with Tremfya should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of \nclinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or \nserious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, the patient should be monitored closely and\nTremfya should be discontinued until the infection resolves.\n\nPre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis\nPrior to initiating treatment with Tremfya, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection.\nPatients receiving Tremfya should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after \ntreatment. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiating Tremfya in patients with a past \nhistory of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.\n\nHypersensitivity\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in the post-marketing \nsetting. Some serious hypersensitivity reactions occurred several days after treatment with \nguselkumab, including cases with urticaria and dyspnoea. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, \nadministration of Tremfya should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.\n\nHepatic Transaminase Elevations\nIn psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations was observed in \npatients treated with Tremfya q4w compared to patients treated with Tremfya q8w or placebo (see \nsection 4.8, Table 2).\n\nWhen prescribing Tremfya q4w in psoriatic arthritis, it is recommended to evaluate liver enzymes at \nbaseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. If increases in ALT or AST are \nobserved and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, Tremfya should be temporarily interrupted until \nthis diagnosis is excluded.\n\nImmunisations\nPrior to initiating therapy with Tremfya, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be \nconsidered according to current immunisation guidelines. Live vaccines should not be used \nconcurrently in patients treated with Tremfya. No data are available on the response to live or inactive \nvaccines.\n\nBefore live viral or live bacterial vaccination, treatment with Tremfya should be withheld for at least\n12 weeks after the last dose and can be resumed at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Prescribers should \nconsult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the specific vaccine for additional information and \nguidance on concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents post-vaccination.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteractions with CYP450 substrates\nIn a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, changes in systemic exposures \n(Cmax and AUCinf) of midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and caffeine after a \nsingle dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant, indicating that drug interactions between \nguselkumab and substrates of various CYP enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and \nCYP1A2) are unlikely. There is no need for dose adjustment when co-administering guselkumab and \nCYP450 substrates.\n\nConcomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy\nIn psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of Tremfya in combination with immunosuppressants, \nincluding biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and \nfor at least 12 weeks after treatment.\n\nPregnancy\nThere are no data from the use of guselkumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition \nor postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the \nuse of Tremfya in pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is unknown whether guselkumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted \nin breast milk during the first few days after birth, and decrease to low concentrations soon afterwards; \nconsequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant during this period cannot be excluded. A decision should \nbe made whether to discontinue, or abstain from initiating treatment with Tremfya, taking into account \nthe benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Tremfya therapy to the woman. See\nsection 5.3 for information on the excretion of guselkumab in animal (cynomolgus monkey) milk.\n\nFertility\nThe effect of guselkumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate \ndirect or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nTremfya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nThe most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) was upper respiratory infection.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nTable 1 provides a list of adverse reactions from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical studies as well \nas from post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions are classified by MedDRA System Organ \nClass and frequency, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to \n< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n\nTable 1: List of adverse reactions\nSystem Organ Class Frequency ADR\nInfections and infestations Very common Respiratory tract infections\n\nUncommon Herpes simplex infections\nUncommon Tinea infections\nUncommon Gastroenteritis\n\nInvestigations Common Transaminases increased\nUncommon Neutrophil count decreased\n\nImmune system disorders Uncommon Hypersensitivity\nUncommon Anaphylaxis\n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\nGastrointestinal disorders Common Diarrhoea\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders\n\nUncommon Urticaria\nUncommon Rash\n\n\n\n6\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders\n\nCommon Arthralgia\n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions\n\nCommon Injection site reactions\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nTransaminases Increased\nIn two phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, through the placebo-controlled period, increased \ntransaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) were reported\nmore frequently as adverse events in the Tremfya-treated groups (8.6% in the q4w group and 8.3% in \nthe q8w group) than in the placebo group (4.6%).\n\nBased on laboratory assessments, most transaminase increases were ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal \n(ULN). Transaminase increases from > 3 to ≤ 5 x ULN and > 5 x ULN were low in frequency, \noccurring more often in the Tremfya q4w group compared with the Tremfya q8w group (Table 2).\nThrough 1 year, in most cases, the increase in transaminases was transient and did not lead to \ndiscontinuation of treatment.\n\nTable 2: Frequency of patients with transaminase increases post-baseline in two Phase III psoriatic \narthritis clinical studies\n\nThrough Week 24a Through 1 Yearb\n\nPlacebo\nN=370\n\nTremfya\n100 mg q8w\n\nN=373\n\nTremfya\n100 mg q4w\n\nN=371\n\nTremfya\n100 mg q8w\n\nN=373\n\nTremfya\n100 mg q4w\n\nN=371\nALT\n>1 to ≤3 x ULN 30.0% 28.2% 35.0% 33.5% 41.2%\n>3 to ≤ 5 x ULN 1.4% 1.1% 2.7% 1.6% 4.6%\n>5 x ULN 0.8% 0.8% 1.1% 1.1% 1.1%\nAST\n>1 to ≤3 x ULN 20.0% 18.8% 21.6% 22.8% 27.8%\n>3 to ≤ 5 x ULN 0.5% 1.6% 1.6% 2.9% 3.8%\n>5 x ULN 1.1% 0.5% 1.6% 0.5% 1.6%\na placebo-controlled period\nb patients randomized to Tremfya at baseline\n\nNeutrophil count decreased\nIn two phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies, through the placebo-controlled period, decreased \nneutrophil count was reported more frequently as an adverse event in the Tremfya-treated group\n(0.9%) than in the placebo group (0%). In most cases, the decrease in blood neutrophil count was \nmild, transient, not associated with infection and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment.\n\nGastroenteritis\nIn two phase III psoriasis clinical studies through the placebo-controlled period, gastroenteritis \noccurred more frequently in the Tremfya-treated group (1.1%) than in the placebo group (0.7%). \nThrough Week 156, 4.9% of all Tremfya-treated patients reported gastroenteritis. Adverse reactions of\ngastroenteritis were non-serious and did not lead to discontinuation of Tremfya through Week 156.\nGastroenteritis rates observed in psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through the placebo-controlled \nperiod were similar to those observed in the psoriasis clinical studies.\n\nInjection site reactions\nIn two phase III psoriasis clinical studies through Week 48, 0.7% of Tremfya injections and 0.3% of \nplacebo injections were associated with injection site reactions. Through Week 156, 0.5% of Tremfya\ninjections were associated with injection site reactions. Adverse reactions of injection site erythema \nand injection site pain were the most commonly reported events of injection site reaction and were \ngenerally mild to moderate in severity; none were serious, and none led to discontinuation of Tremfya.\n\n\n\n7\n\nIn two phase III psoriatic arthritis clinical studies through Week 24, the number of subjects that \nreported 1 or more injection site reactions was low and slightly higher in the Tremfya groups than in \nthe placebo group; 5 (1.3%) subjects in the Tremfya q8w group, 4 (1.1%) subjects in the Tremfya q4w\ngroup, and 1 (0.3%) subject in the placebo group. One subject discontinued Tremfya due to an \ninjection site reaction during the placebo-controlled period of the psoriatic arthritis clinical studies.\nOverall, the rate of injections associated with injection site reactions observed in psoriatic arthritis\nclinical studies through the placebo-controlled period similar to rates observed in the psoriasis clinical \nstudies.\n\nImmunogenicity\nThe immunogenicity of Tremfya was evaluated using a sensitive and drug-tolerant immunoassay.\n\nPlaque psoriasis\nIn pooled phase II and phase III analyses in patients with psoriasis, fewer than 6% of patients treated \nwith Tremfya developed antidrug antibodies in up to 52 weeks of treatment. Of the patients who \ndeveloped antidrug antibodies, approximately 7% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing,\nwhich equates to 0.4% of all patients treated with Tremfya. In pooled phase III analyses,\napproximately 9% of patients treated with Tremfya developed antidrug antibodies in up to 156 weeks \nof treatment. Antidrug antibodies were not associated with lower efficacy or development of \ninjection-site reactions.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\nIn pooled phase III analyses in patients with psoriatic arthritis, 2% (n=15) of patients treated with \nTremfya developed antidrug antibodies in up to 24 weeks of treatment. Of these patients, 1 patient had \nantibodies that were classified as neutralizing. None of these patients developed injection site \nreactions. Overall, the small number of patients with antidrug antibodies limits definitive conclusion\nof the effect of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety of guselkumab in patients \nwith psoriatic arthritis.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSingle intravenous doses of guselkumab up to 987 mg (10 mg/kg) have been administered in healthy \nvolunteers and single subcutaneous doses of guselkumab up to 300 mg have been administered in \npatients with plaque psoriasis in clinical studies without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of \noverdosage, monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and administer \nappropriate symptomatic treatment immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC16.\n\nMechanism of action\nGuselkumab is a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds selectively to the interleukin 23 \n(IL-23) protein with high specificity and affinity. IL-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the \ndifferentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, (e.g., Th17 cells and Tc17 cells) and innate \nimmune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and \nIL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. In humans, selective blockade of IL-23 was shown to \nnormalize production of these cytokines.\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8\n\nLevels of IL-23 are elevated in the skin of patients with plaque psoriasis. In in vitro models, \nguselkumab was shown to inhibit the bioactivity of IL-23 by blocking its interaction with cell surface \nIL-23 receptor, disrupting IL-23-mediated signaling, activation and cytokine cascades. Guselkumab\nexerts clinical effects in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis through blockade of the IL-23 cytokine \npathway.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects\nIn a phase I study, treatment with guselkumab resulted in reduced expression of IL-23/Th17 pathway \ngenes and psoriasis-associated gene expression profiles, as shown by analyses of mRNA obtained \nfrom lesional skin biopsies of patients with plaque psoriasis at Week 12 compared to baseline. In the \nsame phase I study, treatment with guselkumab resulted in improvement of histological measures of \npsoriasis at Week 12, including reductions in epidermal thickness and T-cell density. In addition, \nreduced serum IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 levels compared to placebo were observed in guselkumab\ntreated patients in phase II and phase III plaque psoriasis studies. These results are consistent with the \nclinical benefit observed with guselkumab treatment in plaque psoriasis.\n\nIn psoriatic arthritis patients in phase III studies, serum levels of acute phase proteins C-reactive \nprotein, serum amyloid A, and IL-6, and Th17 effector cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were \nelevated at baseline. Guselkumab decreased the levels of these proteins within 4 weeks of initiation of \ntreatment. Guselkumab further reduced the levels of these proteins by Week 24 compared to baseline \nand also to placebo. \n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nPlaque psoriasis\nThe efficacy and safety of guselkumab was assessed in three randomised, double-blind, active \ncontrolled phase III studies in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who were \ncandidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.\n\nVOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2\nTwo studies (VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab versus \nplacebo and adalimumab in 1829 adult patients. Patients randomised to guselkumab (N=825) received \n100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter through Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) and \nWeek 20 (VOYAGE 2). Patients randomised to adalimumab (N=582) received 80 mg at Week 0 and \n40 mg at Week 1, followed by 40 mg every other week (q2w) through Week 48 (VOYAGE 1) and \nWeek 23 (VOYAGE 2). In both studies, patients randomised to placebo (N=422) received guselkumab \n100 mg at Weeks 16, 20 and q8w thereafter. In VOYAGE 1, all patients, including those randomised \nto adalimumab at Week 0, started to receive open-label guselkumab q8w at Week 52. In VOYAGE 2, \npatients randomised to guselkumab at Week 0 who were Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 \nresponders at Week 28 were re-randomised to either continue treatment with guselkumab q8w \n(maintenance treatment) or receive placebo (withdrawal treatment). Withdrawal patients re-initiated \nguselkumab (dosed at time of retreatment, 4 weeks later and q8w thereafter) when they experienced at \nleast a 50% loss of their Week 28 PASI improvement. Patients randomised to adalimumab at Week 0 \nwho were PASI 90 non-responders received guselkumab at Weeks 28, 32 and q8w thereafter. In \nVOYAGE 2, all patients started to receive open-label guselkumab q8w at Week 76.\n\nBaseline disease characteristics were consistent for the study populations in VOYAGE 1 and 2 with a \nmedian body surface area (BSA) of 22% and 24%, a median baseline PASI score of 19 for both \nstudies, a median baseline dermatology quality of life index (DLQI) score of 14 and 14.5, a baseline \ninvestigator global assessment (IGA) score of severe for 25% and 23% of patients, and a history of \npsoriatic arthritis for 19% and 18% of patients, respectively.\n\nOf all patients included in VOYAGE 1 and 2, 32% and 29% were naïve to both conventional systemic \nand biologic therapy, 54% and 57% had received prior phototherapy, and 62% and 64% had received \nprior conventional systemic therapy, respectively. In both studies, 21% had received prior biologic \n\n\n\n9\n\ntherapy, including 11% who had received at least one anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agent, \nand approximately 10% who had received an anti-IL-12/IL-23 agent.\n\nThe efficacy of guselkumab was evaluated with respect to overall skin disease, regional disease (scalp, \nhand and foot and nails) and quality of life and patient reported outcomes. The co-primary endpoints \nin VOYAGE 1 and 2 were the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of cleared or \nminimal (IGA 0/1) and a PASI 90 response at Week 16 versus placebo (see Table 3).\n\nOverall skin disease\nTreatment with guselkumab resulted in significant improvements in the measures of disease activity \ncompared to placebo and adalimumab at Week 16 and compared to adalimumab at Weeks 24 and 48. \nThe key efficacy results for the primary and major secondary study endpoints are shown in Table 3\nbelow.\n\nTable 3: Summary of Clinical Responses in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2\nNumber of patients (%)\n\nVOYAGE 1 VOYAGE 2\nPlacebo\n(N=174)\n\nGuselkumab\n(N=329)\n\nAdalimumab\n(N=334)\n\nPlacebo\n(N=248)\n\nGuselkumab\n(N=496)\n\nAdalimumab\n(N=248)\n\nWeek 16\nPASI 75 10 (5.7) 300 (91.2)a 244 (73.1)b 20 (8.1) 428 (86.3)a 170 (68.5)b\n\nPASI 90 5 (2.9) 241 (73.3)c 166 (49.7)b 6 (2.4) 347 (70.0)c 116 (46.8)b\n\nPASI 100 1 (0.6) 123 (37.4)a 57 (17.1)d 2 (0.8) 169 (34.1)a 51 (20.6)d\n\nIGA 0/1 12 (6.9) 280 (85.1)c 220 (65.9)b 21 (8.5) 417 (84.1)c 168 (67.7)b\n\nIGA 0 2 (1.1) 157 (47.7)a 88 (26.3)d 2 (0.8) 215 (43.3)a 71 (28.6)d\n\nWeek 24\nPASI 75 - 300 (91.2) 241 (72.2)e - 442 (89.1) 176 (71.0)e\n\nPASI 90 - 264 (80.2) 177 (53.0)b - 373 (75.2) 136 (54.8)b\n\nPASI 100 - 146 (44.4) 83 (24.9)e - 219 (44.2) 66 (26.6)e\n\nIGA 0/1 - 277 (84.2) 206 (61.7)b - 414 (83.5) 161 (64.9)b\n\nIGA 0 - 173 (52.6) 98 (29.3)b - 257 (51.8) 78 (31.5)b\n\nWeek 48\nPASI 75 - 289 (87.8) 209 (62.6)e - - -\nPASI 90 - 251 (76.3) 160 (47.9)b - - -\nPASI 100 - 156 (47.4) 78 (23.4)e - - -\nIGA 0/1 - 265 (80.5) 185 (55.4)b - - -\nIGA 0 - 166 (50.5) 86 (25.7)b - - -\n\na p < 0.001 for comparison between guselkumab and placebo.\nb p < 0.001 for comparison between guselkumab and adalimumab for major secondary endpoints.\nc p < 0.001 for the comparisons between guselkumab and placebo for the co-primary endpoints.\nd comparisons between guselkumab and adalimumab were not performed.\ne p < 0.001 for comparison between guselkumab and adalimumab.\n\nResponse over time\nGuselkumab demonstrated rapid onset of efficacy, with a significantly higher percent improvement in \nPASI as compared with placebo as early as Week 2 (p < 0.001).

Guselkumab was efficacious in conventional systemic-naive, biologic-naive, and \nbiologic-exposed patients.\n\n\n\n11\n\nIn VOYAGE 2, 88.6% of patients receiving guselkumab maintenance treatment at Week 48 were \nPASI 90 responders compared to 36.8% of patients who were withdrawn from treatment at Week 28 \n(p < 0.001). Loss of PASI 90 response was noted as early as 4 weeks after withdrawal of guselkumab \ntreatment with a median time to loss of PASI 90 response of approximately 15 weeks. Among patients \nwho were withdrawn from treatment and subsequently re-initiated guselkumab, 80% regained a \nPASI 90 response when assessed 20 weeks after initiation of retreatment.\n\nIn VOYAGE 2, among 112 patients randomised to adalimumab who failed to achieve a PASI 90 \nresponse at Week 28, 66% and 76% achieved a PASI 90 response after 20 and 44 weeks of treatment \nwith guselkumab, respectively.

All patients (N=871) received open-label ustekinumab (45 mg ≤100 kg and\n90 mg >100 kg) at Weeks 0 and 4. At Week 16, 268 patients with an IGA ≥ 2 score were randomised\nto either continue ustekinumab treatment (N=133) q12w, or to initiate guselkumab treatment (N=135) \nat Weeks 16, 20, and q8w thereafter. Baseline characteristics for randomised patients were similar to \nthose observed in VOYAGE 1 and 2.\n\nAfter randomisation, the primary endpoint was the number of post-randomisation visits between \nWeeks 12 and 24 at which patients achieved an IGA score 0/1 and had ≥ 2 grade improvement.\nPatients were examined at four week intervals for a total of four visits. Among patients who\ninadequately responded to ustekinumab at the time of randomisation, significantly greater\nimprovement of efficacy was observed in patients who switched to guselkumab treatment compared to \npatients who continued ustekinumab treatment. Between 12 and 24 weeks after randomisation,\nguselkumab patients achieved an IGA score 0/1 with ≥ 2 grade improvement twice as often as \nustekinumab patients (mean 1.5 vs 0.7 visits, respectively, p < 0.001). Additionally, at 12 weeks after \nrandomisation a higher proportion of guselkumab patients compared to ustekinumab patients achieved \n\n\n\n13\n\nan IGA score 0/1 and ≥ 2 grade improvement (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively; p = 0.001) and a \nPASI 90 response (48% vs 23%, respectively, p < 0.001). Differences in response rates between \nguselkumab and ustekinumab treated patients were noted as early as 4 weeks after randomisation \n(11.1% and 9.0%, respectively) and reached a maximum 24 weeks after randomisation (see Figure 3).\nNo new safety findings were observed in patients who switched from ustekinumab to guselkumab.\n\nFigure 3: Percent of Subjects Who Achieved an IGA Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) and \nat least a 2-grade improvement in IGA from Week 0 Through Week 24 by Visit \nAfter Randomisation in NAVIGATE\n\nP\ne\n\nrc\ne\n\nn\nt \n\no\nf \n\nS\nu\n\nb\nje\n\nc\nts\n\n (\n%\n\n)\n\nWeek After Randomisation\n\nGuselkumab (n=135) Ustekinumab (n=133)\n\n11\n69\n\n_v\n5\n\nECLIPSE\nEfficacy and safety of guselkumab were also investigated in a double-blind study compared to\nsecukinumab.

Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA based on \nthe Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR]) for a median duration of 4 years. Patients \nwith different subtypes of PsA were enrolled in both studies, including polyarticular arthritis with the \nabsence of rheumatoid nodules (40%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (30%), asymmetric \nperipheral arthritis (23%), distal interphalangeal involvement (7%) and arthritis mutilans (1%). Over \n65% and 42% of the patients had enthesitis and dactylitis at baseline, respectively, and over 75% of \npatients had ≥ 3% BSA psoriasis skin involvement. DISCOVER 1 and DISCOVER 2 evaluated 381 \nand 739 patients, respectively, who received treatment with guselkumab 100 mg administered at \nWeeks 0 and 4 followed by every 8 weeks (q8w) or guselkumab 100 mg q4w, or placebo. \nApproximately 58% of patients in both studies continued on stable doses of MTX (≤ 25 mg/week).\n\nIn both studies over 90% of patients had prior csDMARD use.

Additionally, examination of age, gender, race, body weight, \nand previous csDMARD use (DISCOVER 1 and 2) and previous anti-TNFα use (DISCOVER 1), did \nnot identify differences in response to guselkumab among these subgroups.\n\nIn DISCOVER 1 and 2, improvements were shown in all components of the ACR scores including \npatient assessment of pain. At Week 24 in both studies, the proportion of patients achieving a modified \nPsA response criteria (PsARC) response was greater in the guselkumab groups compared to placebo. \n\nDactylitis and enthesitis were assessed based on pooled data from DISCOVER 1 and 2. At Week 24, \namong patients with dactylitis at baseline, the proportion of subjects with dactylitis resolution was \ngreater in the guselkumab q8w group (59.4%, nominal p < 0.001) and q4w group (63.5%, p = 0.006) \ncompared to placebo (42.2%). At Week 24, among patients with enthesitis at baseline, the proportion \nof subjects with enthesitis resolution was greater in the guselkumab q8w group (49.6%, nominal \np < 0.001) and q4w group (44.9%, p = 0.006) compared to placebo (29.4%).\n\nIn DISCOVER 1 and 2, patients treated with guselkumab who had spondylitis with peripheral arthritis \nas their primary presentation, demonstrated greater improvement from baseline in Bath Ankylosing \nSpondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) compared to placebo at Week 24. \n\nRadiographic response\nIn DISCOVER 2, inhibition of structural damage progression was measured radiographically and \nexpressed as the mean change from baseline in the total modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score. \nAt Week 24, the guselkumab q4w group demonstrated statistically significantly less radiographic \nprogression and the guselkumab q8w group showed numerically less progression than placebo \n(Table 9). The observed benefit with the guselkumab q4w dosing regimen on inhibition of \nradiographic progression (ie, smaller mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score in the \nq4w group versus placebo) was most pronounced in subjects with both a high C-reactive protein value \nand high number of joints with erosions at baseline.\n\n\n\n17\n\nTable 9:Change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at Week 24 in DISCOVER 2\nN LSMean changec (95% CId) from baseline in modified vdH-S score at \n\nWeek 24\nPlacebo 246 0.95 (0.61, 1.29)\nGuselkumab 100 mg q8w 248 0.52 a (0.18, 0.86)\nGuselkumab 100 mg q4w 245 0.29 b (-0.05, 0.63)\na not statistically significant p = 0.068 (major secondary endpoint)\nb p = 0.006 (major secondary endpoint)\nc LSmean change = least squares mean change\nd CI = confidence interval\n\nAt Week 52, the mean change from baseline in total modified vdH-S was similar in the guselkumab \nq8w and q4w groups (Table 10).\n\nTable 10: Change from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at Week 52 in DISCOVER 2\nN Mean changea (SDb) from baseline in total modified vdH-S score at \n\nWeek 52\nGuselkumab 100 mg q8w 235 0.97 (3.623)\nGuselkumab 100 mg q4w 229 1.07 (3.843)\na Based on observed data at Week 52\nb SD = standard deviation\nNote: no placebo group beyond Week 24\n\nPhysical function and health-related quality of life\nIn DISCOVER 1 and 2, guselkumab treated patients showed significant improvement (p < 0.001) in \nphysical function compared to placebo as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability \nIndex (HAQ-DI) at Week 24. \n\nA significantly greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score \nwas observed in guselkumab treated patients compared to placebo at Week 24 in DISCOVER 1 \n(p < 0.001 for both dose groups) and DISCOVER 2 (p = 0.006 for q4w group). At Week 24, a greater \nincrease from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score\nwas observed in guselkumab treated patients compared to placebo in both studies. In DISCOVER 2, \ngreater improvements in health-related quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality\nIndex (DLQI) were observed in guselkumab treated patients compared to placebo at Week 24.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTremfya in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in one or more subsets of the paediatric population \n(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nFollowing a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects, guselkumab reached a mean \n(± SD) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 8.09 ± 3.68 mcg/mL by approximately 5.5 days post \ndose.\n\nSteady-state serum guselkumab concentrations were achieved by Week 20 following subcutaneous \nadministrations of 100 mg guselkumab at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. The mean \n(± SD) steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations in two phase III studies in patients with \nplaque psoriasis were 1.15 ± 0.73 mcg/mL and 1.23 ± 0.84 mcg/mL.\nThe pharmacokinetics of guselkumab in subjects with psoriatic arthritis was similar to that in subjects \nwith psoriasis. Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of Tremfya at Weeks 0, 4, and every\n8 weeks thereafter, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was also approximately \n1.2 mcg/mL. Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of Tremfya every 4 weeks, mean \nsteady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 3.8 mcg/mL.\n\n\n\n18\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of guselkumab following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection was \nestimated to be approximately 49% in healthy subjects.\n\nDistribution\nMean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following a single intravenous \nadministration to healthy subjects ranged from approximately 7 to 10 L across studies.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe exact pathway through which guselkumab is metabolized has not been characterized. As a human \nIgG mAb, guselkumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic\npathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.\n\nElimination\nMean systemic clearance (CL) following a single intravenous administration to healthy subjects\nranged from 0.288 to 0.479 L/day across studies. Mean half-life (T1/2) of guselkumab was \napproximately 17 days in healthy subjects and approximately 15 to 18 days in patients with plaque \npsoriasis across studies.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that concomitant use of NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids \nand csDMARDs such as methotrexate, did not affect the clearance of guselkumab.\n\nLinearity/non-linearity\nThe systemic exposure of guselkumab (Cmax and AUC) increased in an approximately \ndose-proportional manner following a single subcutaneous injection at doses ranging from 10 mg to \n300 mg in healthy subjects or patients with plaque psoriasis.\n\nElderly patients\nNo specific studies have been conducted in elderly patients. Of the 1384 plaque psoriasis patients \nexposed to guselkumab in phase III clinical studies and included in the population pharmacokinetic \nanalysis, 70 patients were 65 years of age or older, including 4 patients who were 75 years of age or\nolder. Of the 746 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to guselkumab in phase III clinical studies, a total \nof 38 patients were 65 years of age or older, and no patients were 75 years of age or older.\n\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients indicated no \napparent changes in CL/F estimate in patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to patients < 65 years of \nage, suggesting no dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients.\n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment\nNo specific study has been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the \npharmacokinetics of guselkumab. Renal elimination of intact guselkumab, an IgG mAb, is expected to\nbe low and of minor importance; similarly, hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance \nof guselkumab as IgG mAbs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety\npharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and pre- and post-natal development.\n\nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, guselkumab was well tolerated via\nintravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration. A weekly subcutaneous dose of 50 mg/kg to \nmonkeys resulted in exposure (AUC) and Cmax values that were at least 49-fold and >200-fold higher, \nrespectively, than those measured in the human clinical PK study. Additionally, there were no adverse \nimmunotoxicity or cardiovascular safety pharmacology effects noted during the conduct of the \nrepeat-dose toxicity studies or in a targeted cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus \nmonkeys.\n\nThere were no preneoplastic changes observed in histopathology evaluations of animals treated up to \n\n\n\n19\n\n24-weeks, or following the 12-week recovery period during which drug was detectable in the serum.\n\nNo mutagenicity or carcinogenicity studies were conducted with guselkumab.\n\nGuselkumab could not be detected in breast milk from cynomolgus monkeys as measured at post-natal\nday 28.\n\n6.

See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.\n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you.\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you use Tremfya\n3. How to use Tremfya\n4. Possible side effects\n5. How to store Tremfya\n6. Contents of the pack and other information\n\n1. What Tremfya is and what it is used for\n\nTremfya contains the active substance guselkumab which is a type of protein called a monoclonal \nantibody.\n\nThis medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, which is present at increased \nlevels in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nPlaque psoriasis\nTremfya is used to treat adults with moderate to severe “plaque psoriasis”, an inflammatory condition \naffecting the skin and nails.\n\nTremfya can improve the condition of the skin and appearance of nails and reduce symptoms, such as \nscaling, shedding, flaking, itching, pain and burning.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\nTremfya is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”, an inflammatory disease of the joints, \noften accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Tremfya to reduce the signs \nand symptoms of the disease. Tremfya can be used alone or with another medicine named \nmethotrexate.\n\nUsing Tremfya in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to\ndo normal daily activities.\n\n\n\n41\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Tremfya\n\nDo not use Tremfya\n if you are allergic to guselkumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).

You should not be given certain types of \n\nvaccines (live vaccines) while using Tremfya.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n Tremfya should not be used in pregnancy as the effects of this medicine in pregnant women are \n\nnot known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming \npregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Tremfya and for at least 12 weeks\nafter the last Tremfya dose.

What Tremfya is and what it is used for\n\nTremfya contains the active substance guselkumab which is a type of protein called a monoclonal \nantibody.\n\nThis medicine works by blocking the activity of a protein called IL-23, which is present at increased \nlevels in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nPlaque Psoriasis\nTremfya is used to treat adults with moderate to severe “plaque psoriasis”, an inflammatory condition \naffecting the skin and nails.\n\nTremfya can improve the condition of the skin and appearance of nails and reduce symptoms, such as \nscaling, shedding, flaking, itching, pain and burning.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis\nTremfya is used to treat a condition called “psoriatic arthritis”, an inflammatory disease of the joints, \noften accompanied by psoriasis. If you have psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines. \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given Tremfya to reduce the signs \nand symptoms of the disease. Tremfya can be used alone or with another medicine named \nmethotrexate.\n\nUsing Tremfya in psoriatic arthritis will benefit you by reducing the signs and symptoms of the \ndisease, slowing down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints and improving your ability to \ndo normal daily activities.\n\n\n\n56\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Tremfya\n\nDo not use Tremfya\n if you are allergic to guselkumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).

Increases in liver enzymes may occur \nmore frequently in patients receiving Tremfya every 4 weeks than in patients receiving Tremfya every \n8 weeks (see “How to use Tremfya” in section 3).\n\nLook out for infections and allergic reactions\nTremfya can potentially cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions and infections.

You should not be given certain types of \n\nvaccines (live vaccines) while using Tremfya.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n Tremfya should not be used in pregnancy as the effects of this medicine in pregnant women are \n\nnot known. If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you are advised to avoid becoming \npregnant and must use adequate contraception while using Tremfya and for at least 12 weeks\n\n\n\n57\n\nafter the last Tremfya dose.
