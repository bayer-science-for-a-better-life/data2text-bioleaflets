This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nCINQAERO 10 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach mL of concentrate contains 10 mg of reslizumab (10 mg/mL). \n \nEach vial of 2.5 mL contains 25 mg of reslizumab. \nEach vial of 10 mL contains 100 mg of reslizumab. \n \nReslizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody produced in mouse myeloma cells (NS0) by \nrecombinant DNA technology. \n \nExcipient with known effect \nEach vial of 2.5 mL contains 0.05 mmol (1.15 mg) of sodium. \nEach vial of 10 mL contains 0.20 mmol (4.6 mg) of sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n \nClear to slightly hazy opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow solution with pH 5.5. Proteinaceous \nparticles might be present. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCINQAERO is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma \ninadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for \nmaintenance treatment (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCINQAERO should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the \nabove-mentioned indication (see section 4.1). \n \nPosology \nCINQAERO is given as intravenous infusion once every four weeks.  \n \nPatients below 35 kg or above 199 kg \nThe recommended dose is 3 mg/kg body weight. The volume (in mL) required from the vial(s) should \nbe calculated as follows: 0.3 x patient body weight (in kg). \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPatients between 35 kg and 199 kg \nThe recommended dose is achieved using the vial-based dosing scheme in Table 1 below. The \nrecommended dose is based on patient body weight and should only be adjusted for significant \nchanges in body weight. \n \nTable 1: Vial-based dosing scheme* for patients with body weight between 35 kg and 199 kg \nBody weight \n(kg) \n\nReslizumab total dose \n(mg) \n\nNumbers of each vial** \nVials with 10 mL \nconcentrate \n(100 mg reslizumab) \n\nVials with 2.5 mL \nconcentrate \n(25 mg reslizumab) \n\n35-41 100 1 0 \n42-49 125 1 1 \n50-58 150 1 2 \n59-66 175 1 3 \n67-74 200 2 0 \n75-83 225 2 1 \n84-91 250 2 2 \n92-99 275 2 3 \n100-108 300 3 0 \n109-116 325 3 1 \n117-124 350 3 2 \n125-133 375 3 3 \n134-141 400 4 0 \n142-149 425 4 1 \n150-158 450 4 2 \n159-166 475 4 3 \n167-174 500 5 0 \n175-183 525 5 1 \n184-191*** 550 5 2 \n192-199*** 575 5 3 \n* This dosing scheme is based on a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg. \n** The nominal volume of the vials (10 mL or 2.5 mL for each vial) has to be used. \n*** Patients weighing more than 188 kg were not studied. \n \n \nTreatment duration \nCINQAERO is intended for long-term treatment. \n \nA decision to continue the therapy should be made at least annually based on disease severity and \nlevel of exacerbation control. \n \nMissed dose \nIf a reslizumab infusion is missed on the planned date, dosing should resume as soon as possible on \nthe indicated dose and regimen. A double dose must not be administered to make up for a missed dose. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere are limited data available on the use of reslizumab in patients older than 75 years of age. Based \non the similar reslizumab exposure observed in patients older than 65 years of age as compared to \npatients 18 to <65 years of age, no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of CINQAERO in children and adolescents aged up to 17 years have not been \nestablished for the indication of CINQAERO. No data are available for children aged up to 11 years. \nCurrently available data in adolescents from 12 to 17 years are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, \nbut no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n \nMethod of administration \nIntravenous use. \n \nCINQAERO is for intravenous infusion only. It must not be administered by the subcutaneous, oral or \nintramuscular route. \n \nThe appropriate volume of CINQAERO should be dispensed into an infusion bag containing 50 mL \nsodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n \nThe diluted medicinal product should then be administered as a 20 – 50-minute intravenous infusion \nthrough a sterile, non-pyrogenic infusion, single-use, low protein binding filter (0.2 µm). CINQAERO \nmust not be administered as a bolus injection or as undiluted concentrate. \n \nThe infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a hypersensitivity reaction to \nreslizumab or to any of the excipients (see section 4.4). \n \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nReslizumab should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. \n \nAsthma-related symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be instructed \nto seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity and administration-related reactions \nAcute systemic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported in association with \nreslizumab (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions were observed during or within 20 minutes after \ncompletion of the infusion. Patients should be monitored during and for an appropriate time after \nadministration of reslizumab. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, administration of reslizumab should \nbe stopped immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be provided; reslizumab must be \ndiscontinued permanently (see section 4.3). \n \nParasitic (helminth) infections \nEosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients \nwith pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before starting reslizumab therapy. If patients \nbecome infected whilst receiving treatment with reslizumab and do not respond to anti-helminth \ntreatment, temporary discontinuation of therapy should be considered. \n \nSodium content \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \n‘sodium-free’. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with reslizumab. In vitro data indicate \nthat IL-5 and reslizumab are unlikely to affect CYP1A2, 3A4 or 2B6 activity. Based on the \ncharacteristics of reslizumab, drug-drug interactions are not expected. Results of population \npharmacokinetic analysis confirm that concomitant use of either leukotriene antagonists or systemic \ncorticosteroids does not affect the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab (see section 5.2). \n \nReslizumab has not been studied in patients concurrently taking immunosuppressant medicinal \nproducts other than oral corticosteroids (OCS); therefore, the safety and efficacy profile of reslizumab \nin these patients is unknown. \n \nReslizumab has not been studied in patients receiving live vaccines. No data are available on the \nsecondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving \nreslizumab or the response to new immunisations in patients receiving reslizumab. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of reslizumab \nin pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nreproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of CINQAERO \nduring pregnancy. Reslizumab has a long half-life (see section 5.2). This should be taken into \nconsideration. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether reslizumab is excreted in human milk. Available \npharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of reslizumab in milk. In \nhumans, during the first few days after birth antibodies may be transferred to the newborns through \nmilk. In this short period, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Afterwards, CINQAERO \ncould be used during breast-feeding if appropriate. \n \nFertility \nThere are no fertility data in humans. Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCINQAERO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment was increased blood creatine \nphosphokinase, which occurred in approximately 2% of patients. Anaphylactic reaction (see \nsection 4.4) occurred in less than 1% of patients. \n \nDuring controlled clinical studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to any adverse \nevent was 5% for both the 3 mg/kg reslizumab and placebo groups. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nOverall, 2,195 subjects received at least one dose of reslizumab. Of these subjects, 1,006 asthma \npatients were exposed for at least 6 months, 759 exposed for at least 1 year and 237 exposed for longer \nthan 2 years (up to 3 years).The following adverse reactions have been reported with reslizumab \nduring placebo-controlled asthma studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment with a 3 mg/kg dose given \n\n\n\n6 \n\nintravenously (1,028 patients). Adverse reactions are listed below in Table 2 by system organ class \nand frequency (frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions \nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nImmune system disorders Uncommon Anaphylactic reaction* \nMusculoskeletal and connective \ntissue disorders \n\nUncommon Myalgia* \n\nInvestigations Common Blood creatine phosphokinase \nincreased* \n\n*See subsection “Description of selected adverse reactions” below \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nAnaphylactic reaction \nThe serious adverse reaction of anaphylactic reaction was reported and considered related to \nreslizumab in 3 patients (0.19%) during placebo-controlled and open-label asthma studies. These \nreactions were observed during or within 20 minutes after completion of the reslizumab infusion and \nwere reported as early as the second dose of reslizumab. They were fully resolved with standard \ntreatment with no residual effect. Manifestations included skin or mucosal involvement, dyspnoea, \nwheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms and chills. These cases resulted in the discontinuation of \ntreatment. Due to an overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between an \nanaphylactic reaction, another hypersensitivity reaction and an infusion-related reaction in all cases \n(see section 4.4). \n \nMyalgia \nMyalgia was reported in 0.97% of patients (10 out of 1,028) in the 3 mg/kg reslizumab group of the \nplacebo-controlled asthma studies compared with 0.55% of patients (4 out of 730) in the placebo \ngroup. \n \nBlood creatine phosphokinase increased \nBlood creatine phosphokinase elevations were transient and asymptomatic, and did not lead to \ntreatment discontinuation. \n \nMalignancies \nIn placebo-controlled clinical studies, 6 out of 1,028 patients (0.6%) receiving 3 mg/kg reslizumab had \nat least one malignant neoplasm reported compared to 2 out of 730 patients (0.3%) in the placebo \ngroup. The malignancies observed in reslizumab-treated patients were diverse in nature and without \nclustering of any particular tissue type. \n \nPaediatric population \nExperience in paediatric patients is limited (see section 5.1). The data did not indicate a difference in \nthe safety profile of reslizumab in paediatric patients compared with that in adult patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe highest single dose administered intravenously was reported at 12.1 mg/kg and had no clinical \nconsequences for the patient. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for \nany signs or symptoms of adverse effects and given appropriate symptomatic treatment. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for \nobstructive airway diseases; ATC code: R03DX08 \n \nMechanism of action \nReslizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG4, κ) against the human interleukin-5 (IL-5). \nReslizumab binds specifically to IL-5 and interferes with IL-5 binding to its cell-surface receptor. IL-5 \nis a key cytokine responsible for the differentiation, maturation, recruitment and activation of human \neosinophils. Reslizumab binds human IL-5 with picomolar affinity blocking its biological function; \nconsequently survival and activity of eosinophils are reduced. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nEffect on sputum eosinophils \nThe effect of reslizumab in patients with asthma and elevated sputum eosinophil counts (at least 3%) \nwas evaluated in a 15-week, phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with \nreslizumab 3 mg/kg. Sputum eosinophils were measured in a subset of 38 adult patients at the end of \ntherapy. In this study, the percentage of sputum eosinophils was reduced from a mean baseline value \nof 17.4% (standard deviation: 15.9%) by 82% at end of therapy in the reslizumab group. \n \nEffect on blood eosinophils \nIn clinical Studies I and II with reslizumab 3 mg/kg, decreases in blood eosinophil counts were seen \nfollowing the first dose and maintained through 52 weeks of treatment with no signs of tachyphylaxis. \nIn pooled data, mean eosinophil counts were 655 µL-1 (n=476) and 654 µL-1 (n=477) for the placebo \nand reslizumab treatment groups at baseline and were 514 µL-1 (n=405) and 61 µL-1 (n=407) at \nweek 52. Eosinophils began to return towards baseline in those reslizumab patients completing a \n90-day follow-up assessment (394 µL-1, n=36). Decreases in blood eosinophils were related to \nreslizumab levels. \n \nThe reduction in blood eosinophil counts by reslizumab in anti-reslizumab antibody-positive patients \nwas not different from patients who were anti-reslizumab antibody-negative. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nOverview of clinical efficacy \nThe efficacy of reslizumab in eosinophilic asthma (blood eosinophils ≥400 µL-1) was evaluated in \nthree randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies I to III) from 16 to 52 weeks’ \nduration involving 1268 patients with moderate to severe asthma inadequately controlled on medium- \nto high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (at least 440 μg of fluticasone propionate daily or \nequivalent) with or without other controllers; prior stable allergen immunotherapy was allowed. \n \nStudies I and II were 52-week, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in patients who had at least one \nasthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroid use over the past twelve months. Maintenance \nOCS (up to 10 mg per day prednisone equivalent) were allowed. The patients received either 13 doses \nof placebo or reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks. \n \nStudy III was a 16-week, randomised, placebo-controlled study. There was no prior asthma \nexacerbation requirement for this study. Maintenance OCS was not allowed. The patients received \neither four doses of placebo or reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks. \n \nTable 3 presents the demographics and baseline characteristics of Studies I, II and III. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 3: Demographics and baseline characteristics of asthma studies I - III \nDemographic or \nbaseline characteristic \n\nStudy I \n(n=489) \n\nStudy II \n(n=464) \n\nStudy III \n(n=315) \n\nDemographics    \nAge, mean in years 46.65 46.97 43.89 \nAsthma duration, \nmean in years \n\n19.28 18.41 20.35 \n\nPulmonary function \ntests \n\n   \n\nPre-bronchodilator \nFEV1a, mean % \npredicted \n\n64.31 69.21 70.14 \n\nEosinophil counts    \nBaseline mean blood \neosinophil count, µL-1 \n\n660 649 614 \n\nExacerbation history    \nMean number of \nexacerbations in \nprevious year \n\n1.99 1.94 2.03 \n\nProportions of \npatients in GINA \nsteps 4 and 5c \n\n   \n\nGINA 4, % 68 70 79 \nGINA 5, % 13 9 <1 \n\nPatients with \nrefractory asthmad \n\n   \n\n% 34 31 NAb \na FEV1=forced expiratory volume in 1 second \nb NA=not available \nc The GINA classification is based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) definition: \n GINA step 4 patients received medium- to high-dose ICS plus another controller. \n GINA step 5 patients received in addition, as an add-on, maintenance OCS. \nd The percentage of patients with refractory asthma (based on the American Thoracic Society \n\n[ATS]/European Respiratory Society [ERS] 2000 workshop definition for refractory asthma) from \nStudies I and II was analysed post hoc. \n\n \nStudies I and II \nThe primary efficacy measure for both Studies I and II was the frequency of asthma exacerbations for \neach patient during the 52-week treatment period. In both studies, an asthma exacerbation was defined \nas a worsening of asthma that required the following medical intervention:  \n1) use of systemic corticosteroids or an increase in the use of ICS treatment for 3 or more days, and/or  \n2) asthma-related emergency treatment including at least one of the following: an unscheduled visit to \ntheir healthcare professional for nebuliser treatment or other urgent treatment to prevent worsening of \nasthma symptoms; a visit to the emergency room for asthma-related treatment; or asthma-related \nhospitalisation. \n \nOverall population \nIn Studies I and II, patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg had significant reductions in asthma \nexacerbations (50% and 59%, respectively) compared to placebo (see Table 4).

A reduction in asthma \nexacerbations resulting in hospitalisation or an emergency room visit was observed with reslizumab \n3 mg/kg that was not statistically significant (34% [p=0.2572] and 31% [p=0.4020] in Study I and \nStudy II, respectively). \n \nThe proportion of patients who did not experience an asthma exacerbation during the 52-week \ntreatment period was higher in the reslizumab 3 mg/kg group (62% and 75%) compared with the \nplacebo group (46% and 55%), in Studies I and II, respectively. \n \nPatients with severe eosinophilic asthma \nIn Studies I and II, severe eosinophilic asthma is defined as any patients falling into GINA \nsteps 4 and 5 (medium- to high-dose ICS [≥ 440 µg fluticasone propionate] plus another controller, \nwith or without maintenance OCS) with a blood eosinophil count of ≥400 µL-1 at start of treatment. A \ncohort of 763 patients within Studies I and II met this criterion; the primary efficacy outcome is \npresented in Table 4. In integrated Studies I and II, patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg had \nsignificant reductions in asthma exacerbations (56% for subgroup GINA 4 and 5) compared to \nplacebo. \n \nThe effect of reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks on secondary endpoints, including \nFEV1, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and \nAsthma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI), further supports the efficacy of reslizumab 3 mg/kg compared \nto placebo.

Results were supported by the \nsecondary efficacy endpoints and were in line with the overall population. \n \nStudy III \nThe primary endpoint was the change from baseline over 16 weeks in FEV1. In Study III, patients \nreceiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg had significantly larger increases in FEV1 from baseline compared to \nplacebo (treatment difference: 160 mL, p=0.0018). Improvements were noted in FEV1 at 4 weeks \nfollowing the first dose of reslizumab. \n \nImmunogenicity \nIn phase 3 placebo-controlled studies with a duration of 16 to 52 weeks, low-titre, frequently transient \nanti-reslizumab antibodies were detected in 53 out of 983 asthma patients (5%) receiving reslizumab \nat 3 mg/kg. In an open-label phase 3 extension study, low-titre, frequently transient anti-reslizumab \nantibodies were detected in 49 out of 1,014 asthma patients (5%) who received 3 mg/kg reslizumab for \nup to 36 months. Systemic exposure to reslizumab appears to be unaffected by anti-reslizumab \nantibodies. The antibodies had no impact on clinical pharmacodynamics, efficacy or safety. \n \nEthnicity \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is not \nsignificantly different between ethnic groups (white, black and Asian). There are limited safety data in \nnon-white ethnic populations. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nCINQAERO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \n39 paediatric asthma patients from 12 to 17 years were randomised to reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg, \nreslizumab 3 mg/kg or placebo as part of two 52-week exacerbation studies (Studies I and II) and one \n16-week lung function study (Study III). In Studies I and II only, patients were required to have at \nleast one asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroid use in the year prior to study entry. \nAsthma exacerbations were evaluated only in the exacerbation studies (Studies I and II: reslizumab \n\n\n\n11 \n\n3 mg/kg [n=14] and placebo [n=11]). No treatment effect on asthma exacerbations was observed for \nthis age group (asthma exacerbation rate ratio [reslizumab/placebo] of 2.09). Given the small sample \nsize and baseline imbalances resulting from subgroup analysis, no conclusion can be drawn regarding \nasthma efficacy in the paediatric population. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPeak serum concentrations of approximately 80 µg/mL are typically observed at the end of the \ninfusion. Serum reslizumab concentrations generally decline from peak in a biphasic manner. \nFollowing multiple doses, serum concentrations of reslizumab accumulate approximately 1.5- to \n1.9-fold. No apparent deviation from dose-proportional reslizumab pharmacokinetics was noted over \nthe dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg. Inter-individual variability in peak and overall exposure is \napproximately 20-30% \n \nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis, systemic exposure to reslizumab appears to be \nunaffected by circulating anti-reslizumab antibodies. \n \nDistribution \nReslizumab has a volume of distribution of approximately 5 L, suggesting minimal distribution to the \nextravascular tissues. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn common with other monoclonal antibodies, reslizumab is believed to be degraded by enzymatic \nproteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. As reslizumab binds to a soluble target, linear \nnon-target-mediated clearance is expected. \n \nElimination \nReslizumab clearance is approximately 7 mL/hour. Reslizumab has a half-life of about 24 days. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of reslizumab was similar in adults (18-65 years of age; n=759) and elderly \npatients (greater than 65 years of age; n=30). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe range of systemic exposures in patients from 12 to less than 18 years of age (n=15) overlapped \nthat in the other groups although the median value was slightly lower than in adult patients \n(18-65 years of age; n=759) and elderly patients (greater than 65 years of age; n=30). \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of reslizumab was not significantly different between males and females. \n \nEthnicity \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is not \nsignificantly different between ethnic groups (white, black and Asian). \n \nHepatic Impairment \nReslizumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No direct effect of hepatic \nfunction on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is expected because antibodies are principally cleared \nby catabolism. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, patients were classified by baseline liver \nfunction levels. Most patients had normal liver function tests (n=766, approximately 95%) or mildly \nincreased liver function tests (either, in the first case, total bilirubin above the upper limit of normal \n[ULN] but less than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN or, in the second case, aspartate aminotransferase \ngreater than the ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to the ULN; n=35, approximately 4%). No \nsignificant difference in the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab was observed across these groups. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nRenal Impairment \nReslizumab is an antibody with a molecular mass of 147 kDaltons and is therefore not expected to be \nexcreted in urine. Most patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function \n(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=294, \napproximately 37%), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=446, approximately \n56%), or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=63, approximately 8%). No \nnoteworthy differences in the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab were observed across these renal \nfunction groups. Reslizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or end \nstage renal disease. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to \nreproduction and development. \n \n \n6.

The solution for \ninfusion is intended only for intravenous use after dilution and should be prepared using aseptic \ntechnique as follows: \n \nPreparation of solution for infusion \n1. Remove CINQAERO from the refrigerator. Do not shake the vial. \n2. The medicinal product should be inspected visually before use. The concentrate is clear to \n\nslightly hazy opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow. Proteinaceous particles may be present in \nthe concentrate that appear as translucent to white, amorphous particles, some of which may \nlook fibrous. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The concentrate must not be used \nif coloured (except slightly yellow) or if foreign particles are present. \n\n3. A suitable injection syringe should be used to withdraw the needed amount of the concentrate \nfrom the vial(s) (see section 4.2).  \n\n4. Slowly dispense the contents of the syringe(s) into an infusion bag containing 50 mL of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. This \nmedicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n\n5. The concentrate does not contain any preservatives. Any concentrate remaining in the vial must \nbe discarded. \n\n6. It is recommended that the solution for infusion be administered immediately after preparation. \nSolutions of CINQAERO diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion may \nbe stored refrigerated at 2 °C-8 °C (or not above 25 °C if dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions), protected from light for up to 16 hours. \n\n7. CINQAERO is compatible with polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) infusion bags. \n \nInstructions for administration \n1. CINQAERO should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage \n\nhypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section 4.4). The patient has to be \nobserved over the duration of the infusion and for an appropriate period afterwards. Patients \nshould be instructed on how to recognise symptoms of serious allergic reactions. \n\n2. If the solution for infusion has been stored in a refrigerator, allow it to reach room temperature \n(15 °C-25 °C). \n\n3. The solution for infusion should be infused intravenously over 20 – 50 minutes. Infusion time \nmay vary depending on the total volume to be infused. \n\n4. The solution for infusion should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with \nother medicinal products. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been \nconducted to evaluate the co-administration of reslizumab with other medicinal products. \n\n5. An infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of \n0.2 µm) should be used for infusion. CINQAERO is compatible with polyethersulfone (PES), \npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nylon, cellulose acetate (CA) low protein binding in-line \ninfusion filters. \n\n\n\n14 \n\n6. Upon completion of the infusion, flush the infusion set with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for infusion to ensure that all of the CINQAERO solution for infusion has been \nadministered. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What CINQAERO is and what it is used for \n \nWhat CINQAERO is \nCINQAERO is a medicine containing the active substance reslizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type \nof protein that recognises and binds to a specific target substance in the body. \n \nHow CINQAERO works \nCINQAERO blocks interleukin-5 activity and reduces the number of eosinophils in your blood and \nlungs. Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. Interleukin-5 is a protein \nyour body makes that plays a key role in inflammation in asthma by activating eosinophils. \n \nWhat CINQAERO is used for \nCINQAERO is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adult patients (18 years of age and over) \nwhen the condition is not well controlled despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids \ntogether with another asthma medicine. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma where patients have \ntoo many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. CINQAERO is used together with other medicines to treat \nasthma (inhaled corticosteroids plus other asthma medicines). \n \nWhat are the benefits of using CINQAERO \nCINQAERO reduces how often you have flare-ups of your asthma, helps you breathe better and \ndecreases your asthma symptoms. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given CINQAERO \n \nYou must not receive CINQAERO: \n- if you are allergic to reslizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \n\n\n\n25 \n\nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given CINQAERO: \n- if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common \n\nor if you are travelling to such a region, as this medicine may weaken your body’s ability to \nfight certain types of parasitic infections. \n\n \nAlso, talk to your doctor or nurse when you are given CINQAERO: \n- if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine; \n- if you have any of the symptoms of an allergic reaction (e.g. itching, trouble breathing, \n\nwheezing, fever, shivering, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, skin \nrash, redness or swelling). Serious allergic reactions have occurred in patients receiving this \nmedicine (see section “4. Possible side effects”). \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine is NOT intended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and CINQAERO \nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nThis is particularly important: \n- if you are receiving other medicines which affect your immune system; \n- if you have recently received a vaccination or if you are likely to need a vaccination. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n \nThe active substance in this medicine may pass into breast milk but only during the first few days after \nbirth. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is unlikely that CINQAERO will affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nCINQAERO contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How CINQAERO is given \n \nAlways follow the instructions exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are \nnot sure. \n \nThe dose depends on your body weight. Your doctor will work out the right dose for you. The \nmaximum dose is 3 mg per kg of body weight. CINQAERO will be given every 4 weeks. You will be \ngiven CINQAERO by a doctor or nurse as an infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion will take about \n20 to 50 minutes. \n \nIt may take more than one dose before your asthma symptoms improve. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will watch you closely during and after your infusion for signs of an allergic \nreaction. \n \nIf you miss your scheduled dose of CINQAERO \nIf you miss a scheduled dose of CINQAERO, ask your doctor when to schedule your next treatment. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIf you stop using CINQAERO \nDo NOT stop treatment with CINQAERO unless your doctor tells you to, even if you feel better. \nInterrupting or stopping treatment with this medicine may cause your asthma symptoms to come back. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \n \n• Serious allergic reactions \n\nSerious allergic reactions can happen uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) while \nreceiving CINQAERO or afterwards. Your doctor or nurse will watch you closely for signs of a \nreaction. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any of the symptoms of an allergic \nreaction (e.g. itching, trouble breathing, wheezing, fever, shivering, dizziness, headache, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal discomfort, skin rash, redness or swelling). \n\n \nOther side effects \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n• Increase of an enzyme in your blood (blood creatine phosphokinase). \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n• Muscle pain (myalgia). \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store CINQAERO \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton and label after EXP. \nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 °C-8 ºC). Do not freeze. \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater.

The solution for \ninfusion is intended only for intravenous use after dilution and should be prepared using aseptic \ntechnique as follows: \n \nPreparation of solution for infusion \n1. Remove CINQAERO from the refrigerator. Do not shake the vial. \n2. The medicinal product should be inspected visually before use. The concentrate is clear to \n\nslightly hazy opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow. Proteinaceous particles may be present in \nthe concentrate that appear as translucent to white, amorphous particles, some of which may \n\n\n\n29 \n\nlook fibrous. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The concentrate must not be used \nif coloured (except slightly yellow) or if foreign particles are present. \n\n3. A suitable injection syringe should be used to withdraw the needed amount of concentrate from \nthe vial(s) (see section 4.2 of Summary of Product Characteristics). \n\n4. Slowly dispense the contents of the syringe(s) into an infusion bag containing 50 mL of sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. This \nmedicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. \n\n5. The concentrate does not contain any preservatives. Any concentrate remaining in the vial must \nbe discarded. \n\n6. It is recommended that the solution for infusion be administered immediately after preparation. \nSolutions of CINQAERO diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion may \nbe stored refrigerated at 2 °C-8 °C (or not above 25 °C if dilution has taken place in controlled \nand validated aseptic conditions), protected from light for up to 16 hours. \n\n7. CINQAERO is compatible with polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) infusion bags. \n \nInstructions for administration \n1. CINQAERO should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage \n\nhypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section 4.4 of Summary of Product \nCharacteristics). The patient has to be observed over the duration of the infusion and for an \nappropriate period afterwards. Patients should be instructed on how to recognise symptoms of \nserious allergic reactions. \n\n2. If the solution for infusion has been stored in a refrigerator, allow it to reach room temperature \n(15 °C-25 °C). \n\n3. The solution for infusion should be infused intravenously over 20 – 50 minutes. Infusion time \nmay vary depending on the total volume to be infused. \n\n4. The solution for infusion should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with \nother medicinal products. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been \nconducted to evaluate the co-administration of reslizumab with other medicinal products. \n\n5. An infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of \n0.2 µm) should be used for infusion. CINQAERO is compatible with polyethersulfone (PES), \npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nylon, cellulose acetate (CA) low protein binding in-line \ninfusion filters. \n\n6. Upon completion of the infusion, flush the infusion set with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for infusion to ensure that all of the CINQAERO solution for infusion has been \nadministered. \n\n \nFor dosing instructions see section 4.2 of Summary of Product Characteristics. \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
