NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nThalidomide Celgene 50 mg hard capsules \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nEach capsule contains 50 mg of thalidomide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nHard capsule. \n\nWhite opaque capsules marked “Thalidomide Celgene 50 mg”. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nThalidomide Celgene in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated as first line treatment \n\nof patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible for high dose \n\nchemotherapy. \n\n \n\nThalidomide Celgene is prescribed and dispensed according to the Thalidomide Celgene Pregnancy \n\nPrevention Programme (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nTreatment must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of physicians with expertise in \n\nmanaging immunomodulatory or chemotherapeutic agents and a full understanding of the risks of \n\nthalidomide therapy and monitoring requirements (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose of thalidomide is 200 mg orally per day. \n\n \n\nA maximum number of 12 cycles of 6 weeks (42 days) should be used. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Starting doses for thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone \n\nAge \n\n(years) \n\nANC* \n\n(/µL) \n\n Platelet Count \n\n(/µL) \n\nThalidomidea,b Melphalanc,d,e Prednisonef \n\n≤ 75 ≥ 1,500 AND ≥ 100,000 200 mg daily 0.25 mg/kg daily 2 mg/kg daily \n\n≤ 75 < 1,500 but \n\n≥ 1,000 \n\nOR < 100,000 but \n\n≥ 50,000 \n\n200 mg daily 0.125 mg/kg daily 2 mg/kg daily \n\n> 75 ≥ 1,500 AND ≥ 100,000 100 mg daily 0.20 mg/kg daily 2 mg/kg daily \n\n> 75 < 1,500 but \n\n≥ 1,000 \n\nOR < 100,000 but \n\n≥ 50,000 \n\n100 mg daily 0.10 mg/kg daily 2 mg/kg daily \n\n* ANC: Absolute Neutrophil Count \n\na Thalidomide dosed once daily at bedtime on Days 1 to 42 of each 42-day cycle. \nb Due to the sedative effect associated with thalidomide, administration at bedtime is known to generally improve tolerability. \nc Melphalan dosed once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 42-day cycle. \nd Melphalan dosing: reduce by 50 % for moderate (creatinine clearance: ≥ 30 but < 50 mL/min) or severe (CrCl: < 30mL/min) renal \n\ninsufficiency \ne Maximum daily melphalan dose: 24 mg (subjects ≤ 75 years old) or 20 mg (subjects > 75 years old). \nf Prednisone dosed once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 42-day cycle. \n\n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nPatients should be monitored for: thromboembolic events, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin \n\nreactions, bradycardia, syncope, somnolence, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (see sections 4.4 \n\nand 4.8). Dose delay, reduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC (National Cancer \n\nInstitute Common Toxicity Criteria) grade, may be necessary. \n\n \n\nIf less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more than \n\n12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take the dose, but \n\ntake the next dose at the normal time on the following day. \n \n\nThromboembolic events \n\nThromboprophylaxis should be administered for at least the first 5 months of treatment especially in \n\npatients with additional thrombotic risk factors. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicinal products, such \n\nas low molecular weight heparins or warfarin, should be recommended. The decision to take \n\nantithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made after careful assessment of an individual \n\npatient’s underlying risk factors (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nIf the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard \n\nanticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment \n\nand any complications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the thalidomide treatment \n\nmay be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit-risk assessment. The patient should \n\ncontinue anticoagulation therapy during the course of thalidomide treatment. \n\n \n\nNeutropenia \n\nWhite blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, in accordance with \n\noncology guidelines, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia. Dose delay, \n\nreduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC grade, may be necessary. \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nPlatelet counts should be monitored on an ongoing basis, in accordance with oncology guidelines. \n\nDose delay, reduction or discontinuation, dependent upon the NCI CTC grade, may be necessary. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nDose modifications due to peripheral neuropathy are described in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Recommended dose modifications for thalidomide -related neuropathy in first line \n\ntreatment of multiple myeloma \n\nSeverity of neuropathy Modification of dose and regimen \n\nGrade 1 (paraesthesia, weakness and/or loss of \n\nreflexes) with no loss of function  \n\nContinue to monitor the patient with clinical \n\nexamination. Consider reducing dose if symptoms \n\nworsen. However, dose reduction is not \n\nnecessarily followed by improvement of \n\nsymptoms. \n\nGrade 2 (interfering with function but not with \n\nactivities of daily living) \n\nReduce dose or interrupt treatment and continue \n\nto monitor the patient with clinical and \n\nneurological examination. If no improvement or \n\ncontinued worsening of the neuropathy, \n\ndiscontinue treatment. If the neuropathy resolves \n\nto Grade 1 or better, the treatment may be \n\nrestarted, if the benefit/risk is favourable. \n\nGrade 3 (interfering with activities of daily \n\nliving) \n\nDiscontinue treatment  \n\nGrade 4 (neuropathy which is disabling) Discontinue treatment \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\nThalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. \n\nThalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or \n\nbullous rash, or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or drug reaction \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nwith eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is suspected and should not be resumed following \n\ndiscontinuation for these reactions. \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\nNo specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly ≤ 75 years of age. For patients \n\n> 75 years of age, the thalidomide recommended starting dose is 100 mg per day. The initial dose of \n\nmelphalan is reduced for elderly > 75 years of age considering baseline bone marrow reserve and renal \n\nfunction. The melphalan recommended starting dose is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg daily according to bone \n\nmarrow reserve along with a further 50 % dose reduction for moderate (creatinine clearance: ≥ 30 but \n\n< 50 mL/minute) or severe (CrCl: < 30 mL/minute) renal insufficiency. The maximum daily \n\nmelphalan dose is 20 mg in patients > 75 years of age (see Table 1). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nThalidomide Celgene has not formally been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. \n\nNo specific dose recommendations for these patient populations are available. Patients with severe \n\norgan impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Thalidomide Celgene in the paediatric population in the indication of \n\nmultiple myeloma. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nThalidomide Celgene should be taken as a single dose at bedtime, to reduce the impact of somnolence. \n\nCapsules should not be opened or crushed (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nIt is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister, thereby \n\nreducing the risk of capsule deformation or breakage. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n• Hypersensitivity to thalidomide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n• Women who are pregnant (see section 4.6). \n\n• Women of childbearing potential unless all the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention \nProgramme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n• Male patients unable to follow or comply with the required contraceptive measures (see \nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nTeratogenic effects \n\nThalidomide is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-\n\nthreatening birth defects. Thalidomide must never be used by women who are pregnant or by \n\nwomen who could become pregnant unless all the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention \n\nProgramme are met. The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for \n\nall male and female patients. \n\n \n\nCriteria for women of non-childbearing potential \n\nA female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential \n\nunless she meets at least one of the following criteria: \n\n• Age  50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for  1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy \nor during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential). \n\n• Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist. \n\n• Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy. \n\n• XY genotype, Turner’s syndrome, uterine agenesis. \n \n\nCounselling \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nFor women of childbearing potential, thalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following \n\nconditions are met: \n\n• She understands the teratogenic risk to the unborn child \n\n• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks \nbefore starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after \n\nthe end of treatment \n\n• Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on \neffective contraception \n\n• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures \n\n• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to \nrapidly consult her doctor if there is a risk of pregnancy \n\n• She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as thalidomide is dispensed \nfollowing a negative pregnancy test \n\n• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing every 4 weeks except in case \nof confirmed tubal sterilisation \n\n• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with \nthe use of thalidomide. \n\n \n\nAs thalidomide is found in semen, as a precaution all male patients taking thalidomide must meet the \n\nfollowing conditions: \n\n• He understands the teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a \nwoman of childbearing potential.  \n\n• He understands the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant \nwoman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man \n\nhas had a vasectomy), during treatment, during dose interruption and for at least 7 days \n\nfollowing discontinuation of treatment.  \n\n• He understands that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking thalidomide or 7 \ndays after he has stopped taking thalidomide, he should inform his treating physician \n\nimmediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or \n\nexperienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nThe prescriber must ensure that: \n\n• The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme including \nconfirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding \n\n• The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. \n \n\nContraception \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks \n\nbefore start of treatment, during treatment, and until at least 4 weeks after thalidomide treatment and \n\neven in case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence \n\nconfirmed on a monthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be \n\nreferred preferably to an appropriately trained healthcare professional for contraceptive advice in order \n\nthat contraception can be initiated. \n\n \n\nThe following can be considered to be examples of effective methods of contraception: \n\n• Implant \n\n• Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) \n\n• Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot \n\n• Tubal sterilisation \n\n• Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two \nnegative semen analyses \n\n• Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) \n \n\nBecause of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), \n\ncombined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see section 4.5). If a patient is currently using \n\n\n\n 6 \n\ncombined oral contraception, she should switch to one of the effective methods listed above. The risk \n\nof venous thromboembolism continues for 4-6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral contraception. \n\n \n\nPregnancy testing \n\nMedically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/ml must be performed for \n\nwomen of childbearing potential as outlined below. This requirement includes women of childbearing \n\npotential who practice absolute and continuous abstinence. \n\n \n\nPrior to starting treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when thalidomide \n\nis prescribed or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been using \n\neffective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when \n\nshe starts treatment with thalidomide. \n\n \n\nFollow-up and end of treatment \n\nA medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated every 4 weeks, including 4 weeks after the \n\nend of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy tests should be \n\nperformed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. \n\n \n\nMen \n\nAs thalidomide is found in semen, as a precaution all male patients must use condoms during \n\ntreatment, during dose interruption and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of treatment if \n\ntheir partner is pregnant or is of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. \n\nMale patients should not donate semen or sperm during treatment (including during dose \n\ninterruptions) and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of thalidomide. \n\n \n\nPrescribing and dispensing restrictions \n\nFor women of childbearing potential, prescriptions of thalidomide can be for a maximum duration of \n\ntreatment of 4 weeks according to the approved indications dosing regimens (see section 4.2) and \n\ncontinuation of treatment requires a new prescription. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription \n\nand dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of thalidomide should occur within a \n\nmaximum of 7 days of the prescription. \n\n \n\nFor all other patients, prescriptions of thalidomide can be for a maximum duration of treatment of \n\n12 weeks and continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. \n\n \n\nAdditional precautions \n\nPatients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any \n\nunused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. \n\n \n\nPatients should not donate blood during treatment (including during dose interruptions) and for  at \n\nleast 7 days following discontinuation of thalidomide. \n\n \n\nHealthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or \n\ncapsule. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or \n\ncapsule (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nEducational materials \n\nIn order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to thalidomide, the Marketing Authorisation \n\nHolder will provide educational material to healthcare professionals to reinforce the warnings about \n\nthe teratogenicity of thalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before treatment is started and \n\nprovides guidance on the need for pregnancy testing.  \n\nThe prescriber must inform male and female patients about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict \n\npregnancy prevention measures as specified in the Pregnancy Prevention Programme and provide \n\npatients with appropriate educational brochure for patients, patient card and/or equivalent tool in \n\naccordance to the national implemented patient card system. A national controlled distribution system \n\nhas been implemented in collaboration with each National Competent Authority. The controlled \n\n\n\n 7 \n\ndistribution system includes the use of a patient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or \n\ndispensing controls, and the collecting of detailed data relating to the indication in order to monitor \n\nclosely the off-label use within the national territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription \n\nand dispensing should occur on the same day. Dispensing of thalidomide to women of childbearing \n\npotential should occur within 7 days of the prescription and following a medically supervised negative \n\npregnancy test result. \n\n \n\nAmenorrhea \n\nThe use of thalidomide could be associated with menstrual disorders including amenorrhea. \n\nAmenorrhea during thalidomide therapy should be assumed to result from pregnancy, until it is \n\nmedically confirmed that the patient is not pregnant. A clear mechanism by which thalidomide can \n\ninduce amenorrhea is not elucidated. The reported events occurred in young (premenopausal) women \n\n(median age 36 years) receiving thalidomide for non-multiple myeloma indications, had an onset \n\nwithin 6 months of initiating treatment and reversed upon discontinuation of thalidomide. In \n\ndocumented case reports with hormone evaluation, the event of amenorrhoea was associated with \n\ndecreased estradiol levels and elevated FSH/LH levels. When provided, antiovary antibodies were \n\nnegative and prolactin level was within the normal range. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular disorders \n\nMyocardial infarction \n\nMyocardial infarction (MI) has been reported in patients receiving thalidomide, particularly in those \n\nwith known risk factors. Patients with known risk factors for MI, including prior thrombosis, should \n\nbe closely monitored and action should be taken to try to minimise all modifiable risk factors \n\n(e.g. smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). \n\n \n\nVenous and arterial thromboembolic events \n\nPatients treated with thalidomide have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep \n\nvein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolism (such as myocardial \n\ninfarction and cerebrovascular event) (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be greatest during the first \n\n5 months of therapy. Thromboprophylaxis and dosing/anticoagulation therapy recommendations are \n\nprovided in section 4.2. \n\n \n\nPrevious history of thromboembolic events or concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or \n\nother agents such as hormone replacement therapy, may also increase thromboembolic risk in these \n\npatients. Therefore, these agents should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving \n\nthalidomide with prednisone and melphalan. Particularly, a haemoglobin concentration above 12g/dl \n\nshould lead to discontinuation of erythropoietic agents. Action should be taken to try to minimize all \n\nmodifiable risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. \n\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of \n\nbreath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nPeripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction to treatment with \n\nthalidomide that may result in irreversible damage (see section 4.8). In a phase 3 study, the median \n\ntime to first neuropathy event was 42.3 weeks. \n\n \n\nIf the patient experiences peripheral neuropathy, follow the dose and schedule modification instruction \n\nprovided in section 4.2. \n\n \n\nCareful monitoring of patients for symptoms of neuropathy is recommended. Symptoms include \n\nparaesthesia, dysaesthesia, discomfort, abnormal co-ordination or weakness. \n\n \n\nIt is recommended that clinical and neurological examinations are performed in patients prior to \n\nstarting thalidomide therapy, and that routine monitoring is carried out regularly during treatment.  \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nMedicinal products known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients \n\nreceiving thalidomide (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nThalidomide may also potentially aggravate existing neuropathy and should therefore not be used in \n\npatients with clinical signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy unless the clinical benefits outweigh \n\nthe risks. \n\n \n\nSyncope, bradycardia and atrioventricular block \n\nPatients should be monitored for syncope, bradycardia and atrioventricular block; dose reduction or \n\ndiscontinuation may be required. \n\n \n\nPulmonary hypertension \n\nCases of pulmonary hypertension, some fatal, have been reported in patients treated with thalidomide. \n\nPatients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to \n\ninitiating and during thalidomide therapy. \n\n \n\nHaematological disorders \n\nNeutropenia  \n\nThe incidence of neutropenia grade 3 or 4 reported as adverse reactions was higher in multiple \n\nmyeloma patients receiving MPT (Melphalan, Prednisone, Thalidomide) than in those receiving MP \n\n(Melphalan, Prednisone): 42.7 % versus 29.5 % respectively (study IFM 99-06). Adverse reactions \n\nfrom post-marketing experience such as febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia were reported with \n\nthalidomide. Patients should be monitored and dose delay, reduction or discontinuation may be \n\nrequired (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nThrombocytopenia \n\nThrombocytopenia, including grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, has been reported in multiple myeloma \n\npatients receiving MPT. Patients should be monitored and dose delay, reduction or discontinuation \n\nmay be required (see section 4.2). Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and \n\nsymptoms of bleeding including petechiae, epistaxis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, especially in \n\ncase of concomitant medicinal product prone to inducing bleeding (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nHepatic disorders \n\nHepatic disorders, mainly abnormal liver test results, were reported. No specific pattern was identified \n\nbetween hepatocellular and cholestatic abnormalities, with some cases having a mixed presentation. \n\nThe majority of the reactions occurred within the first 2 months of therapy and resolved spontaneously \n\nwithout treatment after thalidomide discontinuation. Patients should be monitored for liver function, \n\nparticularly in case of pre-existing liver disorder or concomitant use of medicinal product susceptible \n\nto induce liver dysfunction (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\nCases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous \n\nreactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug \n\nreaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with the use of \n\nThalidomide. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their \n\nprescribers and should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. \n\nThalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2-3 skin rash. \n\nThalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or \n\nbullous rash, or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following \n\ndiscontinuation for these reactions. (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  \n\n \n\nSomnolence \n\nIt is very common that thalidomide causes somnolence. Patients should be instructed to avoid \n\nsituations where somnolence may be a problem and to seek medical advice before taking other \n\nmedicinal products known to cause somnolence. Patients should be monitored and dose reduction may \n\nbe required. \n\n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nPatients should be advised as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required \n\nfor the performance of hazardous tasks (see section 4.7). \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\nThe patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. \n\nThese patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. \n\n \n\nInfections \n\nPatients should be monitored for severe infections including sepsis and septic shock. \n\n \n\nCases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving thalidomide, including serious \n\ncases of herpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. \n\n \n\nSome of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, requiring a \n\ntemporary hold of the treatment with thalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. \n\n \n\nSome of the cases of HBV reactivation progressed to acute hepatic failure and resulted in \n\ndiscontinuation of thalidomide. Hepatitis B virus status should be established before initiating \n\ntreatment with thalidomide. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a \n\nphysician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. \n\n \n\nPreviously infected patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of viral reactivation, \n\nincluding active HBV infection, throughout therapy. \n\n \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) \n\nA statistically significant increase of AML and MDS was observed in one clinical study in patients \n\nwith previously untreated MM receiving the combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide \n\n(MPT). The risk increased over time and was about 2 % after two years and about 4 % after three \n\nyears. An increased incidence of second primary malignancies (SPM) has also been observed in \n\npatients with newly diagnosed MM receiving lenalidomide. Among invasive SPMs, cases of \n\nMDS/AML were observed in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with melphalan or \n\nimmediately following high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. \n\n \n\nThe benefit achieved with thalidomide and the risk of AML and MDS must be taken into account \n\nbefore initiating treatment with thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone. \n\nPhysicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using standard cancer \n\nscreening and institute treatment as indicated. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nStudies conducted in healthy subjects and patients with multiple myeloma suggest that thalidomide is \n\nnot influenced to any significant extent by renal or hepatic function (see section 5.2). However, this \n\nhas not formally been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function; therefore patients \n\nwith severe renal or hepatic impairment should be carefully monitored for any adverse events. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nThalidomide is a poor substrate for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and therefore clinically important \n\ninteractions with medicinal products that are inhibitors and/or inducers of this enzyme system are \n\nunlikely. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis of thalidomide, being the primary clearance mechanism, suggests \n\nthat the potential for drug-drug interactions with thalidomide is low. \n\n \n\nIncrease of sedative effects of other medicinal products \n\nThalidomide has sedative properties, thus may enhance the sedation induced by anxiolytics, hypnotics, \n\nantipsychotics, H1 antihistamines, opiate derivatives, barbiturates and alcohol. Caution should be used \n\nwhen thalidomide is given in combination with medicinal products that cause drowsiness. \n\n \n\nBradycardic effect \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nDue to thalidomide’s potential to induce bradycardia, caution should be exercised with medicinal \n\nproducts having the same pharmacodynamic effect such as active substances known to induce torsade \n\nde pointes, beta blockers or anticholinesterase agents. \n\n \n\nMedicinal products known to cause peripheral neuropathy \n\nMedicinal products known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy (e.g. vincristine and \n\nbortezomib) should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide. \n\n \n\nHormonal contraceptives \n\nThalidomide does not interact with hormonal contraceptives. In 10 healthy women, the \n\npharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single \n\ndose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 0.75 mg of ethinyl estradiol were studied. The \n\nresults were similar with and without co-administration of thalidomide 200 mg/day to steady-state \n\nlevels. However, combined hormonal contraceptives are not recommended due to the increased risk of \n\nvenous thromboembolic disease. \n\n \n\nWarfarin \n\nMultiple dose administration of 200 mg thalidomide q.d. for 4 days had no effect on the international \n\nnormalized ratio (INR) in healthy volunteers. However, due to the increased risk of thrombosis in \n\ncancer patients, and a potentially accelerated metabolism of warfarin with corticosteroids, close \n\nmonitoring of INR values is advised during thalidomide-prednisone combination treatment as well as \n\nduring the first weeks after ending these treatments. \n\n \n\nDigoxin \n\nThalidomide does not interact with digoxin. In 18 healthy male volunteers, multiple dose \n\nadministration of 200 mg thalidomide had no apparent effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of \n\ndigoxin. In addition, single dose administration of 0.5 mg digoxin had no apparent effect on \n\nthalidomide pharmacokinetics. It is not known whether the effect will be different in multiple \n\nmyeloma patients. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \n\nWomen of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for at least 4 weeks \n\nbefore start of treatment, during treatment including during dose interruptions, and until at least \n\n4 weeks after thalidomide treatment (see section 4.4). If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with \n\nthalidomide, treatment must be stopped immediately and the patient should be referred to a physician \n\nspecialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nAs thalidomide is found in semen, as a precaution all male patients must use condoms during \n\ntreatment, during dose interruption and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of treatment when \n\nhaving sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential who is \n\nnot using effective contraception. This applies even if the man has had a vasectomy. \n\nIf pregnancy occurs in a partner of a male patient taking thalidomide, the female partner should be \n\nreferred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential unless all the \n\nconditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met (see section 4.3) \n\n \n\nThalidomide is a powerful human teratogen, inducing a high frequency (about 30 %) of severe and \n\nlive-threatening birth defects such as: ectromelia (amelia, phocomelia, hemimelia) of the upper and/or \n\nlower extremities, microtia with abnormality of the external acoustic meatus (blind or absent), middle \n\nand internal ear lesions (less frequent), ocular lesions (anophthalmia, microphthalmia), congenital \n\nheart disease, renal abnormalities. Other less frequent abnormalities have also been described. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nIt is unknown whether thalidomide is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \n\nexcretion of thalidomide in breast milk. Therefore breast-feeding should be discontinued during \n\ntreatment with thalidomide. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nA study in rabbits demonstrated no effect on fertility indices in males or females although testicular \n\ndegeneration was observed in males. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nThalidomide Celgene as per the recommended posology has minor or moderate influence on the \n\nability to drive and use machines. \n\nThalidomide may cause fatigue (very common), dizziness (very common), somnolence (very \n\ncommon) and blurred vision (common) (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed not to drive \n\ncars, use machines or perform hazardous tasks while being treated with thalidomide if they feel tired, \n\ndizzy, sleepy or have blurred vison. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nMost patients taking thalidomide can be expected to experience adverse reactions. \n\nThe most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination \n\nwith melphalan and prednisone are: neutropenia, leukopenia, constipation, somnolence, paraesthesia, \n\nperipheral neuropathy, anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, dysaesthesia, tremor and \n\nperipheral oedema. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the adverse reactions outlined above, thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in \n\nother clinical studies led to the very common adverse reaction of fatigue; common adverse reactions of \n\ntransient ischaemic event, syncope, vertigo, hypotension, mood altered, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea \n\nand dyspepsia; and uncommon adverse reactions of cerebrovascular accident, diverticular perforation, \n\nperitonitis, orthostatic hypotension and bronchitis. \n\n \n\nThe most clinically important adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination \n\nwith melphalan and prednisone or dexamethasone include: deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary \n\nembolism, peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic \n\nepidermal necrolysis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, syncope, \n\nbradycardia, and dizziness (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nTable 3 contains only the adverse reactions for which a causal relationship with medicinal product \n\ntreatment could reasonably be established observed in the pivotal study and from post-marketing \n\nexperience. Frequencies given are based on the observations during a pivotal comparative clinical \n\nstudy investigating the effect of thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone in \n\npreviously untreated multiple myeloma patients.  \n\n \n\nFrequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon \n\n(≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in \n\norder of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nTable 3: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in pivotal clinical study with thalidomide in \n\ncombination with melphalan and prednisone and from post marketing use  \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations Common Pneumonia \n\n\n\n 12 \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reaction \n\nNot Known \n\nSevere infections (e.g. fatal sepsis including septic \n\nshock)†,  \n\nViral infections, including herpes zoster and \n\nhepatitis B virus reactivation† \n\nNeoplasms benign, \n\nmalignant and unspecified \n\n(incl cysts and polyps) \n\nCommon Acute myeloid leukaemia*,^ \n\nUncommon Myelodysplastic syndrome*,^ \n\nNot Known Tumour lysis syndrome† \n\nBlood and lymphatic \n\nsystem disorders \n\nVery Common \nNeutropenia, Leukopenia, Anaemia, \n\nLymphopenia, Thrombocytopenia \n\nCommon Febrile neutropenia†, Pancytopenia† \n\nImmune System Disorders Not Known \nAllergic reactions (hypersensitivity, angioedema, \n\nanaphylactic reaction, urticaria) † \n\nEndocrine Disorders Not Known Hypothyroidism† \n\nPsychiatric disorders Common Confusional state, Depression \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nVery Common \nPeripheral neuropathy*, Tremor, Dizziness, \n\nParaesthesia, Dysaesthesia, Somnolence \n\nCommon Convulsions†, Abnormal coordination  \n\nNot Known \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n\n(PRES)*,†, Worsening of Parkinson’s disease \n\nsymptoms† \n\nEar and labyrinth \n\ndisorders \nCommon Hearing impaired or deafness† \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nCommon Cardiac failure, Bradycardia \n\nUncommon \nMyocardial infarction†, Atrial fibrillation†, \n\nAtrioventricular block† \n\nVascular disorders Common  Deep vein thrombosis* \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \n\nmediastinal disorders \n\nCommon \nPulmonary embolism*, Interstitial lung disease, \n\nBronchopneumopathy, Dyspnea \n\nNot Known Pulmonary hypertension† \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nVery Common Constipation \n\nCommon Vomiting, Dry mouth \n\nUncommon Intestinal obstruction† \n\nNot Known \nGastrointestinal perforation†, Pancreatitis†, \n\nGastrointestinal haemorrhage† \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Not Known Hepatic disorders†  \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\nCommon  Toxic skin eruption, Rash, Dry skin \n\nNot Known \n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome*,†, Toxic epidermal \n\nnecrolysis*,†, Drug reaction with eosinophilia and \n\nsystemic symptoms*,†, Leukocytoclastic \n\nvasculitis† \n\nRenal and urinary \n\ndisorders \nCommon Renal failure† \n\nReproductive System and \n\nBreast Disorders \nNot Known \n\nSexual dysfunction†, Menstrual disorders \n\nincluding amenorrhea† \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nVery Common  Peripheral oedema \n\nCommon  Pyrexia, Asthenia, Malaise \n\n* see section 4.8 description of selected adverse reactions \n† identified from post marketing data \n\n^ Acute myeloid leukaemia and Myelodysplastic syndrome were reported in one clinical study in patients with previously untreated MM \n\nreceiving the combination of melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) \n\n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nAdverse reactions for haematological disorders are provided compared to the comparator arm, as the \n\ncomparator has a significant effect on these disorders (Table 4). \n\n \n\nTable 4: Comparison of haematological disorders for the melphalan, prednisone (MP) and \n\nmelphalan, prednisone, thalidomide (MPT) combinations in study IFM 99-06 (see section 5.1) \n\n n (% of patients) \n\n MP (n=193) MPT (n=124) \n\n Grades 3 and 4* \n\nNeutropenia 57 (29.5)  53 (42.7)  \n\nLeukopenia 32 (16.6)  32 (25.8) \n\nAnaemia 28 (14.5)  17 (13.7) \n\nLymphopenia 14 (7.3)  15 (12.1)  \n\nThrombocytopenia 19 (9.8)  14 (11.3) \n* WHO Criteria \n\n \n\nAdditional adverse reactions from post-marketing experience with thalidomide and not seen in the \n\npivotal study include febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia. \n\n \n\nTeratogenicity \n\nThe risk of intra-uterine death or severe birth defects, primarily phocomelia, is extremely high. \n\nThalidomide must not be used at any time during pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n\n \n\nVenous and arterial thromboembolic events \n\nAn increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary \n\nembolism) and arterial thromboembolism (such as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular event) \n\nhas been reported in patients treated with thalidomide (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPeripheral neuropathy \n\nPeripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction of treatment with \n\nthalidomide that may result in irreversible damage (see section 4.4). Peripheral neuropathy generally \n\noccurs following chronic use over a period of months. However, reports following relatively short-\n\nterm use also exist. Incidence of neuropathy events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or \n\ninterruption increases with cumulative dose and duration of therapy. Symptoms may occur some time \n\nafter thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all. \n\n \n\nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/ Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy \n\nsyndrome (RPLS) \n\nCases of PRES/RPLS have been reported. Signs and symptoms included visual disturbance, headache, \n\nseizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of \n\nPRES/RPLS requires confirmation by brain imaging. The majority of the reported cases had \n\nrecognized risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including hypertension, renal impairment and concomitant \n\nuse of high dose corticosteroids and/or chemotherapy. \n\n \n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) \n\nAML and MDS were reported in one clinical study in patients with previously untreated multiple \n\nmyeloma receiving the combination of melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions and severe skin reactions \n\nCases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous \n\nreactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of \n\nthalidomide therapy. If angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN or \n\nDRESS is suspected, use of thalidomide should not be resumed (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nElderly population \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nThe adverse reaction profile reported in patients > 75 years of age treated with thalidomide 100 mg \n\nonce daily was similar to the adverse reaction profile observed in patients ≤ 75 years of age treated \n\nwith thalidomide 200 mg once daily (see Table 3). However, patients with age > 75 years are \npotentially at risk for a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nEighteen cases of overdose have been reported in the literature concerning doses up to 14.4 grams. In \n\nthirteen of these cases, patients took thalidomide alone; amounts ranged from 350 mg to 4000 mg. \n\nThese patients either exhibited no symptoms or exhibited symptoms of drowsiness, irritability, \n\n“sickness,” and/or headache. In one 2-year-old child who took 700 mg, there was an abnormal plantar \n\nresponse in addition to drowsiness and irritability. No fatalities have been reported and all overdose \npatients recovered without sequelae. There is no specific antidote for a thalidomide overdose. In the \n\nevent of an overdose, the patient’s vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care \n\ngiven to maintain blood pressure and respiratory status. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX02. \n\n \n\nThalidomide has a chiral centre and is used clinically as a racemate of (+)-(R)- and \n\n(-)-(S)-thalidomide. The spectrum of activity of thalidomide is not fully characterised. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nThalidomide shows immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-neoplastic activities. \n\nData from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory \n\nand anti-neoplastic effects of thalidomide may be related to suppression of excessive tumour necrosis \n\nfactor-alpha (TNF-) production, down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules \n\ninvolved in leukocyte migration and anti-angiogenic activity. Thalidomide is also a non-barbiturate \n\ncentrally active hypnotic sedative. It has no antibacterial effects. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nResults from IFM 99-06, a Phase 3, randomised, open label, parallel group, multicentre study have \n\ndemonstrated a survival advantage when thalidomide is used in combination with melphalan and \n\nprednisone for 12 cycles of 6 weeks in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. In \n\nthis study the age range of patients was 65-75 years, with 41 % (183/447) of patients 70 years old or \n\nolder. The median dose of thalidomide was 217 mg and > 40 % of patients received 9 cycles. \n\nMelphalan and prednisone were dosed at 0.25 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day respectively on days 1 to 4 \n\nof each 6 weeks cycle. \n\n \n\nFurther to the per protocol analysis, an update was conducted for the IFM 99-06 study providing an \n\nadditional 15 months follow-up data. The median overall survival (OS) was 51.6 ± 4.5 and \n\n33.2 ± 3.2 months in the MPT and MP groups, respectively (97.5 % CI 0.42 to 0.84). This 18 month \n\ndifference was statistically significant with a hazard ratio of reduction of risk of death in the MPT arm \n\nof 0.59, 97.5 % confidence interval of 0.42-0.84 and p-value of < 0.001 (see Figure 1). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 15 \n\nFigure 1: Overall survival according to treatment \n\n \n \n\nPaediatric Population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nthalidomide in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma (see section 4.2 for \n\ninformation on paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAbsorption of thalidomide is slow after oral administration. The maximum plasma concentrations are \n\nreached 1-5 hours after administration. Co-administration of food delayed absorption but did not alter \n\nthe overall extent of absorption. \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe plasma protein binding of the (+)-(R) and (-)-(S) enantiomers was found to be 55 % and 65 % \n\nrespectively. Thalidomide is present in the semen of male patients at levels similar to plasma \n\nconcentrations (see section 4.4). The distribution of thalidomide is not influenced by age, gender, renal \n\nfunction and blood chemistry variables, to any significant level. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nThalidomide is metabolised almost exclusively by non-enzymatic hydrolysis. In plasma, unchanged \n\nthalidomide represents 80 % of the circulatory components. Unchanged thalidomide was a minor \n\ncomponent (< 3 % of the dose) in urine. In addition to thalidomide, hydrolytic products \n\nN-(o-carboxybenzoyl) glutarimide and phthaloyl isoglutamine formed via non-enzymatic processes \n\nare also present in plasma and in majority in urine. Oxidative metabolism does not contribute \n\nsignificantly to the overall metabolism of thalidomide. There is minimal cytochrome P450 catalysed \n\nhepatic metabolism of thalidomide. There are in vitro data indicating that prednisone may give rise to \n\nenzyme induction which could reduce the systemic exposure of concomitantly used medicinal \n\nproducts. The in vivo relevance of these findings is unknown. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nThe mean elimination half-life of thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses between 50 mg \n\nand 400 mg was 5.5 to 7.3 hours. Following a single oral dose of 400 mg of radio-labelled \n\n0 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\n1 \n\n0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 \n\nTime from randomization ( month ) \n\n51.6 ± 4.5 62/125 MP - T \n33.2 ± 3.2 128/196 MP \n\nSurvival time \nmedian ± se (month) \n\nO/N + Treatment \n\nProportion  \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nthalidomide, the total mean recovery was 93.6 % of the administered dose by day 8. The majority of \n\nthe radioactive dose was excreted within 48 hour following dose administration. The major route of \n\nexcretion was via the urine (> 90 %) while faecal excretion was minor. \n\n \n\nThere is a linear relationship between body weight and estimated thalidomide clearance; in multiple \n\nmyeloma patients with body weight from 47-133 kg, thalidomide clearance ranged from \n\napproximately 6-12 L/h, representing an increase in thalidomide clearance of 0.621 L/h per 10 kg body \n\nweight increase. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\nTotal systemic exposure (AUC) is proportional to dose at single-dose conditions. No time dependency \n\nof the pharmacokinetics has been observed. \n\n \n\nHepatic and renal impairment \n\nThe extent of thalidomide metabolism by the liver cytochrome P450 system is minimal and intact \n\nthalidomide is not excreted by the kidney. Measures of renal function (CrCl) and liver function (blood \n\nchemistry) indicate minimal effect of kidney and liver function on the pharmacokinetics of \n\nthalidomide. As such the metabolism of thalidomide is not expected to be affected by hepatic or renal \n\ndysfunction. Data from patients with end-stage renal disease suggest no impact of kidney function on \n\nthalidomide pharmacokinetics.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nIn the male dog, after one year of dosing, reversible bile plugs in canaliculi were observed at \n\nexposures greater than 1.9-fold the human exposure. \n\n \n\nDecreased platelet counts were noted in the mouse and rat studies. The latter appears to be related to \n\nthalidomide and occurred at exposures greater than 2.4-fold the human exposure. This decrease did not \n\nresult in clinical signs. \n\n \n\nIn a one-year dog study, enlarged and/or blue discoloration of mammary glands and prolonged estrus \n\nwere observed in females at exposures equal to 1.8 or greater than 3.6-fold the human exposure, \n\nrespectively. The relevance to humans is unknown. \n\n \n\nThe effect of thalidomide on thyroid function was assessed in both rats and dogs. No effects were \n\nobserved in dogs; however in rats, there was an apparent dose-dependent decrease in total and free T4 \n\nthat was more consistent in the female. \n\n \n\nNo mutagenic or genotoxic effect has been revealed when thalidomide was assayed in a standard \n\nbattery of genotoxicity tests. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed at exposures approximately \n\n15, 13 and 39 times the estimated clinical AUC at the recommended starting dose in mice, male rats \n\nand female rats respectively. \n\n \n\nAnimal studies have demonstrated differences in species susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of \n\nthalidomide. In humans, thalidomide is a proven teratogen. \n\n \n\nA study in rabbits demonstrated no effect on fertility indices in males or females although testicular \n\ndegeneration was observed in males. \n\n \n\nA peri- and postnatal toxicity study performed in rabbits with thalidomide administered at doses up to \n\n500 mg/kg/day resulted in abortions, increased stillbirths and decreased pup viability during lactation. \n\nPups from mothers treated with thalidomide had increased abortions, reduced body weight gain, \n\nalterations in learning and memory, decreased fertility, and reduced pregnancy index. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 17 \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Thalidomide Celgene is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nWhat Thalidomide Celgene is \n\nThalidomide Celgene contains an active substance called thalidomide. This belongs to a group of \n\nmedicines which affect how your immune system works. \n\n \n\nWhat Thalidomide Celgene is used for \n\nThalidomide Celgene is used with two other medicines called ‘melphalan’ and ‘prednisone’ to treat \n\nadults with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma. It is used in people who have recently been \n\ndiagnosed and who have not been prescribed another medicine for their multiple myeloma before who \n\nare aged 65 years and over, or aged less than 65 years who cannot be treated with high dose \n\nchemotherapy, which can be very difficult for the body to handle. \n\n \n\nWhat is multiple myeloma \n\nMultiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain type of white blood cell, called the \n\nplasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide out of control. This can damage the \n\nbone and kidneys. Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms \n\ncan be greatly reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘remission’. \n\n \n\nHow Thalidomide Celgene works \n\nThalidomide Celgene works by helping the body’s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It \n\nworks in a number of different ways: \n\n• by stopping the cancer cells developing \n\n• by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer \n\n• by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Thalidomide Celgene \n\n \n\nYou will have been given specific instructions by your doctor, particularly on the effects of \n\nthalidomide on unborn babies (outlined in the Thalidomide Celgene Pregnancy Prevention \n\nProgramme). \n\n \n\nYou will have been given an educational brochure for patient by your doctor. Read it carefully and \n\nfollow the related instructions. \n\n \n\nIf you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before \n\nyou take thalidomide. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and precautions” \n\nand “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. \n\n \n\nDo not take Thalidomide Celgene \n\n• if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as \nThalidomide Celgene causes birth defects and foetal death. \n\n• if you are able to become pregnant, unless you are able to follow or comply with the required \ncontraceptive measures to prevent you from becoming pregnant (see section 2 “Warnings and \n\nprecautions” and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”). \n\n• if you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription that the \nnecessary measures have been taken and will provide you with this confirmation. \n\n• if you are allergic to thalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section \n6 “Contents of the pack and other information”. \n\n \n\nDo not take Thalidomide Celgene if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your \n\ndoctor or pharmacist before taking Thalidomide Celgene. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine in the following situations: \n\n \n\nFor women taking Thalidomide Celgene \n\nBefore starting the treatment, you should ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if \n\nyou think this is unlikely. Even if you do not have a menstrual bleeding following cancer therapy, you \n\nmay become pregnant. \n\nIf you are able to become pregnant: \n\n• Your doctor will make sure that you have pregnancy tests \no before treatment \no every 4 weeks during treatment \no 4 weeks after stopping treatment \n\n• You must use one effective method of contraception: \no for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment  \no during treatment \no until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment \n\nYour doctor will tell you what method of contraception to use. \n\n \n\nIf you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record with each prescription that the necessary \n\nmeasures, as outlined above, have been taken  \n\n \n\nFor men taking Thalidomide Celgene \n\nThalidomide passes into semen. Therefore, do not have unprotected intercourse, even if you had a \n\nvasectomy. \n\n• Pregnancy and any exposure during pregnancy must be avoided. Always use a condom: \no during treatment  \no for at least 7 days after stopping treatment \n\n• You must not donate semen:  \no during treatment  \no for  at least 7 days after stopping treatment \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n \n\nFor all patients \n\nTalk to your doctor before taking Thalidomide Celgene if \n\n• you do not understand the contraception advice given to you by your doctor or if you do not feel \nable to follow this advice. \n\n• you have had a heart attack, have ever had a blood clot in the past, or if you smoke, have high \nblood pressure or high cholesterol levels. During the treatment with Thalidomide Celgene you \n\nhave an increased risk of developing blood clots in the veins and arteries (see also section 4 \n\n“Possible side effects”).   \n\n• you have experienced or have existing neuropathy i.e. nerve damage causing tingling, abnormal \nco-ordination or pain in your hands or feet (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”).    \n\n• you experienced or have existing slow heart rate (this may be a symptom of bradycardia). \n\n• you have high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (see also section 4 “Possible side \neffects”). \n\n• you have a fall in the number of white blood cells (neutropenia) accompanied by fever and \ninfection. \n\n• you have a fall in the number of platelets. You will be more prone to bleeding and bruising. \n\n• you have or have had injury to the liver (hepatic disorders) including abnormal liver test results.  \n\n• you experience or have experienced in the past severe skin reactions called Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms \n\n(which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity syndrome). (For description of \n\nsymptoms see section 4 “Possible side effects”).  \n\n• you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking Thalidomide Celgene such as rash, itching, \nswelling, dizziness or trouble breathing. \n\n• you have experienced sleepiness.  \n\n• you have experienced fever, chills and severe shaking, and possibly complicated by low blood \npressure and confusion (these may be symptoms of severe infections).  \n\n• you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly varicella zoster, hepatitis B \ninfection, or HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with Thalidomide Celgene \n\nmay cause a virus to become active again in patients who carry it, resulting in a recurrence of the \n\ninfection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection. \n\n• you have kidney or liver problems (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”).  \n \n\nYour doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your \n\nbone marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels \n\nof chemicals in the body which can lead to kidneys failure (this condition is called Tumour Lysis \n\nSyndrome) (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n \n\nYour doctor should evaluate if you develop additional types of haematological malignancies (called \n\nacute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) during your treatment with Thalidomide \n\nCelgene (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). \n\n \n\nYou must not donate blood during Thalidomide Celgene treatment and for at least 7 days after \n\nstopping treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Thalidomide \n\nCelgene. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThalidomide Celgene is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Thalidomide Celgene \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This \n\nincludes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. \n\n \n\nMake sure you tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines which: \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n• cause sleepiness as thalidomide may increase their effects. This includes sedatives (such as \nanxiolytics, hypnotics, antipsychotics, H1 antihistamines, opiate derivatives and barbiturates). \n\n• slow the heart rate (induce bradycardia, such as anticholinesterases and beta blockers).  \n\n• are used for heart problems and complications (such as digoxin), or for thinning the blood (such \nas warfarin). \n\n• are associated with neuropathy such as other treatments for cancer. \n\n• are used for contraception. \n \n\nThalidomide Celgene with food, drink and alcohol \n\nDo not drink alcohol while you are taking Thalidomide Celgene. This is because alcohol can make you \n\nsleepy and Thalidomide Celgene can make you even sleepier. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThalidomide causes severe birth defects or death to an unborn baby. \n\n• As little as one capsule taken by a pregnant woman can cause a baby to have serious birth \ndefects. \n\n• These defects can include shortened arms or legs, malformed hands or feet, eye or ear defects, \nand problems with internal organs. \n\nIf you are pregnant, you must not take Thalidomide Celgene. In addition, you must not become \n\npregnant while taking Thalidomide Celgene. \n\n \n\nYou must use one effective method of contraception if you are a woman who is able to become \n\npregnant (see section 2, “What you need to know before you take Thalidomide Celgene”). \n\n \n\nYou must stop treatment and inform your doctor straight away if: \n\n• You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect \nyou are pregnant. \n\n• You have heterosexual intercourse without using an effective method of contraception. \nIf you do become pregnant during the treatment with thalidomide, you must stop the treatment and \n\ninform your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nFor men taking Thalidomide Celgene who have a female partner who is able to become pregnant, \n\nplease see section 2 “What you need to know before you take Thalidomide Celgene”. If your partner \n\nbecomes pregnant whilst you are taking thalidomide, you should inform your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nDo not breastfeed when taking Thalidomide Celgene as it is not known if thalidomide is passed into \n\nhuman breast milk. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDo not drive or use any tools or machines if you experience side effects, such as dizziness, tiredness, \n\nsleepiness or blurred vision. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Thalidomide Celgene \n\n \n\nAlways take Thalidomide Celgene exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you to. Check with \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nHow much to take \n\nThe recommended dose is 200 mg (4 x 50 mg capsules) a day for adults aged 75 years and under or \n\n100 mg (2 x 50 mg capsules) a day for adults aged over 75 years. However your doctor will choose the \n\n\n\n 36 \n\ndose for you, monitor your progress and may adjust your dose. Your doctor will tell you how to take \n\nThalidomide Celgene and for how long you will need to take it (see section 2, “What you need to \n\nknow before you take Thalidomide Celgene”). \n\n \n\nThalidomide Celgene is taken daily in treatment cycles, each cycle lasting 6 weeks, in combination \n\nwith melphalan and prednisone which are taken on days 1 to 4 of each 6 week cycle. \n\n \n\nTaking this medicine \n\n• Do not break, open or chew the capsules. If powder from a broken Thalidomide Celgene capsule \nmakes contact with the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. \n\n• Healthcare professionals, caregivers and family members should wear disposable gloves when \nhandling the blister or capsule. Gloves should then be removed carefully to prevent skin \n\nexposure, placed in a sealable plastic polyethylene bag and disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. Hands should then be washed thoroughly with soap and water. Women who are \n\npregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or capsule. \n\n• Take this medicine by mouth. \n\n• Swallow the capsules whole with a full glass of water. \n\n• Do not crush or chew. \n\n• Take the capsules as a single dose before going to bed. This will make you less likely to feel \nsleepy at other times. \n\n \n\nTo remove the capsule from the blister, press only one end of the capsule out to push it through the \n\nfoil. Do not apply pressure on the centre of the capsule as this can cause it to break. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nIf you take more Thalidomide Celgene than you should \n\nIf you take more Thalidomide Celgene than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital \n\nstraightaway.
