NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nAVAMYS 27.5 micrograms/spray, nasal spray suspension \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nEach spray actuation delivers 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nNasal spray, suspension. \n\n \n\nWhite suspension. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nAvamys is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 years and over) \n\n \n\nAvamys is indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and over) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is two spray actuations (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray \n\nactuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms). \n\n \n\nOnce adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril \n\n(total daily dose 55 micrograms) may be effective for maintenance. \n\nThe dose should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. \n\n \n\nChildren (6 to 11 years of age) \n\nThe recommended starting dose is one spray actuation (27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray \n\nactuation) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms). \n\n \n\nPatients not adequately responding to one spray actuation in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 55 \n\nmicrograms) may use two spray actuations in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 110 micrograms). \n\nOnce adequate control of symptoms is achieved, dose reduction to one spray actuation in each nostril once \n\ndaily (total daily dose, 55 micrograms) is recommended. \n\n \n\nFor full therapeutic benefit regular, scheduled usage is recommended. Onset of action has been observed \n\nas early as 8 hours after initial administration. However, it may take several days of treatment to achieve \n\nmaximum benefit, and the patient should be informed that their symptoms will improve with continuous \n\nregular use (see section 5.1). The duration of treatment should be restricted to the period that corresponds \n\nto allergenic exposure. \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nChildren under 6 years of age \n\nThe safety and efficacy of Avamys in children under the age of 6 years has not been established. Currently \n\navailable data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \n\n \n\nElderly Patients \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nRenal Impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in this population (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nHepatic Impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nAvamys nasal spray is for administration by the intranasal route only. \n\nThe intranasal device should be shaken before use. The device is primed by pressing the mist release \n\nbutton for at least six spray actuations (until a fine mist is seen), whilst holding the device upright. Re-\n\npriming (approximately 6 sprays until a fine mist is seen) is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 days \n\nor the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more. \n\nThe device should be cleaned after each use and the cap replaced. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nSystemic corticosteroid effects \n\nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroid may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged \n\nperiods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids and may vary in \n\nindividual patients and between different corticosteroid preparations. Potential systemic effects may \n\ninclude Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and \n\nadolescents, cataract, glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including \n\npsychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). \n\nTreatment with higher than recommended doses of nasal corticosteroids may result in clinically significant \n\nadrenal suppression. If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used, then additional \n\nsystemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery. \n\nFluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily was not associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \n\n(HPA) axis suppression in adult, adolescent or paediatric subjects. However the dose of intranasal \n\nfluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the symptoms of \n\nrhinitis is maintained. As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of corticosteroids \n\nshould be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently. \n\n \n\nIf there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired, care must be taken when transferring \n\npatients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate. \n\n \n\nVisual disturbance  \n\nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with \n\nsymptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral \n\nto an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare \n\n\n\n 4 \n\ndiseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic \n\nand topical corticosteroids. \n\n \n\nGrowth retardation \n\nGrowth retardation has been reported in children receiving nasal corticosteroids at licensed doses. A \n\nreduction in growth velocity has been observed in children treated with fluticasone furoate 110 \n\nmicrograms daily for one year (see section 4.8 and section 5.1). Therefore, children should be maintained \n\non the lowest possible efficacious dose which delivers adequate symptom control (see section 4.2). It is \n\nrecommended that the growth of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal corticosteroids is \n\nregularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of \n\nnasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained. \n\nIn addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric specialist (see section \n\n5.1). \n\n \n\nPatients on ritonavir \n\nConcomitant administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic \n\nexposure of fluticasone furoate (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nInteraction with CYP3A inhibitors \n\nFluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared by extensive first pass metabolism mediated by the cytochrome \n\nP450 3A4. \n\n \n\nBased on data with another glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), that is metabolised by CYP3A4, \n\ncoadministration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of \n\nfluticasone furoate. \n\n \n\nCaution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A inhibitors \n\nincluding cobicistat-containing products as an increase in the risk of systemic side effects is expected. Co-\n\nadministration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid \n\nside effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects. In a drug \n\ninteraction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there \n\nwere more subjects with measurable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the \n\n20 subjects) compared to placebo (1 out of 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a \n\nstatistically significant difference in 24 hour serum cortisol levels between the two groups. \n\n \n\nThe enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating \n\nmetabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of \n\nother compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses. Therefore, no clinical studies have been conducted \n\nto investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nThere are no adequate data from the use of fluticasone furoate in pregnant women. In animal studies \n\nglucocorticoids have been shown to induce malformations including cleft palate and intra-uterine growth \n\nretardation. This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which results in \n\nminimal systemic exposure (see section 5.2). Fluticasone furoate should be used in pregnancy only if the \n\nbenefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the foetus or child. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether nasal administered fluticasone furoate is excreted in human breast milk. \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nAdministration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the \n\nexpected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nThere are no fertility data in humans. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nAvamys has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment with fluticasone furoate are epistaxis, \n\nnasal ulceration and headache.  The most serious undesirable effects are rare reports of hypersensitivity \n\nreactions, including anaphylaxis (less than 1 case per 1000 patients). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThere were over 2700 patients treated with fluticasone furoate in safety and efficacy studies for seasonal \n\nand perennial allergic rhinitis. Paediatric exposure to fluticasone furoate in safety and efficacy studies in \n\nseasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis included 243 patients 12 to <18 years, 790 patients 6 to <12 years \n\nand 241 patients 2 to <6 years. \n\n \n\nData from large clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions. \n\nThe following convention has been used for the classification of frequencies: Very common ≥1/10; \n\nCommon ≥1/100 to <1/10; Uncommon ≥1/1000 to <1/100; Rare ≥1/10,000 to <1/1000; Very rare \n\n<1/10,000; Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nRare Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and \n\nurticaria. \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon Headache. \n\nEye disorders \n\nNot known Transient ocular changes (see Clinical experience), vision blurred (see also \n\nsection 4.4) \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nVery common *Epistaxis \n\nCommon Nasal ulceration, dyspnoea** \n\nUncommon Rhinalgia, nasal discomfort (including nasal burning, nasal irritation, and \n\nnasal soreness), nasal dryness. \n\nVery rare Nasal septum perforation \n\nNot known Bronchospasm \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (Children) \n\nNot known ***Growth retardation (see Clinical experience). \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nEpistaxis \n\n*Epistaxis was generally mild to moderate in intensity. In adults and adolescents, the incidence of \n\nepistaxis was higher in longer-term use (more than 6 weeks) than in short-term use (up to 6 weeks). \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nSystemic effects \n\nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroids may occur, particularly when prescribed at high doses for \n\nprolonged periods (see section 4.4). Growth retardation has been reported in children receiving nasal \n\ncorticosteroids. \n\n \n\n**Dyspnoea cases were reported in more than 1% of patients during clinical trials with fluticasone \n\nfuroate; similar rates were also observed in placebo groups. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety in children under 6 years has not been well established.  Frequency, type and severity of \n\nadverse reactions observed in the paediatric population are similar to those in the adult population.   \n\n \n\nEpistaxis \n\n*In paediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between \n\npatients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo.   \n\n \n\nGrowth retardation \n\n***In a one-year clinical study assessing growth in pre-pubescent children receiving 110 micrograms of \n\nfluticasone furoate once daily, an average treatment difference of -0.27 cm per year in growth velocity \n\nwas observed compared to placebo (see Clinical efficacy and safety). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \n\ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \n\nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn a bioavailability study, intranasal doses of up to 2640 micrograms per day were administered over three \n\ndays with no adverse systemic reactions observed (see section 5.2). \n\nAcute overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nMechanism of action: \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Nasal preparations, corticosteroids. ATC code: R01AD12 \n\n \n\nFluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the \n\nglucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety: \n\nSeasonal Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents \n\nCompared with placebo, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved \n\nnasal symptoms (comprising rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and ocular \n\nsymptoms (comprising itching/burning, tearing/watering and redness of the eyes) in all 4 studies. Efficacy \n\nwas maintained over the full 24-hours dosing period with once daily administration. \n\n \n\nOnset of therapeutic benefit was observed as early as 8 hours after initial administration, with further \n\nimprovement observed for several days afterwards. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 7 \n\nFluticasone furoate nasal spray significantly improved the patients’ perception of overall response to \n\ntherapy, and the patients’ disease-related quality of life (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire \n\n– RQLQ), in all 4 studies. \n\n \n\nPerennial Allergic Rhinitis in adults and adolescents: \n\nFluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved nasal symptoms as well \n\nas patients’ perception of overall response to therapy compared to placebo in three studies. \n\nFluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily significantly improved ocular symptoms as \n\nwell as improving patients’ disease-related quality of life (RQLQ) compared to placebo in one study. \n\nEfficacy was maintained over the full 24-hour dosing period with once daily administration. \n\n \n\nIn a two-year study designed to assess the ocular safety of fluticasone furoate (110 micrograms once daily \n\nintranasal spray), adults and adolescents with perennial allergic rhinitis received either fluticasone furoate \n\n(n=367) or placebo (n=181). The primary outcomes [time to increase in posterior subcapsular opacity \n\n(0.3 from baseline in Lens Opacities Classification System, Version III (LOCS III grade)) and time to \n\nincrease in intraocular pressure (IOP; 7 mmHg from baseline)] were not statistically significant between \n\nthe two groups. Increases in posterior subscapsular opacity (0.3 from baseline) were more frequent in \n\nsubjects treated with fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms [14 (4%)] versus placebo [4 (2%)] and were \n\ntransient in nature for ten subjects in the fluticasone furoate group and two subjects in the placebo group. \n\nIncreases in IOP (7 mmHg from baseline) were more frequent in subjects treated with fluticasone furoate \n\n110 micrograms: 7 (2%) for fluticasone furoate 110 micrograms once daily and 1 (<1%) for placebo. \n\nThese events were transient in nature for six subjects in the fluticasone furoate group and one placebo \n\nsubject. At weeks 52 and 104, 95% of subjects in both treatment groups had posterior subcapsular opacity \n\nvalues within ± 0.1 of baseline values for each eye and, at week 104, ≤1% of subjects in both treatment \n\ngroups had 0.3 increase from baseline in posterior subcapsular opacity.  At weeks 52 and 104, the \n\nmajority of subjects (>95%) had IOP values of within ± 5mmHg of the baseline value.  Increases in \n\nposterior subcapsular opacity or IOP were not accompanied by any adverse events of cataracts or \n\nglaucoma. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population: \n\nSeasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children: \n\nThe paediatric posology is based on assessment of the efficacy data across the allergic rhinitis population \n\nin children. \n\nIn seasonal allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily was effective but \n\nno significant differences were observed between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once \n\ndaily and placebo on any endpoint. \n\nIn perennial allergic rhinitis, fluticasone furoate nasal spray 55 micrograms once daily exhibited a more \n\nconsistent efficacy profile than fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily over 4 weeks’ \n\ntreatment. Post-hoc analysis over 6 and 12 weeks in the same study, as well as 6-week HPA axis safety \n\nstudy, supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily. \n\nA 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms once daily on \n\nadrenal function in children aged 2 to 11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24-hour \n\nserum cortisol profiles, compared with placebo. \n\n \n\nA randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, one-year placebo-controlled clinical growth \n\nstudy evaluated the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 micrograms daily on growth velocity in \n\n474 prepubescent children (5 to 7.5 years of age for girls and 5 to 8.5 years of age for boys) with \n\nstadiometry. Mean growth velocity over the 52-week treatment period was lower in the patients receiving \n\nfluticasone furoate (5.19 cm/year) compared to placebo (5.46 cm/year). The mean treatment difference \n\nwas -0.27 cm per year [95% CI -0.48 to -0.06]. \n\n \n\nSeasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in children (under 6 years): \n\n\n\n 8 \n\nSafety and efficacy studies were performed in a total of 271 patients from 2 to 5 years of age in both \n\nseasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, of whom 176 were exposed to fluticasone furoate. \n\nSafety and efficacy in this group has not been well established. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nFluticasone furoate undergoes incomplete absorption and extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and \n\ngut resulting in negligible systemic exposure. The intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily does \n\nnot typically result in measurable plasma concentrations (<10 pg/ml). The absolute bioavailability for \n\nintranasal fluticasone furoate is 0.50 %, such that less than 1 microgram of fluticasone furoate would be \n\nsystemically available after administration of 110 micrograms (see section 4.9). \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nThe plasma protein binding of fluticasone furoate is greater than 99 %. Fluticasone furoate is widely \n\ndistributed with volume of distribution at steady-state of, on average, 608 l. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nFluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 l/h) from systemic circulation \n\nprincipally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17β-carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X), by the \n\ncytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S-\n\nfluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the 17β-carboxylic acid metabolite. In vivo studies have \n\nrevealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nElimination was primarily via the faecal route following oral and intravenous administration indicative of \n\nexcretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile. Following intravenous administration, the \n\nelimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hours. Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 1 % and 2 \n\n% of the orally and intravenously administered dose, respectively. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nIn the majority of patients fluticasone furoate is not quantifiable (< 10 pg/ml) following intranasal dosing \n\nof 110 micrograms once daily. Quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1 % of paediatric patients \n\nfollowing intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8 % of paediatric patients following \n\n55 micrograms once daily. There was no evidence for higher quantifiable levels of fluticasone furoate in \n\nyounger children (less than 6 years of age). Median fluticasone furoate concentrations in those subjects \n\nwith quantifiable levels at 55 micrograms were 18.4 pg/ml and 18.9 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, \n\nrespectively. \n\nAt 110 micrograms, median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 14.3 pg/ml and \n\n14.4 pg/ml for 2-5 yrs and 6-11 yrs, respectively. The values are similar to those seen in adults (12+) \n\nwhere median concentrations in those subjects with quantifiable levels were 15.4 pg/ml and 21.8 pg/ml at \n\n55 micrograms and 110 micrograms, respectively. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nOnly a small number of elderly patients (≥ 65 years, n=23/872; 2.6 %) provided pharmacokinetic data. \n\nThere was no evidence for a higher incidence of patients with quantifiable fluticasone furoate \n\nconcentrations in the elderly, when compared with the younger patients. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nFluticasone furoate is not detectable in urine from healthy volunteers after intranasal dosing. Less than 1 \n\n% of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected to \n\naffect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate. \n\n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nThere are no data with intranasal fluticasone furoate in patients with hepatic impairment. Data are \n\navailable following inhaled administration of fluticasone furoate (as fluticasone furoate or fluticasone \n\nfuroate/vilanterol) to subjects with hepatic impairment that are also applicable for intranasal dosing.  A \n\nstudy of a single 400 microgram dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate \n\nhepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) resulted in increased Cmax (42 %) and AUC(0-∞) (172 %) and a \n\nmodest (on average 23 %) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects. Following \n\nrepeat dosing of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol for 7 days, there was an increase in \n\nfluticasone furoate systemic exposure (on average two-fold as measured by AUC(0–24)) in subjects with \n\nmoderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) compared with healthy subjects. The increase \n\nin fluticasone furoate systemic exposure in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (fluticasone \n\nfuroate/vilanterol 200/25 micrograms) was associated with an average 34% reduction in serum cortisol \n\ncompared with healthy subjects. There was no effect on serum cortisol in subjects with severe hepatic \n\nimpairment (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/12.5 micrograms). Based on these findings the average \n\npredicted exposure of 110 micrograms of intranasal fluticasone furoate in this patient population would \n\nnot be expected to result in suppression of cortisol.  \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nFindings in general toxicology studies were similar to those observed with other glucocorticoids and are \n\nassociated with exaggerated pharmacological activity. These findings are not likely to be relevant for \n\nhumans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure. No genotoxic \n\neffects of fluticasone furoate have been observed in conventional genotoxicity tests. Further, there were no \n\ntreatment-related increases in the incidence of tumours in two year inhalation studies in rats and mice. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\nStep-by-step guide to using the nasal spray \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Avamys is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nAvamys (fluticasone furoate) belongs to a group of medicines called glucocorticoids. Avamys works to \n\ndecrease inflammation caused by allergy (rhinitis) and therefore reduce symptoms of allergy. \n\n \n\n \n\nAvamys nasal spray is used to treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis including stuffy, runny or itchy nose, \n\nsneezing and watery, itchy or red eyes, in adults and children aged 6 years and over. \n\n \n\nAllergy symptoms can occur at specific times of the year and be caused by allergy to pollen from grass or \n\ntrees (hayfever), or they can occur all year round and be caused by allergy to animals, house-dust mites or \n\nmoulds to name some of the most common. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Avamys \n\n \n\nDo not use Avamys: \n\n• If you are allergic to fluticasone furoate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \nsection 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nDo not use in children under 6 years old. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nTaking Avamys: \n\n• may when taken for a long time cause children to grow more slowly. The doctor will check your \nchild’s height regularly, and make sure he or she is taking the lowest possible effective dose. \n\n \n\n• may cause eye conditions such as glaucoma (increase in pressure in the eye) or cataracts (clouding \nof the lens of the eye).  Tell your doctor if you had these conditions in the past, or if you notice \n\nblurred vision or other visual disturbances while you are taking Avamys.  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Avamys \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken, or might take any other \n\nmedicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. \n\nIt is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken any of the following \n\nmedicines: \n\n• steroid tablets or injected steroids \n\n• steroid creams \n\n• medicines for asthma \n\n• ritonavir or cobicistat, used to treat HIV \n\n• ketoconazole, used to treat fungal infections  \n \n\nYour doctor will assess whether you should take Avamys with these medicines. Your doctor may wish to \n\nmonitor you carefully if you are taking any of these medicines as they may increase the side effects of \n\nAvamys.  \n\n \n\nAvamys should not be used at the same time with other nasal sprays containing steroids. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or a planning to have a baby, ask your \n\ndoctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nDo not use Avamys if you are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, unless your doctor or \n\npharmacist tells you to. \n\n \n\nDo not use Avamys if you are breast feeding unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nAvamys is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nAvamys contains benzalkonium chloride \n\nIn some patients benzalkonium chloride can cause irritation in the inside of the nose. Tell your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you feel discomfort when using the spray. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Avamys \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Don’t exceed the \n\nrecommended dose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you’re not sure. \n\n \n\nWhen to use Avamys \n\n• Use once a day \n\n• Use at the same time each day. \nThis will treat your symptoms throughout the day and night. \n\n \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nHow long Avamys takes to work \n\nSome people will not feel the full effects until several days after first using Avamys. \n\nHowever, it is usually effective within 8 to 24 hours of use. \n\n \n\nHow much to use \n\nAdults and children 12 years and over \n\n• The usual starting dose is 2 sprays in each nostril once every day. \n\n• Once symptoms are controlled you may be able to decrease your dose to 1 spray in each nostril, \nonce every day. \n\n \n\nChildren 6 to 11 years \n\n• The usual starting dose is 1 spray in each nostril once a day.  \n\n• If symptoms are very bad your doctor may increase the dose to 2 sprays in each nostril once every \nday until the symptoms are under control. It may then be possible for the dose to be reduced to 1 \n\nspray in each nostril once every day. \n\nHow to use the nasal spray \n\nAvamys has virtually no taste or smell. It is sprayed into the nose as a fine mist. Be careful not to get any \n\nspray into your eyes. If you do, rinse your eyes with water. \n\n \n\nThere is a step-by-step guide to using the nasal spray after Section 6 of this leaflet. Follow the guide \n\ncarefully to get full benefit from using Avamys \n\n See Step-by-step guide to using the nasal spray, after Section 6. \n \n\n \n\nIf you use more Avamys than you should \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Avamys \n\nIf you miss a dose, take it when you remember. \n\n \n\nIf it is nearly the time for your next dose, wait until then. Do not take a double dose to make up for a \n\nforgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, or if you have any discomfort using the \n\nnasal spray ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions: get a doctor’s help straight away \n\n \n\nAllergic reactions to Avamys are rare and affect less than 1 person in 1,000. In a small number of people, \n\nallergic reactions can develop into a more serious, even life-threatening problem if not treated. Symptoms \n\ninclude: \n\n- becoming very wheezy, coughing or having difficulty with breathing \n\n- suddenly feeling weak or light-headed (which may lead to collapse or loss of consciousness) \n\n- swelling around the face \n\n- skin rashes or redness. \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nIn many cases, these symptoms will be signs of less serious side effects. But you must be aware that \n\nthey are potentially serious — so, if you notice any of these symptoms: \n\nContact a doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n• Nosebleeds (generally minor), particularly if you use Avamys for more than 6 weeks continuously. \n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n• Nasal ulceration – which may cause irritation or discomfort in your nose. You may also get streaks \nof blood when you blow your nose. \n\n• Headache. \n\n• Shortness of breath \n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n• Pain, burning, irritation, soreness or dryness in the inside of the nose. \n \n\nVery rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) \n\n• Small holes (perforations) in the ridge inside the nose that separates the nostrils. \n \n\nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n• Slowing of growth in children. \n\n• Blurred vision or temporary changes to vision with long term use. \n\n• Chest tightness causing difficulty in breathing. \n \n\nNasal corticosteroids can affect the normal production of hormones in your body, particularly if you use \n\nhigh doses for a long time. In children this side effect can cause them to grow more slowly than others.  \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How to store Avamys \n\n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nIt is best to store your Avamys nasal spray upright. Always keep the cap on. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and carton. The expiry date \n\nrefers to the last day of the month. Avamys nasal spray should be used within 2 months after first opening. \n\n \n\nDo not refrigerate or freeze. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw \n\naway medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n 24 \n\n6.

It will contain either \n\n30, 60 or 120 sprays, depending on the pack size that has been prescribed for you. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nThe window in the plastic casing lets you see how much Avamys is left in the bottle. You will be able to \n\nsee the liquid level for a new 30 or 60 spray bottle, but not in a new 120 spray bottle because the liquid \n\nlevel is above the window.  \n\nSix important things you need to know about using the nasal spray \n\n• Avamys comes in an amber glass bottle. If you need to check how much is left hold the nasal \nspray upright against a bright light. You will then be able to see the level through the window.   \n\n• When you first use the nasal spray you will need to shake it vigorously with the cap on for about \n10 seconds. This is important as Avamys is a thick suspension that becomes liquid when you shake \n\nit well - see picture b. It will only spray when it becomes liquid. \n\n \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n• The mist-release button must be pressed firmly all the way in, to release the mist through the \nnozzle - see picture c.  \n\n \n\n• If you have difficulty pressing the button with your thumb, you can use two hands – see picture d \n\n \n\n \n\n• Always keep the cap on the nasal spray when you are not using it. The cap keeps the dust out, \nseals in the pressure and stops the nozzle from blocking up. When the cap is in place the mist-\n\nrelease button cannot be pressed accidentally. \n\n• Never use a pin or anything sharp to clear the nozzle. It will damage the nasal spray \n\n \n\nPreparing the nasal spray for use \n\n \n\nYou must prepare the nasal spray: \n\n \n\n• before you use it for the first time \n\n• if you have left the cap off for 5 days or the intranasal device has not been used for 30 days or more. \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nPreparing the nasal spray helps to make sure you always get the full dose of medicine. Follow these steps: \n\n1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously with the cap on for about 10 seconds.   \n\n2 Remove the cap by squeezing firmly on the sides of the cap with your thumb and forefinger– see \n\npicture e.  \n\n \n\n3 Hold the nasal spray upright, then tilt and point the nozzle away from you.  \n\n4 Press the button firmly all the way in. Do this at least 6 times until it releases a fine mist of spray \n\ninto the air  – see picture f. \n\n \n\nThe nasal spray is now ready for use. \n\n \n\nUsing the nasal spray \n\n1 Shake the nasal spray vigorously.  \n\n2 Remove the cap.  \n\n3 Blow your nose to clear your nostrils, then tilt your head forward a little bit. \n\n4 Place the nozzle in one of your nostrils – see picture g.  Point the end of the nozzle slightly \noutwards, away from the centre ridge of your nose. This helps to get the medicine to the correct part \n\nof your nose. \n\n5 Press the button firmly all the way in, while you breathe in through your nose – see picture h.  \n\n\n\n 30 \n\n \n\n6 Take the nozzle out and breathe out through your mouth. \n\n7 If your dose is 2 sprays in each nostril repeat steps 4 to 6. \n\n8 Repeat steps 4 to 7 to treat the other nostril. \n\n9 Replace the cap on the nasal spray. \n\n \n\nCleaning the nasal spray \n\nAfter each use: \n\n1 Wipe the nozzle and inside of the cap with a clean, dry tissue – see pictures i and j.  \n\n \n\n2 Do not use water to clean it.  \n\n3 Never use a pin or anything sharp on the nozzle.  \n\n4 Always replace the cap once you have finished. \n\n If the nasal spray does not seem to be working: \n\n• Check you still have medicine left. Look at the level through the window. If the level is very low \nthere may not be enough left to work the nasal spray. \n\n• Check the nasal spray for damage  \n\n• If you think the nozzle may be blocked, don’t use a pin or anything sharp to clear it.  \n\n• Try to reset it by following the instructions under ‘Preparing the nasal spray for use’.  \n\n• If it is still not working, or if it produces a jet of liquid, take the nasal spray back to the pharmacy to \nget advice. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
