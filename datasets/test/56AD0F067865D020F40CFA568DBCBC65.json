NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAtripla 600 mg/200 mg/245 mg film-coated tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains 600 mg of efavirenz, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of \ntenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nPink, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablet, of dimensions 20 mm x 10.4 mm, debossed with \u201c123\u201d on \none side, plain on the other side. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nAtripla is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  It is \nindicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged \n18 years and over with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current \ncombination antiretroviral therapy for more than three months.  Patients must not have experienced \nvirological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and must be known not to have harboured virus \nstrains with mutations conferring significant resistance to any of the three components contained in \nAtripla prior to initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nThe demonstration of the benefit of Atripla is primarily based on 48-week data from a clinical study in \nwhich patients with stable virologic suppression on a combination antiretroviral therapy changed to \nAtripla (see section 5.1).  No data are currently available from clinical studies with Atripla in \ntreatment-na\u00efve or in heavily pretreated patients. \n \nNo data are available to support the combination of Atripla and other antiretroviral agents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose of Atripla is one tablet taken orally once daily. \n \nIf a patient misses a dose of Atripla within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should \ntake Atripla as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses a dose of \nAtripla by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for the next dose, the patient should not take the \nmissed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Atripla, another tablet should be taken.  If the patient \nvomits more than 1 hour after taking Atripla he/she does not need to take another dose. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nIt is recommended that Atripla be taken on an empty stomach since food may increase efavirenz \nexposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \nIn order to improve the tolerability to efavirenz with respect to undesirable effects on the nervous \nsystem, bedtime dosing is recommended (see section 4.8). \n \nIt is anticipated that tenofovir exposure (AUC) will be approximately 30% lower following \nadministration of Atripla on an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenofovir \ndisoproxil when taken with food (see section 5.2).  Data on the clinical translation of the decrease in \npharmacokinetic exposure are not available.  In virologically suppressed patients, the clinical \nrelevance of this reduction can be expected to be limited (see section 5.1). \n \nWhere discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of Atripla is indicated or where dose \nmodification is necessary, separate preparations of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil \nare available.  Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. \n \nIf therapy with Atripla is discontinued, consideration should be given to the long half-life of efavirenz \n(see section 5.2) and long intracellular half-lives of emtricitabine and tenofovir.  Because of \ninterpatient variability in these parameters and concerns regarding development of resistance, HIV \ntreatment guidelines should be consulted, also taking into consideration the reason for discontinuation. \n \nDose adjustment: If Atripla is co-administered with rifampicin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an \nadditional 200 mg/day (800 mg total) of efavirenz may be considered (see section 4.5). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nAtripla should be administered with caution to elderly patients (see section 4.4). \n \nRenal impairment \nAtripla is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance (CrCl) < 50 ml/min).  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require dose \ninterval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil  that cannot be achieved with the \ncombination tablet (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of Atripla have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.  Patients \nwith mild liver disease (Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT), Class A) may be treated with the normal \nrecommended dose of Atripla (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).  Patients should be monitored carefully \nfor adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms related to efavirenz (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n \nIf Atripla is discontinued in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV, these patients should be closely \nmonitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Atripla in children under the age of 18 years have not been established \n(see section 5.2). \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAtripla tablets should be swallowed whole with water, once daily. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nSevere hepatic impairment (CPT, Class C) (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nCo-administration with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, \nor ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine).  \nCompetition for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism \nand create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions (for example, cardiac \narrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression) (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the expected significant decreases in plasma \nconcentrations of elbasvir and grazoprevir.  This effect is due to induction of CYP3A4 or P-gp by \nefavirenz and may result in loss of therapeutic effect of elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with voriconazole.  Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plasma \nconcentrations while voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations.  Since \nAtripla is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration with herbal preparations containing St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to \nthe risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). \n \nAdministration to patients with: \n\n- a family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval on \nelectrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. \n\n- a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with \ncongestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. \n\n- severe disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. \n \nCo-administration with drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval (proarrhythmic).  \nThese drugs include: \n\n- antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, \n- neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, \n- certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, \n\nfluoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antifungal agents, \n- certain non-sedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole), \n- cisapride, \n- flecainide, \n- certain antimalarials,  \n- methadone (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \n\n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n \nAs a fixed combination, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal \nproducts containing the same active components, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil.  Atripla should \nnot be co-administered with products containing efavirenz unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. with \nrifampicin (see section 4.2).  Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Atripla should not be administered \nconcomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.5).  Atripla should not \nbe administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil or with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide. \n \nCo-administration of Atripla and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nCo-administration of Atripla and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is not \nrecommended since plasma concentrations of velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are expected to decrease \n\n\n\n5 \n\nfollowing co-administration with efavirenz leading to reduced therapeutic effect of \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (see section 4.5). \n \nNo data are available on the safety and efficacy of Atripla in combination with other antiretroviral \nagents. \n \nConcomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5). \n \nSwitching from a PI-based antiretroviral regimen \n \nCurrently available data indicate a trend that in patients on a PI-based antiretroviral regimen the switch \nto Atripla may lead to a reduction of the response to the therapy (see section 5.1).  These patients \nshould be carefully monitored for rises in viral load and, since the safety profile of efavirenz differs \nfrom that of protease inhibitors, for adverse reactions. \n \nOpportunistic infections \n \nPatients receiving Atripla or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic \ninfections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should remain under close clinical \nobservation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \n \nTransmission of HIV \n \nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded.  Precautions to prevent transmission \nshould be taken in accordance with national guidelines. \n \nEffect of food \n \nThe administration of Atripla with food may increase efavirenz exposure (see section 5.2) and may \nlead to an increase in frequency of adverse reactions (see section 4.8).  It is recommended that Atripla \nbe taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. \n \nLiver disease \n \nThe pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been established in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders (see section 5.2).  Atripla is contraindicated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) and not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic \nimpairment.  Since efavirenz is principally metabolised by the CYP system, caution should be \nexercised in administering Atripla to patients with mild hepatic impairment.  These patients should be \ncarefully monitored for efavirenz adverse reactions, especially nervous system symptoms.  Laboratory \ntests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic intervals (see section 4.2). \n \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or \npersistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal \nrange, the benefit of continued therapy with Atripla needs to be weighed against the potential risks of \nsignificant liver toxicity.  In such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be \nconsidered (see section 4.8).  \n \nIn patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver \nenzymes is also recommended. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHepatic events \nPost-marketing reports of hepatic failure also occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease \nor other identifiable risk factors (see section 4.8).  Liver enzyme monitoring should be considered for \nall patients independent of pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. \n \nPatients with HIV and hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV) co-infection \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with CART are at an increased risk for severe and \npotentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.  \n \nPhysicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines for the optimal management of \nHIV infection in patients co-infected with HBV. \n \nIn case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary \nof Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been studied for the treatment of chronic HBV infection.  \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir individually and in combination have shown activity against HBV in \npharmacodynamic studies (see section 5.1).  Limited clinical experience suggests that emtricitabine \nand tenofovir disoproxil have an anti-HBV activity when used in antiretroviral combination therapy to \ncontrol HIV infection.  Discontinuation of Atripla therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV \nmay be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and \nHBV who discontinue Atripla must be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up \nfor at least four months after stopping treatment with Atripla.  If appropriate, resumption of anti-\nhepatitis B therapy may be warranted.  In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment \ndiscontinuation is not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic \ndecompensation. \n \nQTc Prolongation \n \nQTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). For patients \nat increased risk of Torsade de Pointes or who are receiving drugs with a known risk for Torsade de \nPointes, consider alternatives to Atripla. \n \nPsychiatric symptoms \n \nPsychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz.  Patients with a \nprior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of serious psychiatric adverse \nreactions.  In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression.  \nThere have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, \npsychosis-like behaviour, and catatonia.  Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms \nsuch as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately \nto assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to \ndetermine whether the risk of continued therapy outweighs the benefits (see section 4.8). \n \nNervous system symptoms \n \nSymptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and \nabnormal dreaming are frequently reported undesirable effects in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg \ndaily in clinical studies.  Dizziness was also seen in clinical studies with emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil.  Headache has been reported in clinical studies with emtricitabine (see section 4.8).  \nNervous system symptoms associated with efavirenz usually begin during the first one or two days of \ntherapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks.  Patients should be informed that if they \ndo occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are not predictive \nof subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSeizures \n \nConvulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of a known \nmedical history of seizures.  Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medicinal products \nprimarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, may require \nperiodic monitoring of plasma levels.  In a drug interaction study, carbamazepine plasma \nconcentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with efavirenz \n(see section 4.5).  Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nAtripla is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 50 ml/min).  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose adjustment \nof emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet \n(see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  Use of Atripla should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a \nnephrotoxic medicinal product.  If concomitant use of Atripla and nephrotoxic agents (e.g. \naminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir, \ninterleukin-2) is unavoidable, renal function must be monitored weekly (see section 4.5). \n \nCases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors \nfor renal dysfunction.  If Atripla is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be \nmonitored adequately. \n \nRenal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy \n(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil  in clinical \npractice (see section 4.8). \n \nIt is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with \nAtripla and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored after two to \nfour weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and every three to six months thereafter in \npatients without renal risk factors.  In patients with a history of renal dysfunction or in patients who \nare at risk of renal dysfunction, a more frequent monitoring of renal function is required. \n \nIf serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in \nany patient receiving Atripla, renal function must be re-evaluated within one week, including \nmeasurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, \nproximal tubulopathy).  Since Atripla is a combination product and the dosing interval of the \nindividual components cannot be altered, treatment with Atripla must be interrupted in patients with \nconfirmed creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl \n(0.32 mmol/l).  Interrupting treatment with Atripla should also be considered in case of progressive \ndecline of renal function when no other cause has been identified.  Where discontinuation of therapy \nwith one of the components of Atripla is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate \npreparations of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil  are available. \n \nBone effects \n \nIn a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil with stavudine in \ncombination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, small decreases in bone \nmineral density of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups.  Decreases in bone \nmineral density of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in \nthe tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in bone mineral density of the hip \nwere significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no increased risk of \nfractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks. \n \nIn other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen \nin patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease \n\n\n\n8 \n\ninhibitor.  Alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are \nat a high risk for fractures. \n \nBone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal \ntubulopathy (see section 4.8).  If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation \nshould be obtained. \n \nSkin reactions \n \nMild-to-moderate rash has been reported with the individual components of Atripla.  The rash \nassociated with the efavirenz component usually resolves with continued therapy.  Appropriate \nantihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash.  \nSevere rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation or ulceration has been reported in less than \n1% of patients treated with efavirenz (see section 4.8).  The incidence of erythema multiforme or \nStevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 0.1%.  Atripla must be discontinued in patients \ndeveloping severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or fever.  \nExperience with efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class \nis limited.  Atripla is not recommended for patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction \n(e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) while taking an NNRTI. \n \nWeight and metabolic parameters \n \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \n \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero \n \nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \n \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus \nretinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.  \nAny inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nOsteonecrosis \n \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \nPatients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations \n \nAtripla should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R, M184V/I or K103N mutation \n(see sections 4.1 and 5.1). \n \nElderly \n \nAtripla has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. Elderly patients are more likely to have \ndecreased hepatic or renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \npatients with Atripla (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nAs Atripla contains efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions that have been \nidentified with these agents individually may occur with Atripla.  Interaction studies with these agents \nhave only been performed in adults. \n \nAs a fixed combination, Atripla should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal \nproducts containing the components, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil.  Atripla should not be co-\nadministered with products containing efavirenz unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. with \nrifampicin (see section 4.2).  Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Atripla should not be administered \nconcomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine.  Atripla should not be administered \nconcomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil or with medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nEfavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1.  Compounds that are substrates of \nthese enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz.  \nEfavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however, inhibition has also been observed \nin vitro and the net effect of co-administration with substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nEfavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example ritonavir) or \nfood (for example, grapefruit juice) which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity.  Compounds or herbal \npreparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John\u2019s wort) which induce these enzymes \nmay give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz.  Concomitant use of St. John\u2019s wort is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).  Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). \n \nIn vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP-mediated \ninteractions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products is low. \n \nCannabinoid test interaction \n \nEfavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors.  False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have \nbeen reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV infected subjects receiving efavirenz.  \nConfirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is \nrecommended in such cases. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nContraindications of concomitant use \n \nAtripla must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, \ntriazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, \nergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, \nlife-threatening events (see section 4.3). \n \nElbasvir/grazoprevir: Co-administration of Atripla with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated \nbecause it may lead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.3 and Table 1). \n \nVoriconazole: Co-administration of standard doses of efavirenz and voriconazole is contraindicated.  \nSince Atripla is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, \nvoriconazole and Atripla must not be co-administered (see section 4.3 and Table 1). \n \nSt. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum): Co-administration of Atripla and St. John\u2019s wort or herbal \npreparations containing St. John\u2019s wort is contraindicated.  Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced \nby concomitant use of St. John\u2019s wort due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport \nproteins by St. John\u2019s wort.  If a patient is already taking St. John\u2019s wort, stop St. John\u2019s wort, check \nviral levels and if possible efavirenz levels.  Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John\u2019s wort.  \nThe inducing effect of St. John\u2019s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment \n(see section 4.3). \n \nQT Prolonging Drugs: Atripla is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs that are known to \nprolong the QTc interval and could lead to Torsade de Pointes, such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA \nand III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the \nfollowing classes: macrolides,  fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain \nnon-sedating antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and \nmethadone (see section 4.3). \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nAtazanavir/ritonavir: Insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for \natazanavir/ritonavir in combination with Atripla.  Therefore co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir \nand Atripla is not recommended (see Table 1). \n \nDidanosine: Co-administration of Atripla and didanosine is not recommended (see Table 1). \n \nSofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir: Co-administration of Atripla and \nsofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and \nTable 1) \n \nRenally eliminated medicinal products: Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by \nthe kidneys, co-administration of Atripla with medicinal products that reduce renal function or \ncompete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of \nemtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products. \n \nUse of Atripla should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.  \nSome examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, \nganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). \n \nOther interactions \n \nInteractions between Atripla or its individual component(s) and other medicinal products are listed in \nTable 1 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, twice daily as \u201cb.i.d.\u201d, \nonce daily as \u201cq.d.\u201d and once every 8 hours as \u201cq8h\u201d).

There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic \ninteractions when tenofovir disoproxil was co-administered with emtricitabine or ribavirin. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential (see below and section 5.3) \n \nPregnancy should be avoided in women receiving Atripla.  Women of childbearing potential should \nundergo pregnancy testing before initiation of Atripla. \n \nContraception in males and females \n \nBarrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for \nexample, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5) while on therapy with Atripla.  \nBecause of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after \ndiscontinuation of Atripla is recommended.   \n \nPregnancy \n \nEfavirenz: There have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, \nincluding meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any \nefavirenz-containing fixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester.  Two additional cases \n(1 prospective and 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been \nreported with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir \ndisoproxil.  A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and \nthe denominator is unknown.  As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal \ndevelopment (at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women exposed \nto efavirenz during the first trimester of pregnancy.  \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nAs of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of \n904 pregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live \nbirths.  One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other \nbirth defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-efavirenz-containing regimens, as \nwell as those in HIV negative controls.  The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population \nranges from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births. \n \nMalformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3).  \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil: A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 \npregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil.  Animal studies on emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil do \nnot indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nAtripla should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires \ntreatment with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nEfavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk.  There is \ninsufficient information on the effects of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants.  A \nrisk to the infants cannot be excluded.  Therefore Atripla should not be used during breast-feeding. \n \nAs a general rule, it is recommended that HIV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in order \nto avoid transmission of HIV to the infant. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of Atripla are available.  Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects of \nefavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  However, \ndizziness has been reported during treatment with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil.  \nEfavirenz may also cause impaired concentration and/or somnolence.  Patients should be instructed \nthat if they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving \nand operating machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil has been studied in 460 patients \neither as the fixed-dose combination tablet Atripla (study AI266073) or as the component products \n(study GS-01-934).  Adverse reactions were generally consistent with those seen in previous studies of \nthe individual components.  The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or \nprobably related to Atripla among patients treated up to 48 weeks in study AI266073 were psychiatric \ndisorders (16%), nervous system disorders (13%), and gastrointestinal disorders (7%). \n \nSevere skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; neuropsychiatric \nadverse reactions (including severe depression, death by suicide, psychosis-like behaviour, seizures); \nsevere hepatic events; pancreatitis and lactic acidosis (sometimes fatal) have been reported. \n \nRare events of renal impairment, renal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy \n(including Fanconi syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to \n\n\n\n30 \n\nfractures) have also been reported.  Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients \nreceiving Atripla (see section 4.4). \n \nDiscontinuation of Atripla therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with \nsevere acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4). \n \nThe administration of Atripla with food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase \nin the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe adverse reactions from clinical study and post-marketing experience with Atripla and the \nindividual components of Atripla in antiretroviral combination therapy are listed in Table 2 below by \nbody system organ class, frequency and the component(s) of Atripla to which the adverse reactions are \nattributable.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), \nuncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000). \n \nAdverse reactions associated with the use of Atripla: Treatment-emergent adverse reactions \nconsidered possibly or probably related to Atripla reported in study AI266073 (over 48 weeks; \nn = 203), which have not been associated with one of the individual components of Atripla, include: \n \nCommon: - anorexia \n \nUncommon: - dry mouth \n - incoherent speech \n - increased appetite \n - libido decreased \n - myalgia \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions associated with Atripla listed by the component(s) of Atripla to which \nthe adverse reactions are attributable \n \n\n Atripla \nEfavirenz Emtricitabine Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: \nCommon  neutropenia  \nUncommon  anaemia1  \nImmune system disorders: \nCommon  allergic reaction  \nUncommon hypersensitivity   \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: \nVery common   hypophosphataemia2 \nCommon hypertriglyceridaemia3 hyperglycaemia, \n\nhypertriglyceridaemia \n \n\nUncommon hypercholesterolaemia3  hypokalaemia2 \nRare   lactic acidosis \n\n\n\n31 \n\n Atripla \nEfavirenz Emtricitabine Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nPsychiatric disorders: \nCommon depression (severe in \n\n1.6%)3, anxiety3, \nabnormal dreams3, \ninsomnia3 \n\nabnormal dreams, \ninsomnia \n\n \n\nUncommon suicide attempt3, suicide \nideation3, psychosis3, \nmania3, paranoia3, \nhallucination3, euphoric \nmood3, affect lability3, \nconfusional state3, \naggression3, catatonia3 \n\n  \n\nRare completed suicide3,4, \ndelusion3,4, neurosis3,4 \n\n  \n\nNervous system disorders: \nVery common  headache dizziness \nCommon cerebellar coordination \n\nand balance \ndisturbances3, \nsomnolence (2.0%)3, \nheadache (5.7%)3, \ndisturbance in attention \n(3.6%)3, dizziness \n(8.5%)3 \n\ndizziness headache \n\nUncommon convulsions3, amnesia3, \nthinking abnormal3, \nataxia3, coordination \nabnormal3, agitation3, \ntremor \n\n  \n\nEye disorders: \nUncommon vision blurred   \nEar and labyrinth disorders: \nUncommon tinnitus, vertigo   \nVascular disorders: \nUncommon flushing   \nGastrointestinal disorders: \nVery common  diarrhoea, nausea diarrhoea, vomiting, \n\nnausea \nCommon diarrhoea, vomiting, \n\nabdominal pain, nausea \nelevated amylase \nincluding elevated \npancreatic amylase, \nelevated serum lipase, \nvomiting, abdominal \npain, dyspepsia \n\nabdominal pain, \nabdominal distension, \nflatulence \n\nUncommon pancreatitis  pancreatitis \nHepatobiliary disorders: \nCommon elevated aspartate \n\naminotransferase (AST), \nelevated alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), \nelevated gamma-\nglutamyltransferase \n(GGT) \n\nelevated serum AST \nand/or elevated serum \nALT, \nhyperbilirubinaemia \n\nincreased transaminases \n\nUncommon hepatitis acute   \nRare hepatic failure3,4  hepatic steatosis, \n\nhepatitis \n\n\n\n32 \n\n Atripla \nEfavirenz Emtricitabine Tenofovir disoproxil \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nVery common rash (moderate-severe, \n\n11.6%, all grades, 18%)3 \n rash \n\nCommon pruritus vesiculobullous rash, \npustular rash, \nmaculopapular rash, \nrash, pruritus, urticaria, \nskin discolouration \n(increased \npigmentation)1 \n\n \n\nUncommon Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome, erythema \nmultiforme3, severe rash \n(< 1%) \n\nangioedema4  \n\nRare photoallergic dermatitis  angioedema \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: \nVery common  elevated creatine kinase  \nUncommon   rhabdomyolysis2, \n\nmuscular weakness2 \nRare   osteomalacia (manifested \n\nas bone pain and \ninfrequently contributing \nto fractures)2,4, \nmyopathy2 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders: \nUncommon   increased creatinine, \n\nproteinuria, proximal \nrenal tubulopathy \nincluding Fanconi \nsyndrome \n\nRare   renal failure (acute and \nchronic), acute tubular \nnecrosis, nephritis \n(including acute \ninterstitial nephritis)4, \nnephrogenic diabetes \ninsipidus \n\nReproductive system and breast disorders: \nUncommon gynaecomastia   \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: \nVery common   asthenia \nCommon fatigue pain, asthenia  \n\n1 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was \nadministered to paediatric patients. \n2 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally \nassociated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. \n3 See section 4.8 Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. \n4 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for either efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir \ndisoproxil.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients treated \nwith efavirenz in clinical trials (n = 3,969) or exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical trials (n = 1,563) or \nexposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and the expanded access programme (n = 7,319). \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nRash: In clinical trials of efavirenz, rashes were usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin \neruptions that occurred within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz.  In most patients \nrash resolved with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month.  Atripla can be reinitiated in \npatients interrupting therapy because of rash.  Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids \nis recommended when Atripla is restarted. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nPsychiatric symptoms: Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of \nserious psychiatric adverse reactions listed in the efavirenz column of Table 2. \n \nNervous system symptoms: Nervous system symptoms are common with efavirenz, one of the \ncomponents of Atripla.  In clinical controlled studies of efavirenz, nervous system symptoms of \nmoderate to severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients, and 2% of patients \ndiscontinued therapy due to such symptoms.  They usually begin during the first one or two days of \nefavirenz therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks.  They may occur more \nfrequently when Atripla is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma \nlevels (see section 5.2).  Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms \n(see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic failure with efavirenz: Hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic \ndisease or other identifiable risk factors, as reported post-marketing, were sometimes characterised by \na fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death. \n \nRenal impairment: As Atripla may cause renal damage, monitoring of renal function is recommended \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally \nresolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines \nin creatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  \nPatients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV \ndisease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of \nexperiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nLactic acidosis: Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in \ncombination with other antiretrovirals.  Patients with predisposing factors such as severe hepatic \nimpairment (CPT, Class C) (see section 4.3), or patients receiving concomitant medications known to \ninduce lactic acidosis are at increased risk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir \ndisoproxil treatment, including fatal outcomes. \n \nMetabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during \nantiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections \nmay arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been \nreported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many \nmonths after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nOsteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally \nacknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of \nthis is unknown (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nInsufficient safety data are available for children below 18 years of age.  Atripla is not recommended \nin this population (see section 4.2). \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly: Atripla has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more likely to \nhave decreased hepatic or renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly \npatients with Atripla (see section 4.2). \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPatients with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring \nof renal function is recommended in any patient with mild renal impairment treated with Atripla \n(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: Only a limited number of patients were co-infected with HBV \n(n = 13) or HCV (n = 26) in study GS-01-934.  The adverse reaction profile of efavirenz, emtricitabine \nand tenofovir disoproxil in patients co-infected with HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV was similar to that \nobserved in patients infected with HIV without co-infection.  However, as would be expected in this \npatient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general \nHIV infected population. \n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HIV infected patients co-infected with \nHBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis may occur after discontinuation of treatment \n(see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSome patients accidentally taking 600 mg efavirenz twice daily have reported increased nervous \nsystem symptoms.  One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. \n \nIf overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and \nstandard supportive treatment applied as necessary. \n \nAdministration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz.  There is no \nspecific antidote for overdose with efavirenz.  Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is \nunlikely to remove significant quantities of it from blood. \n \nUp to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by \nhaemodialysis.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal \ndialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, \ncombinations, ATC code: J05AR06 \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nEfavirenz is an NNRTI of HIV-1.  Efavirenz non-competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase \n(RT) and does not significantly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) RT or cellular \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4).  Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of \ncytidine.  Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate \n(nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. \n \nEmtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate \nand tenofovir diphosphate, respectively.  In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and \ntenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells.  Emtricitabine triphosphate \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n35 \n\nand tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain \ntermination. \n \nBoth emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA \npolymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo.  \n \nCardiac Electrophysiology \n \nThe effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo \ncontrolled, fixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects \nenriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms.  The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 \ngenotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax \nobserved in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype.  A positive relationship between efavirenz \nconcentration and QTc prolongation was observed.  Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the \nmean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in \nsubjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days \n(see section 4.5).           \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro \n \nEfavirenz demonstrated antiviral activity against most non-clade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, \nD, F, G, J, and N) but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses.  Emtricitabine displayed \nantiviral activity against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.  Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity \nagainst HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O.  Both emtricitabine and tenofovir showed strain \nspecific activity against HIV-2 and antiviral activity against HBV. \n \nIn combination studies evaluating the in vitro antiviral activity of efavirenz and emtricitabine together, \nefavirenz and tenofovir together, and emtricitabine and tenofovir together, additive to synergistic \nantiviral effects were observed. \n \nResistance \n \nResistance to efavirenz can be selected in vitro and resulted in single or multiple amino acid \nsubstitutions in HIV-1 RT, including L100I, V108I, V179D, and Y181C.  K103N was the most \nfrequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who experienced rebound in viral \nload during clinical studies of efavirenz.  Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, \n190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N.  \nCross-resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in vitro demonstrated that the \nK103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. \n \nThe potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the different binding \nsites on the target and mechanism of action.  The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and \nPIs is low because of the different enzyme targets involved. \n \nResistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due \nto the development of an M184V or M184I substitution in RT with emtricitabine or a K65R \nsubstitution in RT with tenofovir.  Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were \ncross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and \nzidovudine.  The K65R mutation can also be selected by abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced \nsusceptibility to these agents plus lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir.  Tenofovir disoproxil \nshould be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation.  Both the K65R and \nM184V/I mutation remain fully susceptible to efavirenz.  In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 \nRT has been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, \nemtricitabine, lamivudine and tenofovir. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPatients with HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that \nincluded either an M41L or an L210W substitution in RT showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir \ndisoproxil. \n \nIn vivo resistance (antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients): In a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study \n(GS-01-934) in antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, where efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil \nwere used as individual formulations (or as efavirenz and the fixed combination of emtricitabine and \ntenofovir disoproxil (Truvada) from week 96 to 144), genotyping was performed on plasma \nHIV-1 isolates from all patients with confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/ml at week 144 or early study \ndrug discontinuation (see section on Clinical experience).  As of week 144: \n \n\u2022 The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the \n\nefavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed \nfrom the efavirenz + lamivudine/zidovudine group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher\u2019s Exact test \ncomparing the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group \namong all subjects). \n\n\u2022 No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation. \n\u2022 Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from \n\n13/19 (68%) patients in the efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group and in virus \nfrom 21/29 (72%) patients in the efavirenz + lamivudine/zidovudine group.  A summary of \nresistance mutation development is shown in Table 3. \n\n \nTable 3: Development of resistance in study GS-01-934 through week 144 \n \n\n \n\nEfavirenz+ \nemtricitabine+ \n\ntenofovir disoproxil  \n(N=244) \n\nEfavirenz+lamivudine/zid\novudine \n(N=243) \n\nResistance analysis by week 144  19  31 \nOn-therapy genotypes 19 (100%) 29 (100%) \nEfavirenz resistance1 13 (68%) 21 (72%) \n\nK103N 8 (42%) 18* (62%) \nK101E 3 (16%) 3 (10%) \nG190A/S 2 (10.5%) 4 (14%) \nY188C/H 1 (5%) 2 (7%) \nV108I 1 (5%) 1 (3%) \nP225H 0  2 (7%) \n\nM184V/I 2 (10.5%) 10* (34.5%) \nK65R 0  0  \nK70E 0  0  \nTAMs2 0  2 (7%) \n* p-value < 0.05, Fisher\u2019s Exact test comparing efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group to efavirenz \n\n+ lamivudine/zidovudine group among all patients. \n1 Other efavirenz resistance mutations included A98G (n=1), K103E (n=1), V179D (n=1), and M230L (n=1). \n2 Thymidine analogue associated mutations included D67N (n=1) and K70R (n=1). \n\n \nIn the open-label extended phase of study GS-01-934, where patients received Atripla on an empty \nstomach, 3 additional cases of resistance were seen.  All 3 subjects had received a fixed dose \ncombination of lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir) and efavirenz for 144 weeks and then switched \nto Atripla. Two subjects with confirmed virologic rebound developed NNRTI resistance-associated \nsubstitutions to efavirenz including K103N, V106V/I/M and Y188Y/C reverse transcriptase \nsubstitutions at week 240 (96 weeks on Atripla) and week 204 (60 weeks on Atripla).  A third subject \nhad pre-existing NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions to efavirenz and the M184V reverse \ntranscriptase resistance-associated substitution to emtricitabine at entry into the Atripla extension \nphase and experienced a suboptimal virologic response, and developed K65K/R, S68N and K70K/E \nNRTI resistance-associated substitutions at week 180 (36 weeks on Atripla). \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\nPlease refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the individual components for additional \ninformation regarding in vivo resistance with these medicinal products. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nIn a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve \nHIV-1 infected patients received either a once-daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir \ndisoproxil or a fixed combination of lamivudine and zidovudine (Combivir) administered twice daily \nand efavirenz once daily (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Truvada).  \nPatients who completed 144 weeks of treatment with either treatment arm in study GS-01-934 were \ngiven the option to continue in an open-label extended phase of the study with Atripla on an empty \nstomach.  Data are available from 286 patients who switched to Atripla: 160 had previously received \nefavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, and 126 had previously received Combivir and \nefavirenz.  High rates of virologic suppression were maintained by subjects from both initial treatment \ngroups who then received Atripla in the open-label extended phase of the study.  After 96 weeks of \nAtripla treatment, HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations remained < 50 copies/ml in 82% of patients and \n< 400 copies/ml in 85% of patients (intention to treat analysis (ITT), missing=failure). \n \nStudy AI266073 was a 48-week open-label randomised clinical study in HIV infected patients \ncomparing the efficacy of Atripla to antiretroviral therapy consisting of at least two nucleoside or \nnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitor; however not a regimen containing all Atripla components (efavirenz, \nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil).  Atripla was administered on an empty stomach \n(see section 4.2).  Patients had never experienced virological failure on a previous antiretroviral \ntherapy, had no known HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to any of the three components within \nAtripla, and had been virologically suppressed for at least three months at baseline.  Patients either \nchanged to Atripla (N=203) or continued on their original antiretroviral treatment regimen (N=97).  \nForty-eight week data showed that high levels of virologic suppression, comparable to the original \ntreatment regimen, were maintained in patients who were randomised to change to Atripla \n(see Table 4). \n \nTable 4: 48-week efficacy data from study AI266073 in which Atripla was administered to \nvirologically suppressed patients on combination antiretroviral therapy \n \n Treatment group  \n\nEndpoint Atripla (N=203) \nn/N (%) \n\nStayed on original \ntreatment regimen \n\n(N=97) \nn/N (%) \n\nDifference between Atripla and \noriginal treatment regimen \n\n(95%CI) \n\n patients with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml \nPVR (KM) 94.5% 85.5% 8.9% (-7.7% to 25.6%) \nM=Excluded 179/181 (98.9%) 85/87 (97.7%) 1.2% (-2.3% to 6.7%) \nM=Failure 179/203 (88.2%) 85/97 (87.6%) 0.5% (-7.0% to 9.3%) \nModified LOCF 190/203 (93.6%) 94/97 (96.9%) -3.3 (-8.3% to 2.7%) \n patients with HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/ml \nPVR (KM) 98.4% 98.9% -0.5% (-3.2% to 2.2%) \nM=Excluded 181/181 (100%) 87/87 (100%) 0% (-2.4% to 4.2%) \nM=Failure 181/203 (89.2%) 87/97 (89.7%) -0.5% (-7.6% to 7.9%) \nPVR (KM): Pure virologic response assessed using the Kaplan Meier (KM) method \nM: Missing \nModified LOCF: Post-hoc analysis where patients who failed virologically or discontinued for adverse events were treated as \nfailures; for other drop-outs, the LOCF (last observation carried forward) method was applied \n \nWhen the two strata were analysed separately, response rates in the stratum with prior PI-treatment \nwere numerically lower for patients switched to Atripla [92.4% versus 94.0% for the PVR (sensitivity \nanalysis) for Atripla and SBR patients respectively; a difference (95%CI) of -1.6% (-10.0%, 6.7%).

In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once \ndaily, steady-state peak concentration (Cmax) was 12.9 \u00b1 3.7 \u00b5M (29%) [mean \u00b1 standard deviation \n(S.D.) (coefficient of variation (%CV))], steady-state Cmin was 5.6 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b5M (57%), and AUC was \n184 \u00b1 73 \u00b5M\u2022h (40%). \n \nEmtricitabine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose.  \nFollowing multiple dose oral administration of emtricitabine to 20 HIV infected patients, steady-state \nCmax was 1.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5g/ml (mean \u00b1 S.D.) (39%CV), steady-state Cmin was 0.09 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5g/ml (80%) and \nthe AUC was 10.0 \u00b1 3.1 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml (31%) over a 24 hour dosing interval. \n \nFollowing oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV-1 infected \npatients in the fasted state, maximum tenofovir concentrations were achieved within one hour and the \nCmax and AUC (mean \u00b1 S.D.) (%CV) values were 296 \u00b1 90 ng/ml (30%) and 2,287 \u00b1 685 ng\u2022h/ml \n(30%), respectively.  The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted patients \nwas approximately 25%. \n \nEffect of food \n \nAtripla has not been evaluated in the presence of food. \n \nAdministration of efavirenz capsules with a high fat meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of \nefavirenz by 28% and 79%, respectively, compared to administration in a fasted state.  Compared to \nfasted administration, dosing of tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine in combination with either a \nhigh fat meal or a light meal increased the mean AUC of tenofovir by 43.6% and 40.5%, and Cmax by \n16% and 13.5%, respectively without affecting emtricitabine exposures. \n \nAtripla is recommended for administration on an empty stomach since food may increase efavirenz \nexposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  \nIt is anticipated that tenofovir exposure (AUC) will be approximately 30% lower following \nadministration of Atripla on an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenofovir \ndisoproxil when taken with food (see section 5.1). \n \nDistribution \n \nEfavirenz is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. \n \nIn vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins is < 4% and independent of concentrations \nover the range of 0.02 to 200 \u00b5g/ml.  Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution \nof emtricitabine was approximately 1.4 l/kg.  After oral administration, emtricitabine is widely \ndistributed throughout the body.  The mean plasma to blood concentration ratio was approximately 1.0 \nand the mean semen to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 4.0. \n \nIn vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma or serum protein is < 0.7% and 7.2%, respectively over \nthe tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 \u00b5g/ml.  Following intravenous administration the volume \nof distribution of tenofovir was approximately 800 ml/kg.  After oral administration, tenofovir is \nwidely distributed throughout the body. \n \n\n\n\n40 \n\nBiotransformation \n \nStudies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that efavirenz \nis principally metabolised by the CYP system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent \nglucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites.  These metabolites are essentially inactive against \nHIV-1.  The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible \nfor efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibits CYP isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.  In in vitro studies \nefavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentrations well \nabove those achieved clinically. \n \nEfavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with homozygous G516T genetic variant of \nthe CYP2B6 isozyme.  The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, the \npotential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be \nexcluded. \n \nEfavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own \nmetabolism, which may be clinically relevant in some patients.  In uninfected volunteers, multiple \ndoses of 200 to 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation \n(22 to 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life of 40 to 55 hours (single dose half-life 52 to \n76 hours).  Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1.  Exposures of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 \nsubstrate) are reduced in the presence of efavirenz (see section 4.5, Table 1).  Although in vitro data \nsuggest that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been contradictory reports of both \nincreased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when co-administered with \nefavirenz in vivo.  The net effect of co-administration is not clear. \n \nThere is limited metabolism of emtricitabine.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes \noxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and \nconjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose).  In vitro \nstudies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the \nCYP enzymes.  Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by \nany of the major human CYP isoforms involved in drug biotransformation.  Also, emtricitabine did not \ninhibit uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. \n \nElimination \n \nEfavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses (see also data \nfrom bioequivalence study described above) and 40 to 55 hours after multiple doses.  Approximately \n14 to 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose \nwas excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. \n \nFollowing oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours.  \nEmtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in \nurine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%).  Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine \ndose was recovered in urine as three metabolites.  The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged \n307 ml/min. \n \nFollowing oral administration, the elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours.  \nTenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidneys by both filtration and an active tubular transport system \nwith approximately 70 to 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous \nadministration.  The apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 ml/min.  Renal \nclearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 ml/min, which is in excess of the glomerular \nfiltration rate.  This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of \ntenofovir. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir in elderly \npatients (over 65 years of age). \n \nGender \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir are similar in male and female patients.  Limited \ndata suggest that females may have higher exposure to efavirenz but they do not appear to be less \ntolerant of efavirenz. \n \nEthnicity \nLimited data suggest that Asian and Pacific Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz but \nthey do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. \n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with Atripla in infants and children under 18 years \nof age (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil after co-administration of \nthe separate pharmaceutical forms or as Atripla have not been studied in HIV infected patients with \nrenal impairment. \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters were determined following administration of single doses of the \nindividual preparations of emtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected \npatients with varying degrees of renal impairment.  The degree of renal impairment was defined \naccording to baseline creatinine clearance (normal renal function when creatinine \nclearance > 80 ml/min; mild impairment with creatinine clearance=50 to 79 ml/min; moderate \nimpairment with creatinine clearance=30 to 49 ml/min and severe impairment with creatinine \nclearance=10 to 29 ml/min). \n \nThe mean (%CV) emtricitabine exposure increased from 12 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml (25%) in subjects with normal \nrenal function to 20 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml (6%), 25 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml (23%) and 34 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml (6%) in patients with mild, \nmoderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. \n \nThe mean (%CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 ng\u2022h/ml (12%) in patients with normal \nrenal function, to 3,064 ng\u2022h/ml (30%), 6,009 ng\u2022h/ml (42%) and 15,985 ng\u2022h/ml (45%) in patients \nwith mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. \n \nIn patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug \nexposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 \u00b5g\u2022h/ml (19%) of emtricitabine, and over \n48 hours to 42,857 ng\u2022h/ml (29%) of tenofovir. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal impairment.  However, \nless than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal \nimpairment on exposure to efavirenz is likely to be minimal. \n \nAtripla is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min).  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require dose \ninterval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the \ncombination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of Atripla have not been studied in HIV infected patients with hepatic \nimpairment.  Atripla should be administered with caution to patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \nAtripla must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) and is not \nrecommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  In a single-dose study of efavirenz, \nhalf-life was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte \nClass C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of accumulation.  A multiple-dose study of \nefavirenz showed no significant effect on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte Class A) compared with controls.  There were insufficient data to \ndetermine whether moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte Class B or C) affects \nefavirenz pharmacokinetics. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected patients with \nvarying degrees of hepatic insufficiency.  In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected \npatients were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients. \n \nA single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected patients with \nvarying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to CPT classification.  Tenofovir \npharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment suggesting that no \ndose adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil is required in these subjects. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nEfavirenz: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on efavirenz reveal no special hazard for humans.  \nIn repeated-dose toxicity studies, biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys given \nefavirenz for \u2265 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than those \nin humans given the recommended dose.  The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of dosing.  \nBiliary fibrosis has been observed in rats.  Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some monkeys \nreceiving efavirenz for \u2265 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater than those \nin humans given the recommended dose. \n \nEfavirenz was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays.  Carcinogenicity \nstudies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female mice, but not in \nmale mice.  The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for humans are not \nknown.  Carcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies showed increased foetal resorptions in rats.  No malformations were \nobserved in foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits.  However, malformations were observed \nin 3 of 20 foetuses/newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in \nplasma efavirenz concentrations similar to those seen in humans.  Anencephaly and unilateral \nanophthalmia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, \nmicroophthalmia was observed in another foetus and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus.   \n \nEmtricitabine: Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on \nconventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic \npotential, and toxicity to reproduction and development.  \n \nTenofovir disoproxil: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no \nspecial hazard for humans.  Findings in repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at \nexposure levels greater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical \nuse include renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration.  Bone toxicity \nwas diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs).  \nThe bone toxicity in young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures \u2265 5-fold the exposure in \npaediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures \nfollowing subcutaneous dosing (\u2265 40-fold the exposure in patients).  Findings in the rat and monkey \nstudies indicated that there was a substance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with \npotential secondary reduction in BMD.   \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nGenotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results \nin one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat \nhepatocytes.  However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. \n \nOral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an \nextremely high dose in mice.  These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. \n \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfoetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in \nperi-postnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. \n \nCombination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil: Genotoxicity and repeated-dose toxicity \nstudies of one month or less with the combination of these two components found no exacerbation of \ntoxicological effects compared to studies with the separate components.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.  It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet: \n1. What Atripla is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Atripla \n3. How to take Atripla \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Atripla \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Atripla is and what it is used for \n \nAtripla contains three active substances that are used to treat human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) infection: \n \n- Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) \n- Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) \n- Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) \n \nEach of these active substances, also known as antiretroviral medicines, work by interfering with an \nenzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to multiply. \n \nAtripla is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 18 years \nand over who have previously been treated with other antiretroviral medicines and have their HIV-1 \ninfection under control for at least three months.  Patients must not have experienced failure of a \nprevious HIV therapy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Atripla \n \nDo not take Atripla \n \n- if you are allergic to efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \n- if you have severe liver disease. \n \n- if you have a heart condition, such as an abnormal electrical signal called prolongation of \n\nthe QT interval that puts you at high risk for severe heart rhythm problems (Torsade de \nPointes). \n\n \n- if any member of your family (parents, grandparents, brothers or sisters) has died suddenly due \n\nto a heart problem or was born with heart problems. \n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n- if your doctor has told you that you have high or low levels of electrolytes such as potassium or \nmagnesium in your blood. \n\n \n- if you are currently taking any of the following medicines (see also \u201cOther Medicines and \n\nAtripla\u201d): \n- astemizole or terfenadine (used to treat hay fever or other allergies) \n- bepridil (used to treat heart disease) \n- cisapride (used to treat heartburn) \n- elbasvir/grazoprevir (used to treat hepatitis C) \n- ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and \n\nmethylergonovine) (used to treat migraines and cluster headaches) \n- midazolam or triazolam (used to help you sleep) \n- pimozide, imipramine, amitriptyline or clomipramine (used to treat certain mental \n\nconditions) \n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal preparation used for depression and \n\nanxiety) \n- voriconazole (used to treat fungal infections) \n- flecainide, metoprolol (used to treat irregular heart beat) \n- certain antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole) \n- triazole antifungal agents \n- certain antimalarial agents \n- methadone (used to treat opiate addiction) \n \n\n\uf0e0If you are taking any of these medicines, tell your doctor immediately.  Taking these medicines \nwith Atripla could cause serious or life-threatening side effects or stop these medicines from working \nproperly. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Atripla. \n \n- You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \n\nantiretroviral therapy.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople.  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Atripla you may still \ndevelop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. \n\n \n- You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking Atripla. \n \n- Tell your doctor: \n \n\n- if you are taking other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir \ndisoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil.  Atripla should not \nbe taken with any of these medicines. \n\n \n- if you have or have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your \n\nkidneys.  Atripla is not recommended if you have moderate to severe kidney disease. \n \nAtripla may affect your kidneys.  Before starting treatment, your doctor may order blood \ntests to assess kidney function.  Your doctor may also order blood tests during treatment \nto monitor your kidneys. \n \nAtripla is not usually taken with other medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other \nmedicines and Atripla).  If this is unavoidable, your doctor will monitor your kidney \nfunction once a week. \n \n\n- if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called prolongation \nof the QT interval. \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n- if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or alcohol \n\nabuse.  Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts or have \nstrange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \n\n- if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with \nanticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin.  If you are \ntaking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of anticonvulsant \nmedicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking Atripla.  Your doctor \nmay give you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n \n- if you have a history of liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis.  Patients with \n\nliver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with combination \nantiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially life-threatening liver problems.  \nYour doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check how well your liver is working or \nmay switch you to another medicine.  If you have severe liver disease, do not take \nAtripla (see earlier in section 2, Do not take Atripla). \n\n \nIf you have hepatitis B infection, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment \nregimen for you.  Tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine, two of the active substances in \nAtripla, show some activity against hepatitis B virus although emtricitabine is not \napproved for the treatment of hepatitis B infection.  Symptoms of your hepatitis may \nbecome worse after discontinuation of Atripla.  Your doctor may then conduct blood tests \nat regular intervals in order to check how well your liver is working (see section 3, If you \nstop taking Atripla). \n\n \n- Independent of a history of liver disease, your doctor will consider regular blood tests to \n\ncheck how your liver is working. \n \n- if you are over 65.  Insufficient numbers of patients over 65 years of age have been \n\nstudied.  If you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed Atripla, your doctor will \nmonitor you carefully. \n\n \n- Once you start taking Atripla, look out for: \n \n\n- signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or \nabnormal dreaming.  These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment \nand usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. \n\n \n- any signs of skin rash.  Rashes may be caused by Atripla.  If you see any signs of a \n\nsevere rash with blistering or fever, stop taking Atripla and tell your doctor at once.  If \nyou had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at higher risk of getting a rash \nwith Atripla. \n\n \n- any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection \n\n(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation \nfrom previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started.  It is believed \nthat these symptoms are due to improvement in the body\u2019s immune response, enabling the \nbody to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.  If you \nnotice any symptoms of infection, please tell your doctor at once. \n\n \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs \nwhen the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start \ntaking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may \noccur many months after the start of treatment.  If you notice any symptoms of infection \nor other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet \n\n\n\n55 \n\nand moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please \ninform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n\n \n- bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a \n\nbone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to \nthe bone).  The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be \nsome of the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are joint \nstiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in \nmovement.  If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.  \n\n \nBone problems (sometimes resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to \nkidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n\n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n- Do not give Atripla to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  The use of Atripla in \n\nchildren and adolescents has not been studied. \n \nOther medicines and Atripla \n \nYou must not take Atripla with certain medicines.  These are listed under Do not take Atripla, at \nthe start of section 2.  They include some common medicines and some herbal preparations (including \nSt. John\u2019s wort) which can cause serious interactions. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nAlso, Atripla should not be taken with any other medicines that contain efavirenz (unless \nrecommended by your doctor), emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or \nlamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking other medicines which may damage your kidneys.  Some examples \ninclude: \n- aminoglycosides, vancomycin (medicines for bacterial infections) \n- foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (medicines for viral infections) \n- amphotericin B, pentamidine (medicines for fungal infections) \n- interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) \n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) \n \nAtripla may interact with other medicines, including herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba \nextracts.  As a result, the amounts of Atripla or other medicines in your blood may be affected.  This \nmay stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse.  In some cases, \nyour doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels.  It is important to tell your \ndoctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: \n \n- Medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking Atripla with other antiviral \n\nmedicines that contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may \nreduce CD4 cell counts.  Inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in \nthe blood), which sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines \ncontaining tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together.  Your doctor will carefully \nconsider whether to treat you with medicines containing tenofovir and didanosine. \n\n- Other medicines used for HIV infection: The following protease inhibitors: darunavir, \nindinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, or ritonavir boosted atazanavir or saquinavir.  Your \ndoctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease \ninhibitors.  Also, tell your doctor if you are taking maraviroc. \n\n\n\n56 \n\n- Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: elbasvir/grazoprevir, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. \n\n- Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): Atorvastatin, pravastatin, \nsimvastatin.  Atripla can reduce the amount of statins in your blood.  Your doctor will check \nyour cholesterol levels and will consider changing the dose of your statin, if needed. \n\n- Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): Carbamazepine, phenytoin, \nphenobarbital.  Atripla can reduce the amount of the anticonvulsant in your blood.  \nCarbamazepine can reduce the amount of efavirenz, one of the components of Atripla, in your \nblood.  Your doctor may need to consider giving you a different anticonvulsant. \n\n- Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related \nmycobacterium avium complex: Clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin.  Your doctor may need to \nconsider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic.  In addition, your doctor \nmay consider giving you an additional dose of efavirenz to treat your HIV infection. \n\n- Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): Itraconazole or posaconazole.  \nAtripla can reduce the amount of itraconazole or posaconazole in your blood.  Your doctor may \nneed to consider giving you a different antifungal. \n\n- Medicines used to treat malaria: Atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine.  Atripla \nmay reduce the amount of atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine in your blood. \n\n- Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for \nexample, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): You must \nalso use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding).  Atripla \nmay make hormonal contraceptives less likely to work.  Pregnancies have occurred in women \ntaking efavirenz, a component of Atripla, while using a contraceptive implant, although it has \nnot been established that the efavirenz therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. \n\n- Sertraline, a medicine used to treat depression, as your doctor may need to change your dose of \nsertraline. \n\n- Bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking, as your doctor \nmay need to change your dose of bupropion. \n\n- Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers): When you start taking \nAtripla, your doctor may need to adjust your dose of the calcium channel blocker. \n\n- Medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection (also called immunosuppressants), \nsuch as cyclosporine, sirolimus or tacrolimus.  When you start or stop taking Atripla your doctor \nwill closely monitor your plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its \ndose. \n\n- Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): Your doctor \nmay need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. \n\n- Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation). \n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nWomen should not get pregnant during treatment with Atripla and for 12 weeks thereafter.  \nYour doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting \ntreatment with Atripla. \n \nIf you could get pregnant while receiving Atripla, you need to use a reliable form of barrier \ncontraception (for example, a condom) with other methods of contraception including oral (pill) or \nother hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, injection).  Efavirenz, one of the active \ncomponents of Atripla, may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped.  Therefore, you \nshould continue to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking Atripla. \n \nTell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.  If you are \npregnant, you should take Atripla only if you and your doctor decide it is clearly needed. \n \n\n\n\n57 \n\nSerious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with \nefavirenz during pregnancy.   \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nIf you have taken Atripla during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and other \ndiagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs \nduring pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. \n \nDo not breast-feed during treatment with Atripla.  Both HIV and the ingredients of Atripla may \npass through breast milk and cause serious harm to your baby. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAtripla may cause dizziness, impaired concentration and drowsiness.  If you are affected, do not \ndrive and do not use any tools or machines. \n \nAtripla contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Atripla \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you.  Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is: \nOne tablet taken each day by mouth.  Atripla should be taken on an empty stomach (commonly \ndefined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) preferably at bedtime.  This may make some side \neffects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) less troublesome.  Swallow Atripla whole with water. \n \nAtripla must be taken every day. \n \nIf your doctor decides to stop one of the components of Atripla, you may be given efavirenz, \nemtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other medicines for the treatment of your \nHIV infection. \n \nIf you take more Atripla than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take too many Atripla tablets you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible \nside effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects).  Contact your doctor or nearest \nemergency department for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what \nyou have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Atripla \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Atripla. \n \nIf you do miss a dose of Atripla within 12 hours of when it is usually taken, take it as soon as you \ncan, and then take your next dose at its regular time. \n \nIf it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, do not take the missed dose.  \nWait and take the next dose at the regular time.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten \ntablet. \n \n\n\n\n58 \n\nIf you throw up the tablet (within 1 hour after taking Atripla), you should take another tablet.  Do \nnot wait until your next dose is due.  You do not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than \n1 hour after taking Atripla. \n \nIf you stop taking Atripla \n \nDon\u2019t stop taking Atripla without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Atripla can seriously affect \nyour response to future treatment.  If Atripla is stopped, speak to your doctor before you restart taking \nAtripla tablets.  Your doctor may consider giving you the components of Atripla separately if you are \nhaving problems or need your dose adjusted. \n \nWhen your supply of Atripla starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is \nvery important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a \nshort time.  The virus may then become harder to treat. \n \nIf you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Atripla \ntreatment without talking to your doctor first.  Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms \nindicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of \nthe three components of Atripla).  If Atripla is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume \nhepatitis B treatment.  You may require blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months \nafter stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment \nis not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. \n \n\uf0e0Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly \nsymptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This \nis partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV \nmedicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes. \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nPossible serious side effects: tell your doctor immediately \n \n- Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare (may affect up to 1 in every \n\n1,000 patients) but serious side effect that can be fatal.  The following side effects may be signs \nof lactic acidosis: \n- deep rapid breathing \n- drowsiness \n- feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and stomach pain. \n\n \n\uf0e0If you think you may have lactic acidosis, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nOther possible serious side effects \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (these may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n\u2022 allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) that may cause severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson \n\nsyndrome, erythema multiforme, see section 2)  \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat \n\u2022 angry behaviour, suicidal thoughts, strange thoughts, paranoia, unable to think clearly, mood \n\nbeing affected, seeing or hearing things that are not really there (hallucinations), suicide \n\n\n\n59 \n\nattempts, personality change (psychosis), catatonia (a condition in which the patient is rendered \nmotionless and speechless for a period). \n\n\u2022 pain in the abdomen (stomach), caused by inflammation of the pancreas \n\u2022 forgetfulness, confusion, fitting (seizures), incoherent speech, tremor (shaking) \n\u2022 yellow skin or eyes, itching, or pain in the abdomen (stomach) caused by inflammation of the \n\nliver \n\u2022 damage to kidney tubules \n \nPsychiatric side effects in addition to those listed above include delusions (false beliefs), neurosis.  \nSome patients have committed suicide.  These problems tend to occur more often in those who have a \nhistory of mental illness.  Always notify your doctor immediately if you have these symptoms. \n \nSide effects to the liver: If you are also infected with hepatitis B virus, you may experience a \nworsening of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment (see section 3). \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these may affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients): \n \n\u2022 liver failure, in some cases leading to death or liver transplant.  Most cases occurred in patients \n\nwho already had liver disease, but there have been a few reports in patients without any existing \nliver disease \n\n\u2022 inflammation of the kidney, passing a lot of urine and feeling thirsty \n\u2022 back pain caused by kidney problems, including kidney failure.  Your doctor may do blood tests \n\nto see if your kidneys are working properly \n\u2022 softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in fractures) which may occur \n\ndue to damage to the kidney tubule cells \n\u2022 fatty liver \n \n\uf0e0If you think that you may have any of these serious side effects, talk to your doctor. \n \nMost frequent side effects \n \nThe following side effects are very common (these may affect more than 1 in 10 patients) \n \n\u2022 dizziness, headache, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) \n\u2022 rashes (including red spots or blotches sometimes with blistering and swelling of the skin), \n\nwhich may be allergic reactions \n\u2022 feeling weak \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 decreases in phosphate levels in the blood \n\u2022 increased levels of creatine kinase in the blood that may result in muscle pain and weakness \n \nOther possible side effects \n \nThe following side effects are common (these may affect up to 1 in 10 patients) \n \n\u2022 allergic reactions \n\u2022 disturbances of coordination and balance \n\u2022 feeling worried or depressed \n\u2022 difficulty sleeping, abnormal dreams, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness \n\u2022 pain, stomach pain \n\u2022 problems with digestion resulting in discomfort after meals, feeling bloated, wind (flatulence) \n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\u2022 tiredness \n\u2022 itching \n\n\n\n60 \n\n\u2022 changes in skin colour including darkening of the skin in patches often starting on hands and \nsoles of feet \n\n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 low white blood cell count (a reduced white blood cell count can make you more prone to \n\ninfection) \n\u2022 liver and pancreas problems \n\u2022 increased fatty acids (triglycerides), bilirubin or sugar levels in the blood \n \nThe following side effects are uncommon (these may affect up to 1 in every 100 patients): \n \n\u2022 breakdown of muscle, muscle pain or weakness \n\u2022 anaemia (low red blood cell count) \n\u2022 a feeling of spinning or tilting (vertigo), whistling, ringing or other persistent noise in the ears \n\u2022 blurred vision \n\u2022 chills \n\u2022 breast enlargement in males \n\u2022 decreased sexual drive \n\u2022 flushing \n\u2022 dry mouth \n\u2022 increased appetite \n \nTests may also show: \n\u2022 decreases in potassium in the blood \n\u2022 increases in creatinine in the blood \n\u2022 proteins in urine \n\u2022 increased cholesterol in the blood \n \nThe breakdown of muscle, softening of the bones (with bone pain and sometimes resulting in \nfractures), muscle pain, muscle weakness and decreases in potassium or phosphate in the blood may \noccur due to damage to kidney tubule cells. \n \nThe following side effects are rare (these may affect up to 1 in every 1,000 patients) \n \n\u2022 itchy rash to the skin caused by a reaction to sunlight \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the recommended dose is: one tablet taken each day by mouth. atripla should be taken on an empty stomach (commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) preferably at bedtime. this may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) less troublesome. swallow atripla whole with water. atripla must be taken every day. if your doctor decides to stop one of the components of atripla, you may be given efavirenz, emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. if you take more atripla than you should if you accidentally take too many atripla tablets you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, possible side effects). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take atripla it is important not to miss a dose of atripla. if you do miss a dose of atripla within 12 hours of when it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. if it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose at the regular time. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. if you throw up the tablet (within 1 hour after taking atripla), you should take another tablet. do not wait until your next dose is due. you do not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking atripla. if you stop taking atripla don't stop taking atripla without talking to your doctor. stopping atripla can seriously affect your response to future treatment. if atripla is stopped, speak to your doctor before you restart taking atripla tablets. your doctor may consider giving you the components of atripla separately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. when your supply of atripla starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. this is very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. the virus may then become harder to treat. if you have both hiv infection and hepatitis b, it is especially important not to stop your atripla treatment without talking to your doctor first. some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three components of atripla). if atripla is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis b treatment. you may require blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis b infection. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "atripla", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "this medicine", "Type": "TREATMENT",
