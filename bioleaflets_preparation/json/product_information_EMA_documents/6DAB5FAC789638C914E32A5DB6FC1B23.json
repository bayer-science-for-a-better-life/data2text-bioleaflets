NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nADYNOVI 250 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nADYNOVI 500 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nADYNOVI 1000 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nADYNOVI 2000 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nADYNOVI 250 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nEach vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), rurioctocog alfa pegol, \n\ncorresponding to a concentration of 50 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent.  \n\n \n\nADYNOVI 500 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), rurioctocog alfa pegol, \n\ncorresponding to a concentration of 100 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent.  \n\n \n\nADYNOVI 1000 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n\nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), rurioctocog alfa pegol, \n\ncorresponding to a concentration of 200 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent.  \n\n \n\nADYNOVI 2000 IU / 5 ml powder and solvent for solution for injection  \n\nEach vial contains nominally 2000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), rurioctocog alfa pegol, \n\ncorresponding to a concentration of 400 IU/ml after reconstitution with 5 ml solvent. \n\n \n\nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the chromogenic assay. The specific activity of \n\nADYNOVI is approximately 4000-6500 IU/mg protein. \n\n \n\nThe active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol is a covalent conjugate of the protein octocog alfa* with a \n\n20 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG).  \n\n \n\n* Human factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) \n\ncell line. \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect \n\nEach powder vial contains 0.45 mmol (10 mg) sodium, see section 4.4. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n\n \n\nPowder: White to off-white friable powder. \n\nSolvent: Clear and colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital \n\nfactor VIII deficiency). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.  \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated patients \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nTreatment monitoring \n\nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the \n\ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \n\nresponse to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \n\nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \n\ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \n\nanalysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  \n\nA field study has indicated that plasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic \n\nsubstrate assay or a one stage clotting assay routinely used in clinical laboratories. \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \n\non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n\n \n\nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \n\nrelated to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in \n\nplasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in \n\nInternational Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  \n\n \n\nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \n\nof normal human plasma. \n\n \n\nOn demand treatment  \n\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n\n1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required \n\ndose is determined using the following formula: \n\n \n\nRequired international units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n\n \n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \n\nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n\n \n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \n\nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period.  \n\n \n\nThe following Table 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/type \n\nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \n\nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \n\nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \n\nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n\n20 – 40 Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours. \n\nAt least 1 day, until the bleeding \n\nepisode, as indicated by pain, is \n\nresolved or healing is achieved. \n\n \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \n\nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n30 – 60 Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n\nfor 3 – 4 days or more until pain and \n\nacute disability are resolved. \n\n \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages. 60 – 100 Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor \n\nIncluding tooth extraction. \n\n30 – 60 Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until \n\nhealing is achieved. \n\n \n\nMajor 80 – 100 \n\n \n\n(pre- and postoperative) \n\nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil adequate wound healing, then \n\ncontinue therapy for at least \n\nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \n\nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \n\nProphylaxis  \n\n \n\nFor long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight \n\ntwice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be \n\nconsidered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nOn demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult \n\npatients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. The \n\nlong-term safety of ADYNOVI in children below 12 years has not yet been established. Adjustments \n\nof doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual \n\nbleeding tendency (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nADYNOVI is for intravenous use.  \n\nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \n\nof 10 ml/min. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to the parent molecule octocog alfa or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\nKnown allergic reaction to mouse or hamster protein. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity  \n\nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with ADYNOVI. The medicinal product contains \n\ntraces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be \n\nadvised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients \n\nshould be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised \n\nurticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  \n\n \n\nIn case of anaphylactic shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  \n\n \n\nInhibitors  \n\nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \n\nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \n\ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \n\nper ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the \n\nseverity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the \n\nfirst 20 exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.  \n\n \n\nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \n\nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \n\nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \n\ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  \n\n \n\nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \n\ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \n\ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n\n \n\nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \n\nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \n\nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \n\ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \n\ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \n\nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \n\nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n \n\nImmune tolerance induction (ITI) \n\nNo clinical data for use of ADYNOVI in ITI are available. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular events \n\nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase \n\nthe cardiovascular risk. \n\n \n\nCatheter-related complications in treatment \n\nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \n\nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\n \n\nExcipient related considerations \n\nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \n\ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\nName and batch number of the medicinal product \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time that ADYNOVI is administered to a patient, the name and \n\nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \n\nof the medicinal product. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \n\nbeen reported. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \n\nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \n\nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation \n\nonly if clearly indicated. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nADYNOVI has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \n\ninjection site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \n\nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \n\nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).  \n\n \n\nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \n\nwith factor VIII, including with ADYNOVI. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \n\nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \n\ncentre be contacted. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\nThe safety of ADYNOVI was evaluated in 243 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A \n\n(factor VIII less than 1% of normal), who received at least one dose of ADYNOVI in 3 completed \n\nmulti-center, prospective, open label clinical studies and 2 ongoing clinical studies. The median \n\nnumber of exposure days to ADYNOVI per subject was 103.5 (min-max: 1- 278).  \n\n \n\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (System Organ \n\nClass and Preferred Term Level).  \n\n \n\nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \n\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported for ADYNOVI  \n\nMedDRA \n\nStandard System Organ Class \n\nAdverse reactions \n\n \n\nFrequency per patient \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)* \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \n\nVascular disorders Flushing Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common \n\nNausea Common \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash Common \n\n* Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A.

The mean (SD) age \n\nwas 3.3 (1.55) and 8.1 (1.92) years respectively. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n\n \n\nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and \n\nvon Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophilic \n\npatient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII \n\nacts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. \n\nActivated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin \n\nand a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a X-chromosomal linked hereditary disorder of blood \n\ncoagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, \n\nmuscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By \n\nreplacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary \n\ncorrection of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nRurioctocog alfa pegol, is a pegylated recombinant human factor VIII with an extended half-life. \n\nRurioctocog alfa pegol is a covalent conjugate of octocog alfa consisting of 2,332 amino acids with \n\npolyethylene glycol (PEG) reagent (MW 20 kDa). The therapeutic activity of rurioctocog alfa pegol is \n\nderived from octocog alfa, which is produced by recombinant DNA technology from a Chinese \n\nhamster ovary cell line. Octocog alfa is then covalently conjugated with the PEG reagent. The PEG \n\nmoiety is conjugated to octocog alfa to increase the plasma half-life.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a pivotal multicenter, \n\nopen-label, prospective clinical trial that compared the efficacy of a twice weekly prophylactic \n\ntreatment regimen to on-demand treatment and determined haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of \n\nbleeding episodes. A total of 137 male PTPs (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A \n\nreceived at least one infusion with ADYNOVI. Twenty-five of the 137 subjects were adolescents \n\n(12 to less than 18 years of age). \n\n \n\nProphylactic treatment \n\nSubjects received either prophylactic treatment (n = 120) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 40-50 IU \n\nper kg twice weekly or on-demand treatment (n = 17) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 10-60 IU per kg \n\nfor a 6-month period. The median dosing interval was 3.6 days and the mean dose (SD) \n\nwas 48.7 (4.4) IU/kg. One hundred eighteen of 120 (98%) prophylaxis subjects remained on the \n\nstarting recommended regimen without dose adjustment, and 2 subjects increased their dose \n\nto 60 IU/kg during prophylaxis due to bleeding in target joints.  \n\n \n\nIn the per-protocol population, i.e. dosed according to the protocol specific dosing requirements, a \n\ntotal of 101 subjects received a twice a week regimen in the prophylaxis arm, and 17 subjects were \n\ntreated episodically in the on-demand arm. The median annualised bleed rate (ABR) in the on-demand \n\ntreatment arm was 41.5 compared to 1.9 while on a twice a week prophylaxis regimen. The median \n\njoint ABR (Q1 ; Q3) in the on-demand arm was 38.1 (24.5 ; 44.6) compared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.0) while on \n\nprophylaxis, and the median spontaneous ABR was 21.6 (11.2 ; 33.2) on the on-demand arm \n\ncompared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.2) while on prophylaxis. Results for the full-analysis population were similar \n\nto those for the per-protocol population. Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor \n\nconcentrates and between different clinical studies. \n\n \n\nForty out of 101 subjects (40%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) \n\nexperienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) experienced no spontaneous \n\nbleeding episodes in the prophylaxis arm. All subjects in the on-demand arm experienced a bleeding \n\nepisode, including a joint or spontaneous bleeding episode. \n\n \n\nTreatment of bleeding episodes \n\nA total of 518 bleeding episodes were treated with ADYNOVI in the per-protocol population. Of \n\nthese, 361 bleeding episodes (n=17 subjects) occurred in the on-demand arm and 157 (n=61 subjects) \n\noccurred in the prophylaxis arm. The median dose per infusion to treat all bleeding episodes in the \n\nper-protocol population was 32.0 (Interquartile Range (IQR): 21.5) IU per kg. Overall, 95.9% of \n\nbleeding episodes were controlled with 1 to 2 infusions and 85.5% were controlled with \n\nonly 1 infusion. Of the 518 bleeding episodes, 96.1% were rated excellent (full relief of pain and \n\ncessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or good (definite pain relief and/or \n\nimprovement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in their response to treatment with \n\nADYNOVI. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population < 12 years of age \n\nA total of 66 PTPs with severe haemophilia A were dosed (32 subjects aged < 6 years and 34 subjects \n\naged 6 to < 12 years) in the paediatric study. The prophylactic regimen was 40 to 60 IU/kg of \n\nADYNOVI twice a week. The mean dose (SD) was 54.3 (6.3) IU/kg and the median frequency of \n\ninfusions per week was 1.87. The median overall ABR was 2.0 (IQR: 3.9) for the 65 subjects in the \n\nper-protocol population and the median ABRs for spontaneous and joint bleeding episodes were \n\nboth 0 (IQR: 1.9). Twenty four out of 65 subjects (37%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 47 out \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nof 65 subjects (72%) experienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 43 out of 65 subjects (66%) \n\nexperienced no spontaneous bleeding episodes on prophylaxis. \n\n \n\nOf the 70 bleeding episodes observed during the paediatric study, 82.9% were controlled \n\nwith 1 infusion and 91.4% were controlled with 1 or 2 infusions. Control of bleeding was rated \n\nexcellent (full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or \n\ngood (definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in 63 out \n\nof 70 (90.0%) bleeding episodes.  \n\n \n\nPerioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) \n\nA total of 21 major surgical procedures and 5 additional minor surgeries were performed and assessed \n\nin 21 unique subjects in the surgery study. For major surgeries, the preoperative loading dose ranged \n\nfrom 36 IU/kg to 109 IU/kg (median: 63 IU/kg); and postoperative total dose ranged from 186 IU/kg \n\nto 1320 IU/kg (median: 490 IU/kg). The median total dose for major surgeries was 553 IU/kg \n\n(range: 248-1394 IU/kg) and the median total dose of minor surgeries was 106 IU/kg (range: 76-\n\n132 IU/kg). \n\n \n\nPerioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent (blood loss less than or equal to that \n\nexpected for the same type of procedure performed in a non-haemophilic patient, and required blood \n\ncomponents for transfusions less than or similar to that expected in non-haemophilic population) for \n\nall 26 (21 major, 5 minor) procedures. The median (IQR) observed intraoperative blood loss (n = 14) \n\nwas 10.0 (20.0) ml compared to the predicted average blood loss (n = 14) of 150.0 (140.0) ml for \n\nmajor orthopaedic surgeries. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit results of studies with \n\nADYNOVI in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of congenital \n\nfactor VIII deficiency. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a crossover study with octocog alfa \n\nin 26 subjects (18 adults and 8 adolescents) and in 22 subjects (16 adults and 6 adolescents) \n\nafter 6 months of treatment with ADYNOVI. Plasma factor VIII activity was measured by the \n\none stage clotting assay and chromogenic assay. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI has an extended half-life of 1.4 to 1.5-fold compared to recombinant human coagulation \n\nfactor VIII (octocog alfa) in the adolescent and adult population, as determined based on one stage \n\nclotting and chromogenic assays, respectively. An increase in AUC and a decrease in clearance as \n\ncompared to the parent molecule, octocog alfa, were also observed. Incremental recovery was \n\ncomparable with both products. The change in PK parameters was similar in both the adult and \n\nadolescent populations and between one-stage clotting and chromogenic substrate assays. \n\n \n\nPaediatric pharmacokinetics \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters calculated from 39 subjects less than 18 years of age (intent-to-treat \n\nanalysis) are available for 14 children (2 to less than 6 years), 17 older children (6 to less \n\nthan 12 years) and 8 adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age). The half-life extension in the \n\npaediatric population was 1.3 to 1.5 fold using both the one stage clotting and chromogenic assays. \n\nThe mean clearance (based on body weight) of ADYNOVI was higher and the mean half-life was \n\nlower in children less than 12 years of age than adults.  \n\nA higher dose may be required in children less than 12 years of age, see section 4.2.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nTable 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters using the chromogenic assay \n\n(Arithmetic mean ± SD) \n\nPK parameters \n\nADYNOVI \n\nAdults \n\n(18 years and \n\nolder) \n\nN = 18 \n\nDose:  \n\n45 ± 5 IU/kg \n\nADYNOVI \n\nAdolescents \n\n(12-<18 years) \n\nN = 8 \n\nDose:  \n\n45 ± 5 IU/kg \n\nADYNOVI \n\nPaediatric \n\npatients \n\n(6-<12 years) \n\nN = 17 \n\nDose:  \n\n50 ± 10 IU/kg \n\nADYNOVI \n\nPaediatric \n\npatients \n\n(< 6 years) \n\nN = 14 \n\nDose:  \n\n50 ± 10 IU/kg \n\nDesign Individual PK with full samplinga Population PK with sparse sampling\nb \n\nTerminal \n\nhalf--life [h] \n15.01 ± 3.89 13.80 ± 4.01 11.93 ± 2.58 12.99 ± 8.75 \n\nMRT [h] 19.70 ± 5.05 17.73 ± 5.44 17.24 ± 3.73 18.74 ± 12.60 \n\nCL [mL/(kg·h)]d 2.16 ± 0.75 2.58 ± 0.84 2.80 ± 0.67 3.49 ± 1.21 \n\nIncremental \n\nrecovery \n\n[(IU/dL)/(IU/kg)] \n\n2.87 ± 0.61 2.34 ± 0.62 \nnac \n\n(2.19± 0.40) \n\nnac \n\n(1.90 ± 0.27) \n\nAUC0-Inf \n\n[IU·h/dL] \n2589 ± 848 1900 ± 841 2259 ± 514 2190 ± 1593 \n\nVss [dL/kg] 0.40 ± 0.09 0.54 ± 0.22 0.46 ± 0.04 0.54 ± 0.03 \n\nCmax [IU/dL] 145 ± 29 117 ± 28 \nnac \n\n(130 ± 24) \n\nnac \n\n(117 ± 16) \n\nAbbreviations: Cmax: maximum observed activity; AUC: area under the curve; MRT: mean residence \n\ntime; CL: clearance; Vss: body weight adjusted volume of distribution at steady-state,  \na Individual PK with 12 post-infusion samples. \nb Population PK model with 3 post-infusion samples based on randomized drawing schedule. \nc NA, Not applicable, as Incremental Recovery and Cmax in children were determined by individual \n\nPK.

The human \n\nrelevance of kidney vacuolation observed in the preclinical study is unknown. \n\n \n\nNonclinical data are limited to 1 month exposure and no studies in juvenile animals were conducted \n\nwith ADYNOVI. Thus it was not possible to conclude on the potential risks of PEG accumulation in \n\nvarious tissues/organs relevant for chronic use of ADYNOVI in the paediatric population.  \n\nNo studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity have been performed with \n\nADYNOVI. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Solutions that \n\nare cloudy or have deposits should not be used.  \n\nAfter reconstitution, the solution has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3. The osmolality is ≥ 380 mOsmol/kg. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nPreparation and reconstitution using the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device \n\nFor reconstitution use only the solvent vial and the reconstitution device provided in the pack. \n\n1. Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the \n\nreconstitution procedure. \n\n2. Allow the vials of powder and solvent to reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C) \n\nbefore use. \n\n3. Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials. \n\n4. Clean rubber stoppers with an alcohol wipe and allow to dry prior to use. \n\n5. Open the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device package by peeling away the lid, without touching the \n\ninside (Figure A). Do not remove the device from the package. \n\n6. Turn the package over. Press straight down to fully insert the clear plastic spike through the \n\nsolvent vial stopper (Figure B).  \n\n7. Grip the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow package at its edge and pull the package off the device \n\n(Figure C). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device. Do not touch \n\nthe exposed purple plastic spike. \n\n8. Turn the system over so that the solvent vial is on top. Quickly insert the purple plastic spike \n\nfully into the powder vial stopper by pushing straight down (Figure D). The vacuum will draw \n\nthe solvent into the powder vial. \n\n9. Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution. \n\n \n\nFigure A Figure B Figure C \n\n   \nFigure D Figure E Figure F \n\n   \n \n\nAdministration \n\n• Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \nadministration.  \n\no The appearance of the reconstituted solution is clear and colourless.  \no Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. \n\n• Administer as soon as possible, but no later than 3 hours after reconstitution.  \n \n\nAdministration Steps: \n\n \n\n1. Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device (Figure E). Do not draw air into \n\nthe syringe. Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is \n\nrecommended.  \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n2. Turn the system upside down (powder vial now on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the \n\nsyringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Figure F).  \n\n3. Disconnect the syringe; attach a suitable needle and inject intravenously. If a patient is to \n\nreceive more than one vial of ADYNOVI, the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the \n\nsame syringe.  \n\nA separate BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device is required to reconstitute each vial of ADYNOVI with \n\nthe solvent. \n\n4. Administer over a period of up to 5 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 ml per min).  \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADYNOVI is administered, the name and batch number of \n\nthe product are recorded. Peel-off labels are provided on the powder vial. \n\n \n\nReconstitution with the BAXJECT III system \n\nDo not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister \n\n \n\n1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent \n\nvials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room \n\ntemperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n\n3. Open the ADYNOVI blister by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from \n\nthe blister. \n\n4. Place the powder vial on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Figure 1). The solvent vial \n\nhas a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. \n\n5. With one hand holding the powder vial in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the \n\nsolvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down \n\ninto the powder vial (Figure 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. \n\n6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved \n\n(Figure 3). Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted \n\nsolution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less \n\nthan 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from \n\nparticles. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 \n\n   \n \n\nAdministration \n\n• Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \nadministration.  \n\no The appearance of the reconstituted solution is clear and colourless.  \no Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. \n\n• Administer as soon as possible, but no later than 3 hours after reconstitution.  \n \n\nAdministration Steps: \n\n \n\n1. Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT III device. Do not draw air into the syringe. \n\nConnect the syringe to the BAXJECT III device. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is recommended.  \n\n2.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital \n\nfactor VIII deficiency). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.  \n\n \n\nPreviously untreated patients \n\nThe safety and efficacy of ADYNOVI in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. \n\nNo data are available. \n\n \n\nTreatment monitoring: \n\nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the \n\ndose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their \n\nresponse to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight \n\nmay require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical \n\ninterventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation \n\nanalysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.  \n\nA field study has indicated that plasma factor VIII levels can be monitored using either a chromogenic \n\nsubstrate assay or a one stage clotting assay routinely used in clinical laboratories. \n\n \n\nPosology  \n\nThe dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, \n\non the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n\n \n\nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \n\nrelated to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in \n\nplasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in \n\nInternational Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).  \n\n \n\nOne International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml \n\nof normal human plasma. \n\n \n\nOn demand treatment  \n\nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that \n\n1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required \n\ndose is determined using the following formula: \n\n \n\nRequired international units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 \n\n \n\nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \n\nclinical effectiveness in the individual case. \n\n \n\nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given \n\nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period.  \n\n \n\nThe following Table 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nTable 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/type \n\nof surgical procedure \n\nFactor VIII level \n\nrequired (% or IU/dl) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/duration \n\nof therapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage   \n\nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \n\nbleeding or oral bleeding. \n\n20 – 40 Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours. \n\nAt least 1 day, until the bleeding \n\nepisode, as indicated by pain, is \n\nresolved or healing is achieved. \n\n \n\nMore extensive haemarthrosis, \n\nmuscle bleeding or haematoma \n\n30 – 60 Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours \n\nfor 3 – 4 days or more until pain and \n\nacute disability are resolved. \n\n \n\nLife threatening haemorrhages. 60 – 100 Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil threat is resolved. \n\nSurgery   \n\nMinor \n\nIncluding tooth extraction. \n\n30 – 60 Every 24 hours at least 1 day, until \n\nhealing is achieved. \n\n \n\nMajor 80 – 100 \n\n \n\n(pre- and postoperative) \n\nRepeat injections every 8 to 24 hours \n\nuntil adequate wound healing, then \n\ncontinue therapy for at least \n\nanother 7 days to maintain a factor VIII \n\nactivity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl). \n\n \n\nProphylaxis  \n\n \n\nFor long term prophylaxis, the recommended dose is 40 to 50 IU of ADYNOVI per kg bodyweight \n\ntwice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be \n\nconsidered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency (see section 5.2). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population  \n\n \n\nOn demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult \n\npatients. Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. The \n\nlong-term safety of ADYNOVI in children below 12 years has not yet been established. Adjustments \n\nof doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual \n\nbleeding tendency (see section 5.2).  \n\n \n\nMethod of administration  \n\n \n\nADYNOVI is for intravenous use \n\nThe rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum \n\nof 10 ml/min. \n\n \n\nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to the parent molecule octocog alfa or to any of the excipients \n\nlisted in section 6.1.  \n\n \n\nKnown allergic reaction to mouse or hamster protein. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity  \n\nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with ADYNOVI. The medicinal product contains \n\ntraces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be \n\nadvised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients \n\nshould be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised \n\nurticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  \n\n \n\nIn case of anaphylactic shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  \n\n \n\nInhibitors  \n\nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \n\nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \n\ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \n\nper ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the \n\nseverity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the \n\nfirst 20 exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.  \n\n \n\nCases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII \n\nproduct to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a \n\nprevious history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients \n\ncarefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  \n\n \n\nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \n\ninhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of \n\ninsufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n\n \n\nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \n\nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected \n\nfactor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate \n\ndose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of \n\ninhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. \n\nManagement of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of \n\nhaemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n\n \n\nImmune tolerance induction (ITI) \n\nNo clinical data for use of ADYNOVI in ITI are available. \n\n \n\nCardiovascular events \n\nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase \n\nthe cardiovascular risk. \n\n \n\nCatheter-related complications in treatment \n\nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \n\nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\n \n\nExcipient related considerations \n\nAfter reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. To be taken \n\ninto consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\nName and batch number of the medicinal product \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time that ADYNOVI is administered to a patient, the name and \n\nbatch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch \n\nof the medicinal product. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\nPaediatric population  \n\nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \n\nbeen reported. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \n\nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and \n\nbreast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation \n\nonly if clearly indicated. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nADYNOVI has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \n\ninjection site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \n\nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed \n\nrarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).  \n\n \n\nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \n\nwith factor VIII, including with ADYNOVI. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself \n\nas an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia \n\ncentre be contacted. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n\nThe safety of ADYNOVI was evaluated in 243 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A \n\n(factor VIII less than 1% of normal), who received at least one dose of ADYNOVI in 3 completed \n\nmulti-center, prospective, open label clinical studies and 2 ongoing clinical studies. The median \n\nnumber of exposure days to ADYNOVI per subject was 103.5 (min-max: 1-278).  \n\n \n\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (System Organ \n\nClass and Preferred Term Level).  \n\n \n\nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); \n\ncommon (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n\n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \n\ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported for ADYNOVI  \n\nMedDRA \n\nStandard System Organ Class \n\nAdverse reactions \n\n \n\nFrequency per patient \n\n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Factor VIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)* \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon \n\nNervous system disorders Headache Common \n\nVascular disorders Flushing Uncommon \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoea Common \n\nNausea Common \n\nSkin and tubcutaneous Tissue disorders Rash Common \n\n* Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe \n\nhaemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients. \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nThe observed event of hypersensitivity was a mild transient non-serious rash, occurring in \n\none 2-year-old patient who had developed a previous rash while on ADYNOVI. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n\nThe safety of ADYNOVI was evaluated in 38 subjects < 6 years and 34 subjects 6 to < 12 years of age \n\nhaving accumulated a total of 2880 EDs and 2975 EDs respectively. The mean (SD) age \n\nwas 3.3 (1.55) and 8.1 (1.92) years respectively. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nNo symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n\n \n\nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and \n\nvon Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophilic \n\npatient, factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII \n\nacts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. \n\nActivated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin \n\nand a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a X-chromosomal linked hereditary disorder of blood \n\ncoagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, \n\nmuscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By \n\nreplacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary \n\ncorrection of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nRurioctocog alfa pegol, is a pegylated recombinant human factor VIII with an extended half-life. \n\nRurioctocog alfa pegol is a covalent conjugate of octocog alfa consisting of 2,332 amino acids with \n\npolyethylene glycol (PEG) reagent (MW 20 kDa). The therapeutic activity of rurioctocog alfa pegol is \n\nderived from octocog alfa, which is produced by recombinant DNA technology from a Chinese \n\nhamster ovary cell line. Octocog alfa is then covalently conjugated with the PEG reagent. The PEG \n\nmoiety is conjugated to octocog alfa to increase the plasma half-life.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nThe safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a pivotal multicenter, \n\nopen-label, prospective clinical trial that compared the efficacy of a twice weekly prophylactic \n\ntreatment regimen to on-demand treatment and determined haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of \n\nbleeding episodes. A total of 137 male PTPs (12 to 65 years of age) with severe haemophilia A \n\nreceived at least one infusion with ADYNOVI. Twenty-five of the 137 subjects were adolescents \n\n(12 to less than 18 years of age). \n\n \n\nProphylactic treatment \n\nSubjects received either prophylactic treatment (n = 120) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 40-50 IU \n\nper kg twice weekly or on-demand treatment (n = 17) with ADYNOVI at a dose of 10-60 IU per kg \n\nfor a 6-month period. The median dosing interval was 3.6 days and the mean dose (SD) \n\nwas 48.7 (4.4) IU/kg. One hundred eighteen of 120 (98%) prophylaxis subjects remained on the \n\nstarting recommended regimen without dose adjustment, and 2 subjects increased their dose \n\nto 60 IU/kg during prophylaxis due to bleeding in target joints.  \n\n \n\nIn the per-protocol population, i.e. dosed according to the protocol specific dosing requirements, a \n\ntotal of 101 subjects received a twice a week regimen in the prophylaxis arm, and 17 subjects were \n\ntreated episodically in the on-demand arm. The median annualised bleed rate (ABR) in the on-demand \n\ntreatment arm was 41.5 compared to 1.9 while on a twice a week prophylaxis regimen. The median \n\njoint ABR (Q1 ; Q3) in the on-demand arm was 38.1 (24.5 ; 44.6) compared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.0) while on \n\nprophylaxis, and the median spontaneous ABR was 21.6 (11.2 ; 33.2) on the on-demand arm \n\ncompared to 0.0 (0.0 ; 2.2) while on prophylaxis. Results for the full-analysis population were similar \n\nto those for the per-protocol population. Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor \n\nconcentrates and between different clinical studies. \n\n \n\nForty out of 101 subjects (40%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) \n\nexperienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) experienced no spontaneous \n\nbleeding episodes in the prophylaxis arm. All subjects in the on-demand arm experienced a bleeding \n\nepisode, including a joint or spontaneous bleeding episode. \n\n \n\nTreatment of bleeding episodes \n\nA total of 518 bleeding episodes were treated with ADYNOVI in the per-protocol population. Of \n\nthese, 361 bleeding episodes (n=17 subjects) occurred in the on-demand arm and 157 (n=61 subjects) \n\noccurred in the prophylaxis arm. The median dose per infusion to treat all bleeding episodes in the \n\nper-protocol population was 32.0 (Interquartile Range (IQR): 21.5) IU per kg. Overall, 95.9% of \n\nbleeding episodes were controlled with 1 to 2 infusions and 85.5% were controlled with \n\nonly 1 infusion. Of the 518 bleeding episodes, 96.1% were rated excellent (full relief of pain and \n\ncessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or good (definite pain relief and/or \n\nimprovement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in their response to treatment with \n\nADYNOVI. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population < 12 years of age \n\nA total of 66 PTPs with severe haemophilia A were dosed (32 subjects aged < 6 years and 34 subjects \n\naged 6 to < 12 years) in the paediatric study. The prophylactic regimen was 40 to 60 IU/kg of \n\nADYNOVI twice a week. The mean dose (SD) was 54.3 (6.3) IU/kg and the median frequency of \n\ninfusions per week was 1.87. The median overall ABR was 2.0 (IQR: 3.9) for the 65 subjects in the \n\nper-protocol population and the median ABRs for spontaneous and joint bleeding episodes were \n\nboth 0 (IQR: 1.9). Twenty four out of 65 subjects (37%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 47 out \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nof 65 subjects (72%) experienced no joint bleeding episodes, and 43 out of 65 subjects (66%) \n\nexperienced no spontaneous bleeding episodes on prophylaxis. \n\n \n\nOf the 70 bleeding episodes observed during the paediatric study, 82.9% were controlled \n\nwith 1 infusion and 91.4% were controlled with 1 or 2 infusions. Control of bleeding was rated \n\nexcellent (full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or \n\ngood (definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in 63 out \n\nof 70 (90.0%) bleeding episodes.  \n\n \n\nPerioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) \n\nA total of 21 major surgical procedures and 5 additional minor surgeries were performed and assessed \n\nin 21 unique subjects in the surgery study. For major surgeries, the preoperative loading dose ranged \n\nfrom 36 IU/kg to 109 IU/kg (median: 63 IU/kg); and postoperative total dose ranged from 186 IU/kg \n\nto 1320 IU/kg (median: 490 IU/kg). The median total dose for major surgeries was 553 IU/kg \n\n(range: 248-1394 IU/kg) and the median total dose of minor surgeries was 106 IU/kg (range: 76-\n\n132 IU/kg). \n\n \n\nPerioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent (blood loss less than or equal to that \n\nexpected for the same type of procedure performed in a non-haemophilic patient, and required blood \n\ncomponents for transfusions less than or similar to that expected in non-haemophilic population) for \n\nall 26 (21 major, 5 minor) procedures. The median (IQR) observed intraoperative blood loss (n = 14) \n\nwas 10.0 (20.0) ml compared to the predicted average blood loss (n = 14) of 150.0 (140.0) ml for \n\nmajor orthopaedic surgeries. \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit results of studies with \n\nADYNOVI in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of congenital \n\nfactor VIII deficiency. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADYNOVI were evaluated in a crossover study with octocog alfa \n\nin 26 subjects (18 adults and 8 adolescents) and in 22 subjects (16 adults and 6 adolescents) \n\nafter 6 months of treatment with ADYNOVI. Plasma factor VIII activity was measured by the \n\none stage clotting assay and chromogenic assay. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI has an extended half-life of 1.4 to 1.5-fold compared to recombinant human coagulation \n\nfactor VIII (octocog alfa) in the adolescent and adult population, as determined based on one stage \n\nclotting and chromogenic assays, respectively. An increase in AUC and a decrease in clearance as \n\ncompared to the parent molecule, octocog alfa, were also observed. Incremental recovery was \n\ncomparable with both products. The change in PK parameters was similar in both the adult and \n\nadolescent populations and between one-stage clotting and chromogenic substrate assays. \n\n \n\nPaediatric Pharmacokinetics \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters calculated from 39 subjects less than 18 years of age (intent-to-treat \n\nanalysis) are available for 14 children (2 to less than 6 years), 17 older children (6 to less \n\nthan 12 years) and 8 adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years of age). The half-life extension in the \n\npaediatric population was 1.3 to 1.5 fold using both the one stage clotting and chromogenic assays. \n\nThe mean clearance (based on body weight) of ADYNOVI was higher and the mean half-life was \n\nlower in children less than 12 years of age than adults.  \n\nA higher dose may be required in children less than 12 years of age, see section 4.2.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nTable 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters using the chromogenic assay \n\n(Arithmetic mean ± SD) \n\nPK parameters \n\nADYNOVI \n\nAdults \n\n(18 years and \n\nolder) \n\nN = 18 \n\nDose:  \n\n45 ± 5 IU/kg \n\nADYNOVI \n\nAdolescents \n\n(12-<18 years) \n\nN = 8 \n\nDose:  \n\n45 ± 5 IU/kg \n\nADYNOVI \n\nPaediatric \n\npatients \n\n(6-<12 years) \n\nN = 17 \n\nDose:  \n\n50 ± 10 IU/kg \n\nADYNOVI \n\nPaediatric \n\npatients \n\n(< 6 years) \n\nN = 14 \n\nDose:  \n\n50 ± 10 IU/kg \n\nDesign Individual PK with full samplinga Population PK with sparse sampling\nb \n\nTerminal \n\nhalf--life [h] \n15.01 ± 3.89 \n\n13.80 ± 4.01 11.93 ± 2.58 12.99 ± 8.75 \n\nMRT [h] 19.70 ± 5.05 17.73 ± 5.44 17.24 ± 3.73 18.74 ± 12.60 \n\nCL [mL/(kg·h)]d 2.16 ± 0.75 2.58 ± 0.84 2.80 ± 0.67 3.49 ± 1.21 \n\nIncremental \n\nrecovery \n\n[(IU/dL)/(IU/kg)] \n\n2.87 ± 0.61 2.34 ± 0.62 nac \n\n(2.19± 0.40) \n\nnac \n\n(1.90 ± 0.27) \n\nAUC0-Inf \n\n[IU·h/dL] \n\n2589 ± 848 1900 ± 841 2259 ± 514 2190 ± 1593 \n\nVss [dL/kg] 0.40 ± 0.09 0.54 ± 0.22 0.46 ± 0.04 0.54 ± 0.03 \n\nCmax [IU/dL] \n145 ± 29 117 ± 28 nac \n\n(130 ± 24) \n\nnac \n\n(117 ± 16) \n\nAbbreviations: Cmax: maximum observed activity; AUC: area under the curve; MRT: mean residence \n\ntime; CL: clearance; Vss: body weight adjusted volume of distribution at steady-state,  \na Individual PK with 12 post-infusion samples. \nb Population PK model with 3 post-infusion samples based on randomized drawing schedule. \nc NA, Not applicable, as Incremental Recovery and Cmax in children were determined by individual \n\nPK.

The human \n\nrelevance of kidney vacuolation observed in the preclinical study is unknown. \n\n \n\nNonclinical data are limited to 1 month exposure and no studies in juvenile animals were conducted \n\nwith ADYNOVI. Thus it was not possible to conclude on the potential risks of PEG accumulation in \n\nvarious tissues/organs relevant for chronic use of ADYNOVI in the paediatric population No studies \n\non genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity have been performed with ADYNOVI. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

The end of the 3-month storage at room temperature should be recorded on the product \n\ncarton. This date should never exceed the one initially mentioned on the outer carton. At the end of \n\nthis period the product shall not be put back in the refrigerator, but shall be used or discarded. \n\n \n\nAfter reconstitution \n\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 3 hours at a temperature not \n\nabove 30° C. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the \n\nrisk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, \n\nin-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. Do not refrigerate. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n\n \n\nStore refrigerated (2°to 8° C). \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nADYNOVI with BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device: Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect \n\nfrom light. \n\nADYNOVI in BAXJECT III system: Keep the sealed blister in the outer carton in order to protect \n\nfrom light. \n\n \n\nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n\n \n\nType I glass vial, closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper, containing 250 IU, 500 IU, or 1000 IU of \n\npowder. \n\nType I glass vial, closed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper, containing 2 ml of sterilised water for \n\ninjections. \n\nThe medicinal product is provided in one of the following configurations: \n\n \n\n- ADYNOVI with BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device: Each pack contains a powder vial, a solvent vial \nand a device for reconstitution (BAXJECT II Hi-Flow). \n\n- ADYNOVI in BAXJECT III system: Each pack contains a ready to use BAXJECT III system in \na sealed blister, withthe powder vial and the solvent vial preassembled for reconstitution. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n\n \n\nThe reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \n\ndiscoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Solutions that \n\nare cloudy or have deposits should not be used.  \n\nAfter reconstitution, the solution has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3. The osmolality is ≥ 380 mOsmol/kg. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nPreparation and reconstitution using the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device: \n\nFor reconstitution use only the solvent vial and the reconstitution device provided in the pack. \n\n1. Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the \n\nreconstitution procedure. \n\n2. Allow the vials of powder and solvent to reach room temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C) \n\nbefore use. \n\n3. Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials. \n\n4. Clean rubber stoppers with an alcohol wipe and allow to dry prior to use. \n\n5. Open the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device package by peeling away the lid, without touching the \n\ninside (Figure A). Do not remove the device from the package. \n\n6. Turn the package over. Press straight down to fully insert the clear plastic spike through the \n\nsolvent vial stopper (Figure B).  \n\n7. Grip the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow package at its edge and pull the package off the device \n\n(Figure C). Do not remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device. Do not touch \n\nthe exposed purple plastic spike. \n\n8. Turn the system over so that the solvent vial is on top. Quickly insert the purple plastic spike \n\nfully into the powder vial stopper by pushing straight down (Figure D). The vacuum will draw \n\nthe solvent into the powder vial. \n\n9. Swirl gently until the powder is completely dissolved. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution. \n\n \n\nFigure A Figure B Figure C \n\n   \nFigure D Figure E Figure F \n\n   \n \n\nAdministration \n\n• Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \nadministration.  \n\no The appearance of the reconstituted solution is clear and colourless.  \no Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. \n\n• Administer as soon as possible, but no later than 3 hours after reconstitution.  \n \n\nAdministration Steps: \n\n \n\n1. Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device (Figure E). Do not draw air into \n\nthe syringe. Connect the syringe to the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is \n\nrecommended.  \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n2. Turn the system upside down (powder vial now on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the \n\nsyringe by pulling the plunger back slowly (Figure F).  \n\n3. Disconnect the syringe; attach a suitable needle and inject intravenously. If a patient is to \n\nreceive more than one vial of ADYNOVI, the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the \n\nsame syringe.  \n\nA separate BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device is required to reconstitute each vial of ADYNOVI with \n\nthe solvent. \n\n4. Administer over a period of up to 5 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 ml per min).  \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADYNOVI is administered, the name and batch number of \n\nthe product are recorded. Peel-off labels are provided on the powder vial. \n\n \n\nReconstitution with the BAXJECT III system \n\nDo not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister \n\n \n\n1. If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent \n\nvials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room \n\ntemperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C). \n\n2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. \n\n3. Open the ADYNOVI blister by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from \n\nthe blister. \n\n4. Place the powder vial on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Figure 1). The solvent vial \n\nhas a blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step. \n\n5. With one hand holding the powder vial in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the \n\nsolvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down \n\ninto the powder vial (Figure 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete. \n\n6. Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved \n\n(Figure 3). Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted \n\nsolution will pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less \n\nthan 1 minute). After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from \n\nparticles. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 \n\n   \n \n\nAdministration \n\n• Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \nadministration.  \n\no The appearance of the reconstituted solution is clear and colourless.  \no Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. \n\n• Administer as soon as possible, but no later than 3 hours after reconstitution.  \n \n\nAdministration Steps: \n\n \n\n1. Remove the blue cap from the BAXJECT III device. Do not draw air into the syringe. \n\nConnect the syringe to the BAXJECT III device. Use of a Luer-lock syringe is recommended. \n\n2. Turn the system upside down (powder vial now on top). Draw the reconstituted solution into the \n\nsyringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.  \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\n3. Disconnect the syringe; attach a suitable needle and inject intravenously. If a patient is to \n\nreceive more than one vial of ADYNOVI, the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the \n\nsame syringe.  \n\n4. Administer over a period of up to 5 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 ml per min).  \n\n \n\nIt is strongly recommended that every time ADYNOVI is administered, the name and batch number of \n\nthe product are recorded. Peel-off labels are provided on the blister. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI \n\n3. How to use ADYNOVI \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store ADYNOVI \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What ADYNOVI is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol, pegylated human coagulation \n\nfactor VIII. The human coagulation factor VIII has been modified to prolong its duration of action. \n\nFactor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A \n\n(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with \n\nhaemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI  \n\n \n\nDo not use ADYNOVI: \n\n- if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \n\nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI. \n\n \n\nThere is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \n\nreaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\nhives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, \n\ntightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms \n\nof anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and \n\nextreme difficulty in breathing. \n\nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe \n\nsymptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood \n\nclotting (coagulation) complications. \n\n \n\nPatients developing factor VIII inhibitors \n\nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \n\nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \n\nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \n\nyou or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nCatheter-related complications  \n\nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including \n\nlocal infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and \n\nprecautions also apply to adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and ADYNOVI \n\nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. \n\nTherefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during preganancy and breast-feeding is \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nADYNOVI has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. This should be taken into consideration \n\nby patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use ADYNOVI \n\n \n\nTreatment with ADYNOVI will be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care \n\nof patients with haemophilia A. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVI depending on your condition and body weight, \n\nand on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will \n\ndepend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with \n\nADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nPrevention of bleeding \n\nThe usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n\nTreatment of bleeding \n\nThe dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \n\nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n\nIf you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \n\nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII \n\nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents \n\nis also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. \n\n \n\nHow ADYNOVI is given \n\nADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone \n\nelse might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. \n\nDetailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you use more ADYNOVI than you should \n\nAlways use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \n\nare not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use ADYNOVI \n\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \n\nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using ADYNOVI \n\nDo not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \n\nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \n\nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n\n \n\n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \n\nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nFor patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) \n\ninhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form uncommonly (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens \n\nyour medicine may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this \n\nhappens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\nHeadache, nausea, diarrhoea, rash \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\nFlushing, allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n\n150 days of treatment)) \n\n \n\nAdditional side effects in children \n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \n\nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \n\nyou or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nCatheter-related complications  \n\nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including \n\nlocal infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and \n\nprecautions also apply to adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and ADYNOVI \n\nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophilia A occurs only rarely in women. \n\nTherefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during preganancy and breast-feeding is \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nADYNOVI has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. This should be taken into consideration \n\nby patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use ADYNOVI \n\n \n\nTreatment with ADYNOVI will be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care \n\nof patients with haemophilia A. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVI depending on your condition and body weight, \n\nand on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will \n\ndepend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with \n\nADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n\nPrevention of bleeding \n\nThe usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. \n\n \n\nTreatment of bleeding \n\nThe dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \n\nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n\nIf you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \n\nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII \n\nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents \n\nis also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. \n\n \n\nHow ADYNOVI is given \n\nADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone \n\nelse might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. \n\nDetailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you use more ADYNOVI than you should \n\nAlways use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \n\nare not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use ADYNOVI \n\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \n\nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using ADYNOVI \n\nDo not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \n\nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \n\nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n\n \n\n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \n\nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nFor patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) \n\ninhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form uncommonly (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens \n\nyour medicine may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this \n\nhappens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\nHeadache, nausea, diarrhoea, rash \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\nFlushing, allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n\nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n\n150 days of treatment)) \n\n \n\nAdditional side effects in children \n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.

What ADYNOVI is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol, pegylated human coagulation \n\nfactor VIII. The human coagulation factor VIII has been modified to prolong its duration of action. \n\nFactor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A \n\n(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with \n\nhaemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI \n\n \n\nDo not use ADYNOVI: \n\n- if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \n\nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI.  \n\n \n\nThere is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \n\nreaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, \n\nhives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\ntightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms \n\nof anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and \n\nextreme difficulty in breathing. \n\nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe \n\nsymptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood \n\nclotting (coagulation) complications. \n\n \n\nPatients developing factor VIII inhibitors \n\nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \n\nall Factor VIII medicines.

What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI \n\n3. How to use ADYNOVI \n\n4. Possible side effects  \n\n5. How to store ADYNOVI \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What ADYNOVI is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nADYNOVI contains the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol, pegylated human coagulation \n\nfactor VIII. The human coagulation factor VIII has been modified to prolong its duration of action. \n\nFactor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. In patients with haemophilia A \n\n(inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients from 12 years of age with \n\nhaemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII). \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use ADYNOVI \n\n \n\nDo not use ADYNOVI: \n\n- if you are allergic to rurioctocog alfa pegol, octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this \nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins \n \n\nIf you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor before using ADYNOVI.  \n\n \n\nThere is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \n\nreaction) to ADYNOVI. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, \n\nhives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n\ntightness in the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms \n\nof anaphylactic shock; additional symptoms may include extreme dizziness, loss of consciousness, and \n\nextreme difficulty in breathing. \n\nIf any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe \n\nsymptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment. \n\n \n\nIf you suffer from cardiac disease, please inform your doctor, as there is an increased risk of blood \n\nclotting (coagulation) complications. \n\n \n\nPatients developing factor VIII inhibitors \n\nThe formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with \n\nall Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working \n\nproperly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If \n\nyou or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with ADYNOVI, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nCatheter-related complications  \n\nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including \n\nlocal infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The listed warnings and \n\nprecautions also apply to adolescents. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and ADYNOVI \n\nTell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. Haemophila A occurs only rarely in women. \n\nTherefore no experience regarding the use of ADYNOVI during preganancy and breast-feeding is \n\navailable. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nADYNOVI has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines. \n\n \n\nADYNOVI contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial. This should be taken into consideration \n\nby patients on a controlled sodium diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use ADYNOVI \n\n \n\nTreatment with ADYNOVI will be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care \n\nof patients with haemophilia A. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will calculate your dose of ADYNOVIdepending on your condition and body weight, and \n\non whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The frequency of administration will \n\ndepend on how well ADYNOVI is working for you. Usually, the replacement therapy with \n\nADYNOVI is a life-long treatment. \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nPrevention of bleeding \n\nThe usual dose of ADYNOVI is 40 to 50 IU per kg body weight, administered 2 times per week. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\nTreatment of bleeding \n\nThe dose of ADYNOVI is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be \n\nachieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n\nIf you think that the effect of ADYNOVI is insufficient, talk to your doctor. \n\nYour doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII \n\nlevels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. \n\n \n\nUse in children and adolescents \n\nADYNOVI can be used only in adolescents and adults (12 years and above). The dose in adolescents \n\nis also calculated to body weight and is the same dose as for adults. \n\n \n\nHow ADYNOVI is given \n\nADYNOVI is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone \n\nelse might also administer ADYNOVI as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. \n\nDetailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you use more ADYNOVI than you should \n\nAlways use ADYNOVI exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you \n\nare not sure. If you inject more ADYNOVI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use ADYNOVI \n\nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as \n\nscheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using ADYNOVI \n\nDo not stop using ADYNOVI without consulting your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped \n\nimmediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early \n\nsymptoms of allergic reactions: \n\n \n\n- rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, \n- swelling of lips and tongue, \n- difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, \n- general feeling of being unwell, \n- dizziness and loss of consciousness. \n \n\nSevere symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nFor patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) \n\ninhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form uncommonly (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens \n\nyour medicine may stop working properly and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this \n\nhappens, you should contact your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\nHeadache, nausea, diarrhoea, rash \n\n \n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\nFlushing, allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\nFactor VIII inhibitors (for patients who have received previous treatment with Factor VIII (more than \n\n150 days of treatment)) \n\n \n\nAdditional side effects in children \n\nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \n\nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n\nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.
