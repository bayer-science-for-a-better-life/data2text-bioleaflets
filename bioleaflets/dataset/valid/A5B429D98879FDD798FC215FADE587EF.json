NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTrimbow 87 micrograms/5 micrograms/9 micrograms pressurised inhalation, solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach delivered dose (the dose leaving the mouthpiece) contains 87 micrograms of beclometasone \ndipropionate, 5 micrograms of formoterol fumarate dihydrate and 9 micrograms of glycopyrronium (as \n11 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide). \n \nEach metered dose (the dose leaving the valve) contains 100 micrograms of beclometasone \ndipropionate, 6 micrograms of formoterol fumarate dihydrate and 10 micrograms of glycopyrronium \n(as 12.5 micrograms glycopyrronium bromide). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPressurised inhalation, solution (pressurised inhalation). \n \nColourless to yellowish liquid solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMaintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a \nlong-acting beta2-agonist or a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting \nmuscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see \nsection 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose is two inhalations of Trimbow twice daily. \nThe maximum dose is two inhalations of Trimbow twice daily. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly  \nNo dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients (65 years of age and older). \n \nRenal impairment \nTrimbow can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. \nUse of Trimbow in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, \nespecially if associated with significant body weight reduction, should be considered only if the \nexpected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere are no relevant data on the use of Trimbow in patients with severe hepatic impairment and the \nmedicinal product should be used with caution in these patients (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Trimbow in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the \nindication of COPD. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor inhalation use. \n \nTo ensure proper administration of the medicinal product, the patient should be shown how to use the \ninhaler correctly by a physician or other healthcare professional, who should also regularly check the \nadequacy of the patient\u2019s inhalation technique. The patient should be advised to read the Package \nLeaflet carefully and follow the instructions for use as given in the leaflet. \n \nAfter inhaling, patients should rinse their mouth or gargle with water without swallowing it or brush \ntheir teeth (see section 4.4 and 6.6). \n \nTrimbow is provided with a dose counter or dose indicator on the back of the inhaler, which shows \nhow many actuations are left. For the 60 and 120 actuation pressurised containers each time the patient \npresses the container a puff of the solution is released and the counter counts down by one.  \nFor the 180 actuation pressurised container, each time the patient presses the pressurised container a \npuff of the solution is released and the counter rotates by a small amount; the number of puffs \nremaining is displayed in intervals of 20. \nPatients should be advised not to drop the inhaler as this may cause the counter to count down. \n \nFor instructions for use, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nNot for acute use \n \nTrimbow is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, or to treat an acute \nCOPD exacerbation (i.e. as a rescue therapy). \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after administration of Trimbow. If signs \nsuggesting allergic reactions occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing or \nswallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips and face), urticaria or skin rash, Trimbow should be \ndiscontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm \n \nParadoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath \nafter dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator (reliever). \nTrimbow should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if \nnecessary. \n \nDeterioration of disease \n \nIt is recommended that treatment with Trimbow should not be stopped abruptly. If patients find the \ntreatment ineffective, they should continue treatment but medical attention must be sought. Increasing \nuse of reliever bronchodilators indicates a worsening of the underlying condition and warrants a \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nreassessment of the therapy. Sudden and progressive deterioration in the symptoms of COPD is \npotentially life-threatening and the patient should undergo urgent medical assessment. \n \nCardiovascular effects \n \nTrimbow should be used with caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias, especially third degree \natrioventricular block and tachyarrhythmias (accelerated and/or irregular heart beat), idiopathic \nsubvalvular aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe heart disease \n(particularly acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure), occlusive \nvascular diseases (particularly arteriosclerosis), arterial hypertension and aneurysm. \nCaution should also be exercised when treating patients with known or suspected prolongation of the \nQTc interval (QTc > 450 milliseconds for males, or > 470 milliseconds for females), either congenital \nor induced by medicinal products as these patients were excluded from clinical trials with Trimbow. \n \nIf anaesthesia with halogenated anaesthetics is planned, it should be ensured that Trimbow is not \nadministered for at least 12 hours before the start of anaesthesia as there is a risk of cardiac \narrhythmias. \n \nCaution is also required when Trimbow is used by patients with thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, \npheochromocytoma and untreated hypokalaemia. \n \nPneumonia in patients with COPD \n \nAn increase in the incidence of pneumonia, including pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, has been \nobserved in patients with COPD receiving inhaled corticosteroids. There is some evidence of an \nincreased risk of pneumonia with increasing steroid dose but this has not been demonstrated \nconclusively across all studies. \n \nThere is no conclusive clinical evidence for intra-class differences in the magnitude of the pneumonia \nrisk among inhaled corticosteroid products. \n \nPhysicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD \nas the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. \n \nRisk factors for pneumonia in patients with COPD include current smoking, older age, low body mass \nindex (BMI) and severe COPD. \n \nSystemic corticosteroid effects \n \nSystemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for \nlong periods. The daily dose of Trimbow corresponds to a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid; \nfurthermore, these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible \nsystemic effects include: Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth \nretardation, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, glaucoma and, more rarely, a range of \npsychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, \ndepression or aggression (particularly in children). Therefore, it is important that the patient is \nreviewed regularly. \n \nTrimbow should be administered with caution in patients with active or quiescent pulmonary \ntuberculosis, fungal and viral infections in the airways. \n \nHypokalaemia \n \nPotentially serious hypokalaemia may result from beta2-agonist therapy. This has the potential to \nproduce adverse cardiovascular effects. Particular caution is advised in severe COPD as this effect \nmay be potentiated by hypoxia. Hypokalaemia may also be potentiated by concomitant treatment with \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\nother medicinal products which can induce hypokalaemia, such as xanthine derivatives, steroids and \ndiuretics (see section 4.5). \nCaution is also recommended when a number of reliever bronchodilators are used. It is recommended \nthat serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations. \n \nHyperglycaemia \n \nThe inhalation of formoterol may cause a rise in blood glucose levels. Therefore, blood glucose should \nbe monitored during treatment following established guidelines in patients with diabetes. \n \nAnticholinergic effect \n \nGlycopyrronium should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic \nhyperplasia or urinary retention. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of acute \nnarrow-angle glaucoma and should be informed to stop using Trimbow and to contact their doctor \nimmediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. \nAdditionally, due to the anticholinergic effect of glycopyrronium, the long-term co-administration of \nTrimbow with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products is not recommended (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nPatients with severe renal impairment \n \nIn patients with severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease requiring \ndialysis, especially if associated with a significant body weight reduction, Trimbow should be used \nonly if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). These patients should be \nmonitored for potential adverse reactions. \n \nPatients with severe hepatic impairment \n \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, Trimbow should be used only if the expected benefit \noutweighs the potential risk (see section 5.2). These patients should be monitored for potential adverse \nreactions. \n \nUse with a spacer \n \nSingle dose pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2) have demonstrated that in comparison to routine \nuse without a spacer device, the use of Trimbow with the AeroChamber Plus spacer device increased \nthe total systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to glycopyrronium. However, available safety data from long-\nterm clinical studies have not raised any significant safety concerns (see section 5.1). \n \nPrevention of oropharyngeal infections \n \nIn order to reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candida infection, patients should be advised to rinse their \nmouth or gargle with water without swallowing it or brush their teeth after inhaling the prescribed \ndose. \n \nVisual disturbance \n \nVisual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents \nwith symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for \nreferral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma \nor rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use \nof systemic and topical corticosteroids. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nSince glycopyrronium is eliminated mainly by the renal route, drug interaction could potentially occur \nwith medicinal products affecting renal excretion mechanisms (see section 5.2). The effect of organic \ncation transport inhibition (using cimetidine as a probe inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1 transporters) in \nthe kidneys on inhaled glycopyrronium disposition showed a limited increase in its total systemic \nexposure (AUC0-t) by 16% and a slight decrease in renal clearance by 20% due to co administration of \ncimetidine. \n \nBeclometasone is less dependent on CYP3A metabolism than some other corticosteroids, and in \ngeneral interactions are unlikely; however, the possibility of systemic effects with concomitant use of \nstrong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, cobicistat) cannot be excluded, and therefore caution and \nappropriate monitoring is advised with the use of such medicinal products. \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nRelated to formoterol \nNon-cardioselective beta-blockers (including eye drops) should be avoided in patients taking inhaled \nformoterol. If they are administered for compelling reasons, the effect of formoterol will be reduced or \nabolished.  \n \nConcomitant use of other beta-adrenergic medicinal products can have potentially additive effects; \ntherefore, caution is required when other beta-adrenergic medicinal products are prescribed \nconcomitantly with formoterol. \n \nConcomitant treatment with quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, antihistamines, monoamine \noxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines can prolong the QT interval and \nincrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, L-dopa, L-thyroxine, oxytocin and alcohol \ncan impair cardiac tolerance towards beta2-sympathomimetics. \n \nConcomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, including medicinal products with similar \nproperties such as furazolidone and procarbazine, may precipitate hypertensive reactions. \n \nThere is an elevated risk of arrhythmias in patients receiving concomitant anaesthesia with \nhalogenated hydrocarbons. \n \nConcomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate a possible \nhypokalaemic effect of beta2-agonists (see section 4.4). Hypokalaemia may increase the disposition \ntowards arrhythmias in patients who are treated with digitalis glycosides. \n \nRelated to glycopyrronium \nThe long-term co-administration of Trimbow with other anticholinergic-containing medicinal products \nhas not been studied and is therefore not recommended (see section 4.4). \n \nExcipients \n \nTrimbow contains a small amount of ethanol. There is a theoretical potential for interaction in \nparticularly sensitive patients taking disulfiram or metronidazole. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is no experience with or evidence of safety issues on the use of the propellant norflurane \n(HFA134a) during human pregnancy or lactation. However, studies on the effect of HFA134a on the \nreproductive function and embryofoetal development in animals revealed no clinically relevant \nadverse effects. \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Trimbow in pregnant women. \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Glucocorticoid agents are \nknown to cause effects in the early gestation phase, while beta2-sympathomimetic agents like \nformoterol have tocolytic effects. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the \nuse of Trimbow during pregnancy and during labour. \n \nTrimbow should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient outweighs the \npotential risk to the foetus. Infants and neonates born to mothers receiving substantial doses of \nTrimbow should be observed for adrenal suppression. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nThere are no relevant clinical data on the use of Trimbow during breast-feeding in humans.  \n \nGlucocorticoids are excreted in human milk. It is reasonable to assume that beclometasone \ndipropionate and its metabolites are also excreted into breast-milk. \nIt is unknown whether formoterol or glycopyrronium (including their metabolites) pass into human \nbreast-milk but they have been detected in the milk of lactating animals. Anticholinergic agents like \nglycopyrronium could suppress lactation. \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nTrimbow therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the mothers. \n \nFertility \n \nNo specific studies have been performed with Trimbow with regard to the safety in human fertility. \nAnimal studies have shown impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTrimbow has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Trimbow were oral candidiasis (which occurred \nin 0.8% of the exposed subjects), which is normally associated with inhaled corticosteroids; muscle \nspasms (0.4%), which can be attributed to the long-acting beta2-agonist component; dry mouth \n(0.4%), which is a typical anticholinergic effect. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe clinical development programme of Trimbow was conducted in patients with moderate, severe or \nvery severe COPD. A total of 3,346 patients were treated with beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol \nfumarate dihydrate/glycopyrronium 87 micrograms/5 micrograms/9 micrograms at the target dose \nregimen (two inhalations twice daily) in multiple dose studies. \nThe frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); \ncommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nMedDRA system organ \nclass Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nInfections and Infestations \n\nPneumonia (in COPD patients), pharyngitis, oral \ncandidiasis, urinary tract infection1, nasopharyngitis1 Common \n\nInfluenza1, oral fungal infection, oropharyngeal \ncandidiasis, oesophageal candidiasis1, sinusitis1, \nrhinitis1, gastroenteritis1, vulvovaginal candidiasis1 \n\nUncommon \n\nLower respiratory tract infection (fungal) Rare \nBlood and lymphatic \nsystem disorders \n\nGranulocytopenia1 Uncommon \nThrombocytopenia1 Very rare \n\nImmune system disorders \nDermatitis allergic1 Uncommon \nHypersensitivity reactions, including erythema, lips, \nface, eye and pharyngeal oedema Rare \n\nEndocrine disorders Adrenal suppression1 Very rare \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders \n\nHypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia Uncommon \nDecreased appetite Rare \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n\nRestlessness1 Uncommon \nPsychomotor hyperactivity1, sleep disorders1, anxiety, \ndepression1, aggression1, behavioural changes \n(predominantly in children) 1 \n\nFrequency not \nknown \n\nInsomnia Rare \n\nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Common \nTremor, dizziness, dysgeusia1, hypoaesthesia1 Uncommon \nHypersomnia Rare \n\nEye disorders Vision, blurred\n1 (see also section 4.4) Frequency not known \n\nGlaucoma1, cataract1 Very rare \nEar and labyrinth disorders Otosalpingitis1 Uncommon \n\nCardiac disorders \n\nAtrial fibrillation, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, \ntachycardia, tachyarrhythmia1, palpitations Uncommon \n\nAngina pectoris (stable1 and unstable), ventricular \nextrasystoles1, nodal rhythm, sinus bradycardia Rare \n\nVascular disorders Hyperaemia\n1, flushing1, hypertension Uncommon \n\nExtravasation blood  Rare \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nDysphonia Common \nCough, productive cough1, throat irritation, epistaxis1 Uncommon \nBronchospasm paradoxical1, oropharyngeal pain, \npharyngeal erythema, pharyngeal inflammation, dry \nthroat \n\nRare \n\nDyspnoea1 Very rare \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhoea1, dry mouth, dysphagia1, nausea, dyspepsia1, \nburning sensation of the lips1, dental caries1, \n(aphthous) stomatitis \n\nUncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nRash1, urticaria1, pruritus, hyperhidrosis1 Uncommon \nAngioedema1 Rare \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue disorders \n\nMuscle spasms, myalgia, pain in extremity1, \nmusculoskeletal chest pain1 Uncommon \n\nGrowth retardation1 Very rare \nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n  \nDysuria, urinary retention, nephritis1 Rare \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\nFatigue1  Uncommon \nAsthenia Rare \nOedema peripheral1 Very rare \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nMedDRA system organ \nclass Adverse reaction Frequency \n\nInvestigations \n\nC-reactive protein increased1, platelet count \nincreased1, free fatty acids increased1, blood insulin \nincreased1, blood ketone body increased1, cortisol \ndecreased1 \n\nUncommon \n\nBlood pressure increased1, blood pressure decreased1 Rare \nBone density decreased1 Very rare \n\n1 Adverse reactions reported in the SmPC of at least one of the individual components, but not observed as adverse reactions \nin the clinical development of Trimbow  \n \nAmong the observed adverse reactions the following are typically associated with: \n \nBeclometasone dipropionate: pneumonia, oral fungal infections, lower respiratory tract infection \nfungal, dysphonia, throat irritation, hyperglycaemia, psychiatric disorders, cortisol decreased, blurred \nvision. \n \nFormoterol: hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, tremor, palpitations, muscle spasms, electrocardiogram \nQT prolonged, blood pressure increased, blood pressure decreased, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, \ntachyarrhythmia, angina pectoris (stable and unstable), ventricular extrasystoles, nodal rhythm. \n \nGlycopyrronium: glaucoma, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, dental caries, \ndysuria, urinary retention, urinary tract infection.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nAn overdose of Trimbow may produce signs and symptoms due to the individual component\u2019s actions, \nincluding those seen with overdose of other beta2-agonists or anticholinergics and consistent with the \nknown inhaled corticosteroid class effects (see section 4.4). If overdose occurs, the patient\u2019s symptoms \nshould be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with \nanticholinergics incl. triple combinations with corticosteroids. ATC code: R03AL09. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n \nTrimbow contains beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol and glycopyrronium in a solution \nformulation resulting in an aerosol with extrafine particles with an average mass median aerodynamic \ndiameter (MMAD) of around 1.1 micrometres and co-deposition of the three components. The aerosol \nparticles of Trimbow are on average much smaller than the particles delivered in non-extrafine \nformulations. For beclometasone dipropionate, this results in a more potent effect than formulations \nwith a non-extrafine particle size distribution (100 micrograms of beclometasone dipropionate \nextrafine in Trimbow are equivalent to 250 micrograms of beclometasone dipropionate in a \nnon-extrafine formulation). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nBeclometasone dipropionate \nBeclometasone dipropionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a glucocorticoid anti-\ninflammatory action within the lungs. Glucocorticoids are widely used for the suppression of \ninflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases of the airways such as COPD. Their action is mediated \nby the binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm resulting in the increased transcription of \ngenes coding for antiinflammatory proteins. \n \nFormoterol \nFormoterol is a selective beta2-adrenergic agonist that produces relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle \nin patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect sets in rapidly, within \n1-3 minutes after inhalation, and has a duration of 12 hours after a single dose. \n \nGlycopyrronium \nGlycopyrronium is a high-affinity, long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) used \nfor inhalation as bronchodilator treatment of COPD. Glycopyrronium works by blocking the \nbronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the \nairways. Glycopyrronium bromide is a high affinity muscarinic receptor antagonist with a greater than \n4-fold selectivity for the human M3 receptors over the human M2 receptor as it has been \ndemonstrated. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe Phase III clinical development programme in COPD included two 52-week active-controlled \nstudies. Study TRILOGY compared Trimbow with a fixed combination of beclometasone \ndipropionate and formoterol 100/6 micrograms two inhalations twice daily (1,368 randomised \npatients). Study TRINITY compared Trimbow with tiotropium 18 micrograms inhalation powder, \nhard capsule, one inhalation once daily; in addition, effects were compared with an extemporary triple \ncombination made of a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol \n100/6 micrograms two inhalations twice daily plus tiotropium 18 micrograms inhalation powder, hard \ncapsule, one inhalation once daily (2,691 randomised patients). Both studies were conducted in \npatients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD with severe to very severe airflow limitation (FEV1 less \nthan 50% predicted), with symptoms assessed as a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score of 10 or \nabove, and with at least one COPD exacerbation in the previous year. The two studies included \napproximately 20% of patients who used the AeroChamber Plus spacer. \nIn addition, two Phase IIIb studies were conducted to support the clinical efficacy and safety of \nTrimbow. TRISTAR was a 26-week active-controlled open label study comparing Trimbow with an \nextemporary combination made of a fixed combination of fluticasone/vilanterol 92/22 micrograms \ninhalation powder, one inhalation once daily plus tiotropium 18 micrograms inhalation powder, hard \ncapsule, one inhalation once daily (1,157 randomised patients). TRIBUTE was a 52-week active-\ncontrolled study comparing Trimbow with a fixed combination of indacaterol/glycopyrronium 85/43 \nmicrograms inhalation powder, hard capsule, one inhalation once daily (1,532 randomised patients). \nBoth studies were conducted in a similar population of COPD patients as studies TRILOGY and \nTRINITY.  \n \nReduction of COPD exacerbations \nCompared with a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol, Trimbow reduced \nthe rate of moderate/severe exacerbations over 52 weeks by 23% (rate: 0.41 versus 0.53 events per \npatient/year; p = 0.005). Compared with tiotropium, Trimbow reduced the rate of moderate/severe \nexacerbations over 52 weeks by 20% (rate: 0.46 versus 0.57 events per patient/year; p = 0.003). \nCompared with a fixed combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium, Trimbow reduced the rate of \nmoderate/severe exacerbations over 52 weeks by 15% (rate: 0.50 versus 0.59 events per patient/year; \np = 0.043). Compared with tiotropium, Trimbow also reduced the rate of severe exacerbations (i.e. \nexcluding moderate exacerbations) by 32% (rate: 0.067 versus 0.098 events per patient/year; \np = 0.017). No differences were observed when comparing Trimbow with the extemporary triple \ncombination made of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fixed combination plus tiotropium \n(moderate/severe exacerbation rate: 0.46 versus 0.45 events per patient/year). \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\nIn addition, compared with both a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol \nand with tiotropium, Trimbow significantly prolonged the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.80 \nand 0.84 respectively; p = 0.020 and 0.015 respectively), with no differences between Trimbow and \nthe extemporary triple combination made of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fixed \ncombination plus tiotropium (hazard ratio 1.06). \n \nEffects on lung function \n \nPre-dose FEV1 \nCompared with a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol, Trimbow \nimproved pre-dose FEV1 by 81 mL after 26 weeks of treatment and by 63 mL after 52 weeks of \ntreatment. Compared with tiotropium, Trimbow improved pre-dose FEV1 by 51 mL after 26 weeks of \ntreatment and by 61 mL after 52 weeks of treatment. These improvements were statistically significant \n(p < 0.001). Compared with a fixed combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium, Trimbow \nimproved average pre-dose FEV1 over the 52-week treatment period by 22 mL (p=0.018). Similar \nimprovements, although not statistically significant, were observed at weeks 26 and 52.  \nNo differences were observed when comparing Trimbow and the extemporary triple combination \nmade of a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol plus tiotropium \n(difference of 3 mL in pre-dose FEV1 after 52 weeks of treatment). \n \n2-hour post-dose FEV1 \nCompared with a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol, Trimbow \nsignificantly improved 2-hour post dose FEV1 by 117 mL after 26 weeks of treatment and by 103 mL \nafter 52 weeks of treatment (p < 0.001). This endpoint was only measured in study TRILOGY. \n \nInspiratory Capacity (IC) \nCompared with tiotropium, Trimbow significantly improved IC by 39 mL (p = 0.025) and 60 mL \n(p = 0.001) after 26 and 52 weeks of treatment respectively. Similar effects were seen when comparing \nTrimbow with the extemporary triple combination. This endpoint was only measured in study \nTRINITY. \n \nSymptomatic outcomes \nTrimbow significantly improved dyspnoea (measured as the Transition Dyspnoea Index \u2013 TDI - focal \nscore) after 26 weeks of treatment compared with baseline (by 1.71 units; p < 0.001), but the adjusted \nmean difference versus a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol was not \nstatistically significant (0.21 units; p = 0.160). A responder analysis showed that a significantly greater \npercentage of patients had a clinically significant improvement (focal score greater than or equal to 1) \nafter 26 weeks with Trimbow than with a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and \nformoterol (57.4% versus 51.8%; p = 0.027). TDI was only measured in study TRILOGY. \nTrimbow was also statistically significantly superior to a fixed combination of beclometasone \ndipropionate and formoterol, to tiotropium and to a fixed combination of indacaterol and \nglycopyrronium in terms of improvement in quality of life (measured by the Saint George Respiratory \nQuestionnaire \u2013 SGRQ - total score). No differences were observed when comparing Trimbow and the \nextemporary triple combination made of fluticasone and vilanterol fixed combination plus tiotropium.  \nA responder analysis showed that a significantly greater percentage of patients had a clinically \nsignificant improvement (reduction versus baseline of greater than or equal to 4) after 26 and 52 weeks \nwith Trimbow than with a fixed combination of beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol and with \ntiotropium. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nTrimbow in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information on \npaediatric use). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nRelated to Trimbow \n \nThe systemic exposure to beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol and glycopyrronium has been \ninvestigated in a pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy subjects. The study compared data \nobtained after treatment with a single dose of Trimbow (4 inhalations of 100/6/25 micrograms, a \nnon-marketed formulation containing twice the approved strength of glycopyrronium) or a single dose \nof the extemporary combination of beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol (4 inhalations of \n100/6 micrograms) plus glycopyrronium (4 inhalations of 25 micrograms). The maximum plasma \nconcentration and systemic exposure of beclometasone dipropionate main active metabolite \n(beclometasone 17-monopropionate) and formoterol were similar after administration of the fixed or \nextemporary combination. For glycopyrronium, the maximum plasma concentration was similar after \nadministration of the fixed or extemporary combination, while the systemic exposure was slightly \nhigher after administration of Trimbow than with the extemporary combination. This study also \ninvestigated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between the active components of Trimbow by \ncomparing the pharmacokinetic data obtained after a single dose of the extemporary combination or \nafter a single dose of the single components beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol or \nglycopyrronium. There was no clear evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction, however the \nextemporary combination showed formoterol and glycopyrronium levels transiently slightly higher \nimmediately after dosing compared with the single components. It is noted that single component \nglycopyrronium, formulated as pressurised metered dose inhaler, which was used in the PK studies, is \nnot available on the market.  \n \nA comparison across studies showed that the pharmacokinetics of beclometasone 17-monopropionate, \nformoterol and glycopyrronium is similar in COPD patients and in healthy subjects. \n \nEffect of a spacer \nThe use of Trimbow with the AeroChamber Plus spacer in COPD patients increased the lung delivery \nof beclometasone 17-monopropionate, formoterol and glycopyrronium (maximum plasma \nconcentration increased by 15%, 58% and 60% respectively). The total systemic exposure (as \nmeasured by AUC0-t) was slightly reduced for beclometasone 17-monopropionate (by 37%) and \nformoterol (by 24%), while it was increased for glycopyrronium (by 45%). See also section 4.4. \n \nEffect of renal impairment \nSystemic exposure (AUC0-t) to beclometasone dipropionate, to its metabolite beclometasone \n17-monopropionate and to formoterol was not affected by mild to severe renal impairment. For \nglycopyrronium, there was no impact in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment. However, \nan increase in total systemic exposure of up to 2.5-fold was observed in subjects with severe renal \nimpairment (glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), as a consequence of a significant \nreduction of the amount excreted in urine (approximately 90% reduction of glycopyrronium renal \nclearance). Simulations performed with a pharmacokinetic model showed that even when covariates \nhad extreme values (body weight less than 40 kg and concomitant glomerular filtration rate below \n27 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2), exposure to Trimbow active substances remains in approximately a 2.5-fold \nrange compared to the exposure in a typical patient with median covariate values. \n \nRelated to beclometasone dipropionate \n \nBeclometasone dipropionate is a pro-drug with weak glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity that is \nhydrolysed via esterase enzymes to an active metabolite beclometasone 17-monopropionate which has \na more potent topical anti-inflammatory activity compared with the pro-drug beclometasone \ndipropionate. \n \nAbsorption, distribution and biotransformation \nInhaled beclometasone dipropionate is rapidly absorbed through the lungs; prior to absorption there is \nextensive conversion to beclometasone 17-monopropionate via esterase enzymes that are found in \nmost tissues. The systemic availability of the active metabolite arises from lung (36%) and from \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\ngastrointestinal absorption of the swallowed dose. The bioavailability of swallowed beclometasone \ndipropionate is negligible; however, pre-systemic conversion to beclometasone 17-monopropionate \nresults in 41% of the dose being absorbed as the active metabolite. There is an approximately linear \nincrease in systemic exposure with increasing inhaled dose. The absolute bioavailability following \ninhalation is approximately 2% and 62% of the nominal dose for unchanged beclometasone \ndipropionate and beclometasone 17-monopropionate respectively. Following intravenous dosing, the \ndisposition of beclometasone dipropionate and its active metabolite is characterised by high plasma \nclearance (150 and 120 L/h respectively), with a small volume of distribution at steady state for \nbeclometasone dipropionate (20 L) and larger tissue distribution for its active metabolite (424 L). \nPlasma protein binding is moderately high. \n \nElimination \nFaecal excretion is the major route of beclometasone dipropionate elimination mainly as polar \nmetabolites. The renal excretion of beclometasone dipropionate and its metabolites is negligible. The \nterminal elimination half-lives are 0.5 hours and 2.7 hours for beclometasone dipropionate and \nbeclometasone 17-monopropionate respectively. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of beclometasone dipropionate in patients with hepatic impairment has not been \nstudied, however, as beclometasone dipropionate undergoes a very rapid metabolism via esterase \nenzymes present in intestinal fluid, serum, lungs and liver to form the more polar products \nbeclometasone 21-monopropionate, beclometasone 17-monopropionate and beclometasone, hepatic \nimpairment is not expected to modify the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of beclometasone \ndipropionate. \n \nRelated to formoterol \n \nAbsorption and distribution \nFollowing inhalation, formoterol is absorbed from both the lung and the gastrointestinal tract. The \nfraction of an inhaled dose that is swallowed after administration with a metered dose inhaler may \nrange between 60% and 90%. At least 65% of the fraction that is swallowed is absorbed from the \ngastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentrations of the unchanged active substance occur within 0.5 \nto 1 hours after oral administration. Plasma protein binding of formoterol is 61-64% with 34% bound \nto albumin. There was no saturation of binding in the concentration range attained with therapeutic \ndoses. The elimination half-life determined after oral administration is 2-3 hours. Absorption of \nformoterol is linear following inhalation of 12 to 96 micrograms of formoterol. \n \nBiotransformation \nFormoterol is widely metabolised and the prominent pathway involves direct conjugation at the \nphenolic hydroxyl group. Glucuronide acid conjugate is inactive. The second major pathway involves \nO-demethylation followed by conjugation at the phenolic 2'-hydroxyl group. Cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 are involved in the O-demethylation of formoterol. \nLiver appears to be the primary site of metabolism. Formoterol does not inhibit CYP450 enzymes at \ntherapeutically relevant concentrations. \n \nElimination \nThe cumulative urinary excretion of formoterol after single inhalation from a dry powder inhaler \nincreased linearly in the 12-96 micrograms dose range. On average, 8% and 25% of the dose was \nexcreted as unchanged and total formoterol, respectively. Based on plasma concentrations measured \nfollowing inhalation of a single 120 micrograms dose by 12 healthy subjects, the mean terminal \nelimination half-life was determined to be 10 hours. The (R,R)- and (S,S)-enantiomers represented \nabout 40% and 60% of unchanged active substance excreted in the urine, respectively. The relative \nproportion of the two enantiomers remained constant over the dose range studied and there was no \nevidence of relative accumulation of one enantiomer over the other after repeated dosing. After oral \nadministration (40 to 80 micrograms), 6% to 10% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged \nactive substance in healthy subjects; up to 8% of the dose was recovered as the glucuronide. A total \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n67% of an oral dose of formoterol is excreted in urine (mainly as metabolites) and the remainder in the \nfaeces. The renal clearance of formoterol is 150 mL/min. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of formoterol has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment; \nhowever, as formoterol is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an increased exposure can be \nexpected in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nRelated to glycopyrronium  \n \nAbsorption and distribution \nGlycopyrronium has a quaternary ammonium structure which limits its passage across biological \nmembranes and produces slow, variable and incomplete gastrointestinal absorption. Following \nglycopyrronium inhalation, the lung bioavailability was 10.5% (with activated charcoal ingestion) \nwhile the absolute bioavailability was 12.8% (without activated charcoal ingestion) confirming the \nlimited gastrointestinal absorption and indicating that more than 80% of glycopyrronium systemic \nexposure was from lung absorption. After repeated inhalation of twice daily doses ranging from 12.5 \nto 50 micrograms via pressurised metered dose inhaler in COPD patients, glycopyrronium showed \nlinear pharmacokinetics with little systemic accumulation at steady state (median accumulation ratio \n2.2-2.5).  \nThe apparent volume of distribution (Vz) of inhaled glycopyrronium was increased compared to \nintravenous (i.v.) infusion (6420 L versus 323 L), reflecting the slower elimination after inhalation.  \n \nBiotransformation \nThe metabolic pattern of glycopyrronium in vitro (humans, dogs, rats, mice and rabbits liver \nmicrosomes and hepatocytes) was similar among species and the main metabolic reaction was the \nhydroxylation on the phenyl or ciclopentyl rings. CYP2D6 was found to be the only enzyme \nresponsible for glycopyrronium metabolism. \n \nElimination \nThe mean elimination half-life of glycopyrronium in healthy volunteers was approximately 6 hours \nafter i.v. injection while after inhalation in COPD patients it ranged from 5 to 12 hours at steady state. \nAfter a glycopyrronium single i.v. injection, 40% of the dose was excreted in the urine within \n24 hours. In COPD patients receiving repeated twice daily administration of inhaled glycopyrronium, \nthe fraction of the dose excreted in urine ranged from 13.0% to 14.5% at steady state. Mean renal \nclearance was similar across the range of doses tested and after single and repeated inhalation (range \n281-396 mL/min). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeat dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. \n \nSafety pharmacology  \nIn an inhalation study in telemetered dogs, the cardiovascular system was a major target system for \nacute effects of Trimbow (increase in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, ECG changes at higher \ndoses), effects probably mainly related to the beta2-adrenergic activity of formoterol and the \nanti-muscarinic activity of glycopyrronium. There was no evidence for overadditive effects of the \ntriple combination when compared with the single components. \n \nRepeat dose toxicity \nIn repeat dose inhalation studies with Trimbow in rats and dogs of up to 13 weeks duration, the main \nobserved alterations were related to effects on the immune system (probably due to systemic \ncorticosteroid effects of beclometasone dipropionate and its active metabolite beclometasone-\n17-monopropionate) and on the cardiovascular system (probably related to the beta2-adrenergic \nactivity of formoterol and the anti-muscarinic activity of glycopyrronium). The toxicological profile of \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nthe triple combination reflected that of the single active components without a relevant increase in \ntoxicity and without unexpected findings. \n \nReproductive and development toxicity \nBeclometasone dipropionate/beclometasone-17-monopropionate was considered responsible for \nreproductive toxicity effects in rats such as reduction of the conception rate, fertility index, early \nembryonic development parameters (implantation loss), delay in ossification and increased incidence \nof visceral variations; while tocolytic and anti-muscarinic effects, attributed to the beta2-adrenergic \nactivity of formoterol and the anti-muscarinic activity of glycopyrronium, affected pregnant rats in the \nlate phase of gestation and/or early phase of lactation, leading to loss of pups. \n \nGenotoxicity \nGenotoxicity of Trimbow has not been evaluated, however, the single active components were devoid \nof genotoxic activity in the conventional test systems. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with Trimbow. However, in a 104-week rat \ninhalation carcinogenicity study and an oral 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic Tg.rasH2 \nmice, glycopyrronium bromide showed no carcinogenic potential and published data concerning long-\nterm studies conducted with beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate in rats do not \nindicate a clinically relevant carcinogenic potential. \n \n \n6.

The pressurised container is inserted \nin a polypropylene inhaler which incorporates a mouthpiece and a dose counter (60 actuations or \n120 actuations per pressurised container) or dose indicator (180 actuations per pressurised container) \nand is provided with a polypropylene mouthpiece cap. \n \nPack sizes of 1 container of 60, 120 or 180 actuations and multipacks of 2 or 3 containers of \n120 actuations each. \n \nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \nFor pharmacists: \n \nEnter the date of dispensing to the patient on the pack. \n \n \nInstructions for use \n \nPriming the inhaler \nBefore using the inhaler for the first time, the patient should release one actuation into the air in order \nto ensure that the inhaler is working properly (priming). Before priming the 60, 120 or 180 actuation \npressurised containers, the counter/indicator should read 61, 121 or 180, respectively. After priming, \nthe counter/indicator should read 60, 120 or 180.  \n \nUse of the inhaler \nPatients should stand or sit in an upright position when inhaling from their inhaler. The steps below \nshould be followed. IMPORTANT: steps 2 to 5 should not be performed too quickly: \n1. Patients should remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece and check that the mouthpiece is \n\nclean and free from dust and dirt or any other foreign objects. \n2. Patients should breathe out slowly and as deeply as comfortable, in order to empty their lungs. \n3. Patients should hold the inhaler vertically with its body upwards and place the mouthpiece \n\nbetween their teeth without biting. Their lips should then be placed around the mouthpiece, with \nthe tongue flat under it.  \n\n4. At the same time, patients should breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouth until the \nlungs are full of air (this should take approximately 4 \u2013 5 seconds). Immediately after starting to \nbreathe in, patients should firmly press down on the top of the pressurised container to release \none puff. \n\n5. Patients should then hold their breath for as long as comfortably possible, then remove the \ninhaler from the mouth and breathe out slowly. Patients should not breathe out into the inhaler. \n\n6. Patients should then check the dose counter or dose indicator to ensure it has moved \naccordingly. \n\n \nTo inhale the second puff, patients should keep the inhaler in a vertical position for approximately \n30 seconds and repeat steps 2 to 6. \n \nIf mist appears after the inhalation, either from the inhaler or from the sides of the mouth, the \nprocedure should be repeated from step 2. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nAfter use, patients should close the inhaler with the protective mouthpiece cover and check the dose \ncounter or dose indicator. \n \nAfter inhaling, patients should rinse their mouth or gargle with water without swallowing it or brush \ntheir teeth (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nWhen to get a new inhaler \nPatients should be advised to get a new inhaler when the dose counter or indicator shows the number \n20. They should stop using the inhaler when the counter or indicator shows 0 as any puffs left in the \ndevice may not be enough to release a full actuation. \n \nAdditional instructions for specific groups of patients \nFor patients with weak hands it may be easier to hold the inhaler with both hands. Therefore, the index \nfingers should be placed on the top of the pressurised container and both thumbs on the base of the \ninhaler.  \n \nPatients who find it difficult to synchronise aerosol actuation with inspiration of breath may use the \nAeroChamber Plus spacer device, properly cleaned as described in the relevant leaflet. They should be \nadvised by their doctor or pharmacist about the proper use and care of their inhaler and spacer and \ntheir technique checked to ensure optimum delivery of the inhaled active substance to the lungs. This \nmay be obtained by the patients using the AeroChamber Plus by one continuous slow and deep breath \nthrough the spacer, without any delay between actuation and inhalation. Alternatively, patients may \nsimply breathe in and out (through the mouth) after the actuation, as instructed in the spacer leaflet, to \nobtain the active substance. See section 4.4 and section 5.2. \n \nCleaning \nFor the regular cleaning of the inhaler, patients should remove weekly the cap from the mouthpiece \nand wipe the outside and inside of the mouthpiece with a dry cloth. They should not remove the \npressurised container from the actuator and should not use water or other liquids to clean the \nmouthpiece. \n \n \n7.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Trimbow is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Trimbow \n3. How to use Trimbow \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Trimbow \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Trimbow is and what it is used for \n \nTrimbow is a medicine to help breathing that contains the three active substances: \n\u2022 beclometasone dipropionate,  \n\u2022 formoterol fumarate dihydrate and  \n\u2022 glycopyrronium.  \n \nBeclometasone dipropionate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids which act to \nreduce the swelling and irritation in your lungs. \n \nFormoterol and glycopyrronium are medicines called long-acting bronchodilators. They act in \ndifferent ways to relax the muscles in your airways, helping to open the airways wider and allowing \nyou to breathe more easily. \n \nRegular treatment with these three active substances helps to relieve and prevent symptoms such as \nshortness of breath, wheezing and cough in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD). Trimbow can reduce exacerbations (flare-ups) of COPD symptoms. COPD is a serious long-\nterm disease in which the airways become blocked and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged, \nleading to difficulty breathing. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Trimbow \n \nDo not use Trimbow: \n \nIf you are allergic to beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium \nor to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions: \n \nTrimbow is used as a maintenance treatment for your COPD. Do not use this medicine to treat a \nsudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nIf your breathing gets worse: \n \nIf you develop worsening shortness of breath or wheezing (breathing with a whistling sound), straight \nafter inhaling your medicine, stop using Trimbow inhaler and use your quick-acting \u201creliever\u201d inhaler \nstraightaway. You should contact your doctor straightaway. Your doctor will assess your symptoms \nand if necessary may start you on a different treatment.  \nSee also section 4, \u201cPossible side effects\u201d. \n \nIf your COPD gets worse: \n \nIf your symptoms get worse or are difficult to control (e.g. if you are using a separate \u201creliever\u201d \ninhaler more frequently) or if your \u201creliever\u201d inhaler does not improve your symptoms, see your \ndoctor immediately. Your COPD may be getting worse and your doctor may need to prescribe \ndifferent treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Trimbow: \n \n\u2022 if you have any heart problems, such as angina (heart pain, pain in the chest), a recent heart \n\nattack (myocardial infarction), heart failure, narrowing of the arteries around your heart \n(coronary heart disease), disease of your heart valves or any other abnormalities of your heart or \nif you have a condition known as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (also known as \nHOCM, a condition where the heart muscle is abnormal). \n\n \n\u2022 if you have disorders of your heart rhythm such as irregular heart rate, a fast pulse rate or \n\npalpitations or if you have been told that your heart trace (ECG) is abnormal. \n \n\u2022 if you have narrowing of the arteries (also known as arteriosclerosis), if you have high blood \n\npressure or if you have an aneurysm (abnormal bulging of the blood vessel wall). \n \n\u2022 if you have an overactive thyroid gland. \n \n\u2022 if you have low blood levels of potassium (hypokalaemia). The combination of Trimbow with \n\nsome other COPD medicines or medicines such as diuretics (medicines that make the body lose \nwater, to treat heart disease or high blood pressure), can cause a sharp fall in your blood level of \npotassium. Therefore, your doctor may wish to measure the potassium levels in your blood from \ntime to time. \n\n \n\u2022 if you have any disease of your liver or kidneys. \n \n\u2022 if you have diabetes. High doses of formoterol may increase your blood glucose and therefore \n\nyou may need to have extra blood tests to check your blood sugar when you start using this \nmedicine, and from time to time during treatment. \n\n \n\u2022 if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as a phaeochromocytoma). \n \n\u2022 if you are due to have an anaesthetic. Depending on the type of anaesthetic, it may be necessary \n\nto stop using Trimbow at least 12 hours before the anaesthesia. \n \n\u2022 if you are being, or have ever been, treated for tuberculosis (TB) or if you have a chest \n\ninfection. \n \n\u2022 if you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. \n \n\u2022 if you have difficulty passing urine.  \n \n\u2022 if you have an infection of the mouth or throat. \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \nIf any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before you use Trimbow.  \nIf you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies or if you are not sure if you can use \nTrimbow, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using the inhaler.  \n \nIf you are already using Trimbow  \nIf you are using Trimbow or high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids over long periods and you \ncome into a situation of stress (e.g. being taken to hospital after an accident, having a serious injury or \nbefore an operation) you may need more of this medicine. In such a situation, your doctor may need to \nincrease your dose of corticosteroids to cope with the stress and may prescribe them as tablets or \ninjections. \nContact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Trimbow \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines similar to Trimbow used for your lung disease.  \n \nSome medicines may increase the effects of Trimbow and your doctor may wish to monitor you \ncarefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). \n \nDo not use this medicine with a beta-blocker medicine (used for treating certain heart problems \nsuch as angina or for reducing blood pressure) unless your doctor has chosen a beta-blocker that does \nnot affect your breathing. Beta-blockers (including beta-blocker eye-drops) may reduce the effects of \nformoterol or make it not work at all. On the other hand, using other beta2-agonist medicines (which \nwork in the same way as formoterol) may increase the effects of formoterol. \n \nUsing Trimbow together with:  \n \n\u2022 medicines for treating  \n\n- abnormal heart rhythms (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide),  \n- allergic reactions (antihistamines),  \n- symptoms of depression or mental disorders such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (for \n\nexample phenelzine and isocarboxazid), tricyclic antidepressants (for example amitriptyline \nand imipramine), phenothiazines  \n\ncan cause some changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG, heart trace). They may also increase \nthe risk of disturbances of heart rhythm (ventricular arrhythmias). \n\n \n\u2022 medicines for treating Parkinson\u2019s disease (levodopa), to treat an underactive thyroid gland \n\n(levothyroxine), medicines containing oxytocin (which causes uterine contraction) and alcohol \ncan increase the chances of formoterol side effects on the heart. \n\n \n\u2022 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including medicines with similar properties like \n\nfurazolidone and procarbazine, used to treat mental disorders, can cause a rise in blood pressure. \n \n\u2022 medicines for treating heart disease (digoxin) can cause a fall in your blood potassium level. \n\nThis may increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms. \n \n\u2022 other medicines used to treat COPD (theophylline, aminophylline or corticosteroids) and \n\ndiuretics may also cause a fall in your potassium level.  \n \n\u2022 some anaesthetics can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n\u2022 Disulfiram, a medicine used in the treatment of people with alcoholism (drinking problems) or \nmetronidazole, an antibiotic to treat infection in your body can cause side effects (e.g. feeling \nsick, being sick, stomach pain) due to the small amount of alcohol in Trimbow. \n\n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine.  \n \nYou should only use Trimbow during pregnancy if you are advised to do so by your doctor. It is \npreferable to avoid the use of Trimbow during labour due to the inhibitory effects of formoterol on \nuterine contractions. \nYou should not use Trimbow during breast-feeding. You and your doctor must make a decision \nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Trimbow therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for your child and the benefit of therapy for you. \n \nDriving and using machines \nTrimbow is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. \n \n \n3. How to use Trimbow \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nAdults \nThe recommended dose is two puffs in the morning and two puffs in the evening.  \n \nIf you feel that the medicine is not very effective, talk to your doctor. \nIf you have been using a different inhaler containing beclometasone dipropionate previously, ask your \ndoctor for advice, as the effective dose of beclometasone dipropionate in Trimbow for the treatment of \nCOPD may be lower than that of some other inhalers.  \n \nRoute of administration \nTrimbow is for inhalation use. \nYou should inhale the medicine through your mouth and this takes the medicine directly into your \nlungs. \n \nThis medicine is contained in a pressurised container in a plastic inhaler with a mouthpiece.  \n \nTrimbow is available in three container sizes:  \n\u2022 a container providing 60 puffs \n\u2022 a container providing 120 puffs \n\u2022 a container providing 180 puffs. \n \nIf you have been prescribed a container providing 60 puffs or 120 puffs \nThere is a counter on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. Each time you \npress the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the counter will count down by one. \nTake care not to drop the inhaler as this may cause the counter to count down. \n \nIf you have been prescribed a container providing 180 puffs \nThere is an indicator on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. Each time \nyou press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the dose indicator rotates by a \nsmall amount. The number of puffs remaining is displayed in intervals of 20. Take care not to drop the \ninhaler as this may cause the dose indicator to count down. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nTesting your inhaler \nBefore using the inhaler for the first time, you should test your inhaler to make sure that it is working \nproperly, as follows.  \n1. Depending on the container size prescribed to you, check that the dose counter reads 61 or 121 \n\nand that the dose indicator reads 180 \n2. Remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece \n3. Hold your inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom  \n4. Direct the mouthpiece away from yourself and firmly press the pressurised container to release \n\none puff \n5. Check the dose counter or dose indicator. If you are testing your inhaler for the first time, the \n\ncounter should read:  \n \n\n60 \n- when using the container \n\nproviding 60 puffs \n\n120 \n- when using the container \n\nproviding 120 puffs \n\n180 \n- when using the container \n\nproviding 180 puffs \n\n   \n \nHow to use your inhaler \nStand or sit up when inhaling.  \nIMPORTANT: Do not perform steps 2 to 5 too quickly.  \n\n \n1. Remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece and check that the mouthpiece is clean and free \n\nfrom dust and dirt. \n2. Breathe out as slowly and deeply as possible, in order to empty your lungs. \n3. Hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom and place the mouthpiece between \n\nyour teeth without biting it. Then place your lips around the mouthpiece, with the tongue flat \nunder it. \n\n4. Breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth to fill your lungs with air (this should take \nabout 4\u20135 seconds). Just after starting to breathe in, press down firmly on the top of the \npressurised container to release one puff.  \n\n5. Hold your breath for as long as possible and, finally, remove the inhaler from your mouth and \nbreathe out slowly. Do not breathe out into the inhaler. \n\n6. Check that the dose counter (60/120 puffs) has moved down by one or that the dose indicator \n(180 puffs) has rotated by a small amount. \n\n \nFor the second puff, keep the inhaler in the upright position for about half a minute, then repeat steps 2 \nto 5. \n \nIf you see 'mist' coming from the top of the inhaler or the sides of your mouth, this means that \nTrimbow will not be getting into your lungs as it should. Take another puff, following the instructions \nstarting again from step 2. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\nAfter use, replace the protective cap. \n \nTo prevent a fungal infection in the mouth and throat, rinse your mouth or gargle with water without \nswallowing it or brush your teeth after each use of your inhaler. \n \nWhen to get a new inhaler \nYou should get a replacement when the counter or indicator shows the number 20. Stop using the \ninhaler when the counter or indicator shows 0, as any medicine left in the inhaler may not be enough \nto give you a full puff. \n \nIf you have a weak grip, it may be easier to hold the inhaler with both hands: hold the upper part of the \ninhaler with both index fingers and its lower part with both thumbs. \n \nIf you find it difficult to use the inhaler while starting to breathe in, you may use the AeroChamber \nPlus spacer device. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about this device. \nIt is important that you read the package leaflet which is supplied with your AeroChamber Plus spacer \ndevice and that you carefully follow the instructions on how to use the AeroChamber Plus spacer \ndevice and how to clean it. \n \nCleaning of the Trimbow inhaler \nYou should clean your inhaler once a week.  \n1. Do not remove the pressurised container from the inhaler and do not use water or other liquids to \n\nclean your inhaler. \n2. Remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece by pulling it away from your inhaler. \n3. Wipe inside and outside of the mouthpiece and the inhaler with a clean, dry cloth or tissue. \n4. Replace the mouthpiece cap. \n \nIf you use more Trimbow than you should \nIt is important that you take your dose as advised by your doctor. Do not exceed your prescribed dose \nwithout talking to your doctor. \nIf you use more Trimbow than you should, side effects, as described in section 4, may occur.  \nTell your doctor if you have used more Trimbow than you should and if you experience any of these \nsymptoms. Your doctor may wish to carry out some blood tests. \n \nTell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms.  \n \nIf you forget to use Trimbow \nUse it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the dose you have \nmissed, but just take the next dose at the correct time. Do not double the dose. \n \nIf you stop using Trimbow \nIt is important to use Trimbow every day. Do not stop using Trimbow or lower the dose, even if you are \nfeeling better or you have no symptoms. If you want to do this, talk to your doctor. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nThere is a risk of worsening shortness of breath and wheezing immediately after using Trimbow and \nthis is known as paradoxical bronchospasm (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). If this occurs you \nshould stop using Trimbow and use your quick-acting \u201creliever\u201d inhaler straightaway to treat the \nshortness of breath and wheezing. You should contact your doctor straightaway. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\nTell your doctor immediately \n\u2022 if you experience any allergic reactions like skin allergies, hives, skin itching, skin rash (may \n\naffect up to 1 in 100 people), reddening of the skin, swelling of the skin or mucous membranes \nespecially of the eyes, face, lips and throat (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). \n\n\u2022 if you experience eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or coloured \nimages in association with red eyes.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what trimbow is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "trimbow is a medicine to help breathing that contains the three active substances: beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium. beclometasone dipropionate belongs to a group of medicines called corticosteroids which act to reduce the swelling and irritation in your lungs. formoterol and glycopyrronium are medicines called long-acting bronchodilators. they act in different ways to relax the muscles in your airways, helping to open the airways wider and allowing you to breathe more easily. regular treatment with these three active substances helps to relieve and prevent symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing and cough in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). trimbow can reduce exacerbations (flare-ups) of copd symptoms. copd is a serious long- term disease in which the airways become blocked and air sacs inside the lungs become damaged, leading to difficulty breathing.", "Entity_Recognition": null}, "Section_2": {"Title": "2. what you need to know before you use trimbow", "Section_Content": "do not use trimbow: if you are allergic to beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions: trimbow is used as a maintenance treatment for your copd. do not use this medicine to treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. if your breathing gets worse: if you develop worsening shortness of breath or wheezing (breathing with a whistling sound), straight after inhaling your medicine, stop using trimbow inhaler and use your quick-acting \"reliever\" inhaler straightaway. you should contact your doctor straightaway. your doctor will assess your symptoms and if necessary may start you on a different treatment. see also section 4, \"possible side effects\". if your copd gets worse: if your symptoms get worse or are difficult to control (e.g. if you are using a separate \"reliever\" inhaler more frequently) or if your \"reliever\" inhaler does not improve your symptoms, see your doctor immediately. your copd may be getting worse and your doctor may need to prescribe different treatment. talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using trimbow: if you have any heart problems, such as angina (heart pain, pain in the chest), a recent heart attack (myocardial infarction), heart failure, narrowing of the arteries around your heart (coronary heart disease), disease of your heart valves or any other abnormalities of your heart or if you have a condition known as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (also known as hocm, a condition where the heart muscle is abnormal). if you have disorders of your heart rhythm such as irregular heart rate, a fast pulse rate or palpitations or if you have been told that your heart trace (ecg) is abnormal. if you have narrowing of the arteries (also known as arteriosclerosis), if you have high blood pressure or if you have an aneurysm (abnormal bulging of the blood vessel wall). if you have an overactive thyroid gland. if you have low blood levels of potassium (hypokalaemia). the combination of trimbow with some other copd medicines or medicines such as diuretics (medicines that make the body lose water, to treat heart disease or high blood pressure), can cause a sharp fall in your blood level of potassium. therefore, your doctor may wish to measure the potassium levels in your blood from time to time. if you have any disease of your liver or kidneys. if you have diabetes. high doses of formoterol may increase your blood glucose and therefore you may need to have extra blood tests to check your blood sugar when you start using this medicine, and from time to time during treatment. if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as a phaeochromocytoma). if you are due to have an anaesthetic. depending on the type of anaesthetic, it may be necessary to stop using trimbow at least 12 hours before the anaesthesia. if you are being, or have ever been, treated for tuberculosis (tb) or if you have a chest infection. if you have an eye problem called narrow-angle glaucoma. if you have difficulty passing urine. if you have an infection of the mouth or throat. if any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor before you use trimbow. if you have or have had any medical problems or any allergies or if you are not sure if you can use trimbow, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using the inhaler. if you are already using trimbow if you are using trimbow or high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids over long periods and you come into a situation of stress (e.g. being taken to hospital after an accident, having a serious injury or before an operation) you may need more of this medicine. in such a situation, your doctor may need to increase your dose of corticosteroids to cope with the stress and may prescribe them as tablets or injections. contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. children and adolescents do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. other medicines and trimbow tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. this includes medicines similar to trimbow used for your lung disease. some medicines may increase the effects of trimbow and your doctor may wish to monitor you carefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for hiv: ritonavir, cobicistat). do not use this medicine with a beta-blocker medicine (used for treating certain heart problems such as angina or for reducing blood pressure) unless your doctor has chosen a beta-blocker that does not affect your breathing. beta-blockers (including beta-blocker eye-drops) may reduce the effects of formoterol or make it not work at all. on the other hand, using other beta2-agonist medicines (which work in the same way as formoterol) may increase the effects of formoterol. using trimbow together with: medicines for treating - abnormal heart rhythms (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide), - allergic reactions (antihistamines), - symptoms of depression or mental disorders such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (for example phenelzine and isocarboxazid), tricyclic antidepressants (for example amitriptyline and imipramine), phenothiazines can cause some changes in the electrocardiogram (ecg, heart trace). they may also increase the risk of disturbances of heart rhythm (ventricular arrhythmias). medicines for treating parkinson's disease (levodopa), to treat an underactive thyroid gland (levothyroxine), medicines containing oxytocin (which causes uterine contraction) and alcohol can increase the chances of formoterol side effects on the heart. monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois), including medicines with similar properties like furazolidone and procarbazine, used to treat mental disorders, can cause a rise in blood pressure. medicines for treating heart disease (digoxin) can cause a fall in your blood potassium level. this may increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms. other medicines used to treat copd (theophylline, aminophylline or corticosteroids) and diuretics may also cause a fall in your potassium level. some anaesthetics can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. disulfiram, a medicine used in the treatment of people with alcoholism (drinking problems) or metronidazole, an antibiotic to treat infection in your body can cause side effects (e.g. feeling sick, being sick, stomach pain) due to the small amount of alcohol in trimbow. pregnancy and breast-feeding if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. you should only use trimbow during pregnancy if you are advised to do so by your doctor. it is preferable to avoid the use of trimbow during labour due to the inhibitory effects of formoterol on uterine contractions. you should not use trimbow during breast-feeding. you and your doctor must make a decision whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from trimbow therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for your child and the benefit of therapy for you. driving and using machines trimbow is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.",

"always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. adults the recommended dose is two puffs in the morning and two puffs in the evening. if you feel that the medicine is not very effective, talk to your doctor. if you have been using a different inhaler containing beclometasone dipropionate previously, ask your doctor for advice, as the effective dose of beclometasone dipropionate in trimbow for the treatment of copd may be lower than that of some other inhalers. route of administration trimbow is for inhalation use. you should inhale the medicine through your mouth and this takes the medicine directly into your lungs. this medicine is contained in a pressurised container in a plastic inhaler with a mouthpiece. trimbow is available in three container sizes: a container providing 60 puffs a container providing 120 puffs a container providing 180 puffs. if you have been prescribed a container providing 60 puffs or 120 puffs there is a counter on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. each time you press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the counter will count down by one. take care not to drop the inhaler as this may cause the counter to count down. if you have been prescribed a container providing 180 puffs there is an indicator on the back of the inhaler, which tells you how many doses are left. each time you press the pressurised container, a puff of medicine is released and the dose indicator rotates by a small amount. the number of puffs remaining is displayed in intervals of 20. take care not to drop the inhaler as this may cause the dose indicator to count down. testing your inhaler before using the inhaler for the first time, you should test your inhaler to make sure that it is working properly, as follows. 1. depending on the container size prescribed to you, check that the dose counter reads 61 or 121 and that the dose indicator reads 180 2. remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece 3. hold your inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom 4. direct the mouthpiece away from yourself and firmly press the pressurised container to release one puff 5. check the dose counter or dose indicator. if you are testing your inhaler for the first time, the counter should read: 60 - when using the container providing 60 puffs 120 - when using the container providing 120 puffs 180 - when using the container providing 180 puffs how to use your inhaler stand or sit up when inhaling. important: do not perform steps 2 to 5 too quickly. 1. remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece and check that the mouthpiece is clean and free from dust and dirt. 2. breathe out as slowly and deeply as possible, in order to empty your lungs. 3. hold the inhaler upright with the mouthpiece at the bottom and place the mouthpiece between your teeth without biting it. then place your lips around the mouthpiece, with the tongue flat under it. 4. breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth to fill your lungs with air (this should take about 45 seconds). just after starting to breathe in, press down firmly on the top of the pressurised container to release one puff. 5. hold your breath for as long as possible and, finally, remove the inhaler from your mouth and breathe out slowly. do not breathe out into the inhaler. 6. check that the dose counter (60/120 puffs) has moved down by one or that the dose indicator (180 puffs) has rotated by a small amount. for the second puff, keep the inhaler in the upright position for about half a minute, then repeat steps 2 to 5. if you see 'mist' coming from the top of the inhaler or the sides of your mouth, this means that trimbow will not be getting into your lungs as it should. take another puff, following the instructions starting again from step 2. after use, replace the protective cap. to prevent a fungal infection in the mouth and throat, rinse your mouth or gargle with water without swallowing it or brush your teeth after each use of your inhaler. when to get a new inhaler you should get a replacement when the counter or indicator shows the number 20. stop using the inhaler when the counter or indicator shows 0, as any medicine left in the inhaler may not be enough to give you a full puff. if you have a weak grip, it may be easier to hold the inhaler with both hands: hold the upper part of the inhaler with both index fingers and its lower part with both thumbs. if you find it difficult to use the inhaler while starting to breathe in, you may use the aerochamber plus spacer device. ask your doctor or pharmacist about this device. it is important that you read the package leaflet which is supplied with your aerochamber plus spacer device and that you carefully follow the instructions on how to use the aerochamber plus spacer device and how to clean it. cleaning of the trimbow inhaler you should clean your inhaler once a week. 1. do not remove the pressurised container from the inhaler and do not use water or other liquids to clean your inhaler. 2. remove the protective cap from the mouthpiece by pulling it away from your inhaler. 3. wipe inside and outside of the mouthpiece and the inhaler with a clean, dry cloth or tissue. 4. replace the mouthpiece cap. if you use more trimbow than you should it is important that you take your dose as advised by your doctor. do not exceed your prescribed dose without talking to your doctor. if you use more trimbow than you should, side effects, as described in section 4, may occur. tell your doctor if you have used more trimbow than you should and if you experience any of these symptoms. your doctor may wish to carry out some blood tests. tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. if you forget to use trimbow use it as soon as you remember. if it is almost time for your next dose, do not take the dose you have missed, but just take the next dose at the correct time. do not double the dose. if you stop using trimbow it is important to use trimbow every day. do not stop using trimbow or lower the dose, even if you are feeling better or you have no symptoms. if you want to do this, talk to your doctor. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist", "Entity_Recognition":

"Section_Content": "like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. there is a risk of worsening shortness of breath and wheezing immediately after using trimbow and this is known as paradoxical bronchospasm (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). if this occurs you should stop using trimbow and use your quick-acting \"reliever\" inhaler straightaway to treat the shortness of breath and wheezing. you should contact your doctor straightaway. tell your doctor immediately if you experience any allergic reactions like skin allergies, hives, skin itching, skin rash (may affect up to 1 in 100 people), reddening of the skin, swelling of the skin or mucous membranes especially of the eyes, face, lips and throat (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). if you experience eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or coloured images in association with red eyes. these may be signs of an acute attack of narrow-angle glaucoma (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). tell your doctor if you have any of the following while using trimbow as they could be symptoms of a lung infection (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): fever or chills increased mucus production, change in mucus colour increased cough or increased breathing difficulties. possible side effects are listed below according to their frequency. common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): sore throat runny or stuffy nose and sneezing fungal infections of the mouth. rinsing your mouth or gargling with water and brushing your teeth immediately after inhalation may help to prevent these side effects hoarseness headache urinary tract infection. uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): flu inflammation of the sinuses itchy, runny or blocked nose fungal infections of the throat or of the food pipe (oesophagus) fungal infections of the vagina restlessness trembling dizziness abnormal or reduced sense of taste numbness inflammation of the ear irregular heart beat changes in the electrocardiogram (heart trace) unusually fast heart beat and disorders of the heart rhythm palpitations (feeling of abnormal beating of the heart) reddening of the face increased blood flow to some tissues in the body cough and productive cough irritation of the throat nose bleeds dry mouth diarrhoea swallowing difficulties feeling sick upset stomach stomach discomfort after meals burning sensation of the lips tooth decay skin rash, hives, skin itching inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth with or without ulcers increased sweating muscle cramps and pain in muscles pain in arms or legs pain in muscles, bones or joints of the chest tiredness increase of blood pressure fall in the level of some constituents of your blood: of certain white blood cells called granulocytes, of potassium or of cortisol increase in the level of some constituents of your blood: glucose, c-reactive protein, number of platelets, insulin, free fatty acid or ketones. rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): fungal infections of the chest decreased appetite sleep disorders (sleeping too little or too long) crushing chest pain sensation of a missed heart beat, unusually slow heart beat leakage of blood from a vessel into the tissues surrounding it decrease of blood pressure weakness pain in the back of the mouth and throat inflammation and redness of the pharynx dry throat painful and frequent urination difficulty and pain when passing urine inflammation of the kidneys. very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): low level in the number of certain blood cells called platelets feeling breathless or short of breath swelling of the hands and feet growth retardation in children and adolescents. not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): blurred vision. using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids over a long time can cause in very rare cases effects on the body: problems with how your adrenal glands work (adrenal suppression) decrease in bone mineral density (thinning of the bones) clouding of the lens of your eyes (cataract). trimbow does not contain a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, but your doctor may wish to measure the cortisol levels in your blood from time to time. the following side effects can also occur with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids used over a long time, but the frequency is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data) at present: depression feeling worried, nervous, over-excited or irritable. these events are more likely to occur in children. reporting of side effects if you get any side effects talk to your doctor or pharmacist. this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. you can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in appendix v. by reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "trimbow", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME",
