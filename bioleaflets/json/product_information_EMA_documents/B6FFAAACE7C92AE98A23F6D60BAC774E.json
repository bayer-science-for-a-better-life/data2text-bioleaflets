NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAmyvid 800 MBq/mL solution for injection \nAmyvid 1,900 MBq/mL solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAmyvid 800 MBq/mL solution for injection \n \nEach mL of solution for injection contains 800 MBq of florbetapir (18F) at the date and time of \ncalibration (ToC). \nThe activity per vial ranges from 800 MBq to 12,000 MBq at the ToC. \n \nAmyvid 1,900 MBq/mL solution for injection \n \nEach mL of solution for injection contains 1,900 MBq of florbetapir (18F) at the ToC.  \nThe activity per vial ranges from 1,900 MBq to 28,500 MBq at the ToC.  \n \nFluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of approximately 110 minutes by emitting \na positron radiation of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiation of 511 keV. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach dose contains up to 790 mg of ethanol and 37 mg of sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection. \n \nClear, colourless solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n \nAmyvid is a radiopharmaceutical indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of \nβ-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are \nbeing evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. Amyvid \nshould be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation.  \n \nA negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD. For the \nlimitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nA PET scan with florbetapir (18F) should be requested by physicians skilled in the clinical \nmanagement of neurodegenerative disorders. \n \nAmyvid images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with \nflorbetapir (18F). A recent co-registered computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance (MR) \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\nimaging of the patient to get a fused PET-CT or PET-MR image is recommended in cases of \nuncertainty about the location of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border in the PET scan (see \nsection 4.4. Image interpretation).  \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended activity for an adult weighing 70 kg is 370 MBq florbetapir (18F). The volume of \nthe injection should not be less than 1 mL and not exceed 10 mL. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is recommended based on age. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nCareful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible in these patients (see section 4.4). \n \nExtensive dose-range and adjustment studies with the medicinal product in normal and special \npopulations have not been performed. The pharmacokinetics of florbetapir (18F) in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment have not been characterised. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Amyvid in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nAmyvid is for intravenous use and multidose use. \n \nThe activity of florbetapir (18F) has to be measured with an activimeter (dose calibrator) immediately \nprior to injection.  \n \nThe dose is administered by intravenous bolus injection, followed by a flush of sodium chloride \n9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full delivery of the dose. \n \nInjection of florbetapir (18F) through a short intravenous catheter (approximately 4 cm or less) \nminimises the potential for adsorption of the active substance to the catheter. \n \nThe injection of florbetapir (18F) must be intravenous in order to avoid irradiation as a result of local \nextravasation, as well as imaging artefacts. \n \nImage acquisition \nA 10 minute PET image should be acquired starting approximately 30 to 50 minutes after intravenous \ninjection of Amyvid. Patients should be supine with the head positioned to centre the brain, including \nthe cerebellum, in the PET scanner field of view. Reducing head movement with tape or other flexible \nhead restraints may be employed. Reconstruction should include attenuation correction with resulting \ntransaxial pixel sizes between 2.0 and 3.0 mm. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nLimitations of use \n \nA positive scan does not independently establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder since \nneuritic plaque deposition in grey matter may be present in asymptomatic elderly and some \nneurodegenerative dementias (Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson’s disease \ndementia).  \n \nFor the limitations of use in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), see section 5.1. \n \nThe efficacy of Amyvid for predicting development of AD or monitoring response to therapy has not \nbeen established (see section 5.1). \n \nSome scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or \nimage blur, which could lead to interpretation errors. For cases in which there is uncertainty about the \nlocation of grey matter and of the grey/white matter border on the PET scan, and a co-registered recent \nCT or MR image is available, the interpreter should examine the fused PET-CT or PET-MR image to \nclarify the relationship of the PET radioactivity and the grey matter anatomy. \n \nIncreased uptake has been identified in extracerebral structures such as salivary glands, skin, muscles \nand bone in some cases (see section 5.2). Examination of sagittal images and co-registered CT or MR \nimages could help to distinguish occipital bone from occipital grey matter. \n \nIndividual benefit/risk justification \n \nFor each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity \nadministered should, in every case, be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required \ndiagnostic information. \n \nRenal impairment and hepatic impairment \n \nCareful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation \nexposure is possible. Florbetapir (18F) is excreted primarily through the hepatobiliary system and \npatients with hepatic impairment have the potential of increased radiation exposure (see section 4.2). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nFor information on the use in the paediatric population, see sections 4.2 or 5.1. \n \nInterpretation of Amyvid images \n \nAmyvid images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with \nflorbetapir (18F). A negative scan indicates sparse or no density of cortical β-amyloid plaques. A \npositive scan indicates moderate to frequent density. Image interpretation errors in the estimation of \nbrain β-amyloid neuritic plaque density, including false negatives, have been observed.  \n \nReview of images should be primarily in the transaxial orientation with access as needed to the sagittal \nand coronal planes. It is recommended that review of images include all transaxial slices of the brain \nusing a black-white scale with the maximum intensity of the scale set to the maximum intensity of all \nbrain pixels.  \n \nInterpretation of the image as negative or positive is made by visually comparing the activity in \ncortical grey matter with activity in adjacent white matter (see Figure 1). \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nNegative scans have more activity in white matter than in grey matter, creating clear grey-white \ncontrast. Positive scans will have either: \n\na) Two or more brain areas (each larger than a single cortical gyrus) in which there is reduced \nor absent grey-white contrast. This is the most common appearance of a positive scan; or \n\nb) One or more areas in which grey matter activity is intense and clearly exceeds activity in \nadjacent white matter. \n\n \nFigure 1: Amyvid PET cases showing examples of negative scans (top two rows) and positive \nscans (bottom two rows). Left to right panels show sagittal, coronal, and transverse PET image \nslices. Final panel to right shows enlarged picture of the brain area in the box. The top two \narrows are pointing to normal preserved grey-white contrast with the cortical activity less than \nthe adjacent white matter. The bottom two arrows indicate areas of decreased grey-white \ncontrast with increased cortical activity that is comparable to the activity in the adjacent white \nmatter. \n \n\n \n \n\n \nAdjunctive use of quantitative information for image interpretation: \nAdjunctive use of amyloid PET quantitative information should only be used by readers trained in the \napplication of quantitative information to aid visual image interpretation, including recommendations \nfor selection of appropriate software to support the methods. Incorporation of quantitative information \ngenerated by CE-marked image quantitation software as an adjunct to the visual interpretation method \nmay improve readers’ accuracy. Readers should visually interpret the scan, then perform quantitation \naccording to manufacturer’s instructions, including quality checks of the quantitative process, and \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\ncompare quantitation of scan with typical ranges for negative and positive scans. If the quantitation \nresult is inconsistent with the initial visual interpretation: \n\n1. The spatial normalisation and fit of the scan to the template should be re-checked to confirm the \naccuracy of the placement of the regions of interest (ROIs), search for CSF or bone within the \nROI, and evaluate the potential impact of atrophy or ventriculomegaly on quantitation. \n\n2. The basis for making a visual positive or negative determination should be reviewed: \na. In the case of an amyloid positive initial visual read and negative quantitation, the \n\nphysician should consider whether the positive visual interpretation might be based on \ntracer retention in regions outside the ROIs that contribute to the cortical average \nstandardised uptake value ratio (SUVR). \n\nb. In the case of an amyloid negative initial visual read and an amyloid positive quantitation, \nthe regions corresponding to the ROIs with elevated SUVR should be examined to \ndetermine whether there is a loss of grey/white contrast in these areas. \n\n3. The cerebellum region should be examined to confirm the fit of the ROI and the level of \ngrey/white contrast, which provides a standard for visual comparison to cortex. Possible \nstructural anomalies that could influence quantitation of the cerebellar region should be \nconsidered. \n\n4. A final interpretation of the scan should be made based on the final visual read after conducting \nresolution steps 1-3 above. \n\n \nAfter the procedure \n \nClose contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the initial 24 hours \nfollowing the injection. \n \nSodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains up to 37 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 1.85 % of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \nEthanol \n \nThis medicinal product contains 790 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 10 mL dose, which is equivalent \nto 11.3 mg/kg (administered to an adult with 70 kg). The amount in 10 mL of this medicinal product is \nequivalent to less than 20 mL beer or 8 mL wine.  \nThe small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable effects. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo in vivo interaction studies have been performed.  \n \nIn vitro binding studies have not shown interference of florbetapir (18F) binding to β-amyloid plaques \nin the presence of other common medicinal products taken by AD patients. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential  \n \nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \nwoman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using \nionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\nPregnancy \n \nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. \nOnly essential investigations should therefore be carried out during pregnancy, when the likely benefit \nfar exceeds the risk incurred by the mother and foetus. \nNo studies have been conducted in pregnant women. No animal studies have been conducted to \ninvestigate the reproductive effects of florbetapir (18F) (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether florbetapir (18F) is excreted in human milk during breast-feeding. Before \nadministering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breast-feeding consideration should be given to \nthe possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased \nbreast-feeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind \nthe secretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding \nshould be interrupted for 24 hours and the expressed feeds discarded.  \n \nClose contact with infants should be restricted during the initial 24 hours following injection. \n \nFertility \n \nNo studies on fertility have been performed. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAmyvid has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile of Amyvid is based on its administrations to 2,105 subjects in clinical trials. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nFrequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n(≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data). While they may in reality occur at lower frequencies than indicated \nbelow, the size of the source database did not allow for the assignment of frequency categories lower \nthan the category “uncommon” (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). \n \n\nSystem organ class Common Uncommon \nNervous system disorders \n \n\nHeadache Dysgeusia \n\nVascular disorders \n \n\n Flushing \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n \n\n Nausea \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n \n\n Pruritus \nUrticaria \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n \n\n Injection site reactiona \nInfusion site rash \n\naInjection site reaction includes injection site haemorrhage, injection site irritation, and injection site \npain \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \nhereditary defects. As the effective dose is 7 mSv when the recommended activity of 370 MBq of \nflorbetapir (18F) is administered, these adverse reactions are expected to occur with low probability.  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nDue to the small quantity of florbetapir (18F) in each dose, overdose is not expected to result in \npharmacological effects. In the event of administration of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to \nthe patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from \nthe body by frequent micturition and defaecation. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that \nwas applied. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, central nervous system, ATC code: \nV09AX05 \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nFlorbetapir (18F) binds to β-amyloid neuritic plaques. Binding studies using traditional \nneuropathological staining methods in post-mortem AD brains demonstrated statistically significant \n(p < 0.0001) correlations between in vitro florbetapir (18F) binding and β-amyloid aggregate \ndeposition. In vivo, correlation was assessed in end-of-life patients between florbetapir (18F) uptake in \ncortical grey matter and the total β-amyloid burden using 4G8 anti-amyloid antibody that stains \nβ-amyloid found in both neuritic and diffuse plaques. The in vivo binding of florbetapir (18F) to other \nβ-amyloid structures or other brain structures or receptors remains unknown. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAt the low chemical concentrations present in Amyvid, florbetapir (18F) does not have any detectable \npharmacological activity.  \n \nIn completed clinical trials, uptake of florbetapir (18F) in 6 predefined cortical areas of the brain \n(precuneus, frontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, parietal and temporal) was measured \nquantitatively using standardised uptake values (SUV). Cortical average SUV ratios (SUVRs, relative \nto cerebellum) are higher in AD patients compared with those of healthy volunteer subjects. The \naverage cortical to cerebellar SUVR values in AD patients show continual substantial increases from \ntime zero through 30 minutes post-administration, with only small changes thereafter up to 90 minutes \npost-injection. No differences in SUVR results were noted in subjects taking common AD treatments \nrelative to those not taking AD treatments. \n \nClinical efficacy  \n \nA pivotal study in 59 end-of-life patients was aimed at establishing the diagnostic performance of \nAmyvid to detect the cortical neuritic plaque density (no or sparse vs. moderate or frequent). The PET \nresults were compared with the maximal neuritic plaque density measured on sections of frontal, \ntemporal or parietal cortex at the patient’s autopsy within 24 months of PET scan. The cognitive status \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\nof the subjects could not be reliably measured. In all 59 subjects, a blinded PET reading by 5 nuclear \nmedicine physicians resulted in a majority read sensitivity of 92% (95% CI: 78-98%) and specificity \nof 100% (95% CI: 80-100%). In a study of 47 young (<40 years) healthy volunteers, presumed to be \nfree of β-amyloid, all Amyvid PET scans were negative. \n \nSensitivity and specificity to detect the cortical neuritic plaque density of Amyvid was further \ninvestigated in two additional studies, in which different sets of readers interpreted images from some \nsubjects followed to autopsy in the pivotal study. Their results closely paralleled the results obtained in \nthe pivotal trial. Inter-rater agreement using Fleiss’ kappa values ranged from 0.75 to 0.85.  \n \nIn a longitudinal study, 142 subjects (clinically diagnosed as MCI, AD or cognitively normal) \nunderwent baseline florbetapir (18F) PET scans, and were followed for 3 years to evaluate the \nrelationship between Amyvid imaging and changes in diagnostic status.  \n \nDiagnostic performance values of florbetapir (18F) PET are tabulated below: \n \n\n Agreement with baseline \ndiagnosis of MCI \n\nAgreement with baseline \ndiagnosis of clinical AD \n\n N=51 N=31 \n\nSensitivity 19/51 = 37.3% \n(95% CI: 24.1-51.9%) \n\n21/31 = 67.7% \n(95% CI: 51.3-84.2%) \n\nSpecificity \n\nUsing non-MCI cases \n(cognitively normal & clinical AD) \n\n69/100 = 69.0% \n(95% CI: 59.9-78.1%) \n\nUsing non-AD cases \n(cognitively normal & MCI) \n\n91/120 = 75.8% \n(95% CI: 68.2-83.5%) \n\nPositive  \nlikelihood ratio 1.20 (95% CI: 0.76-1.91) 2.80 (95% CI: 1.88-4.18) \n\n \n \nOf the patients who had been clinically diagnosed with MCI at study entry, 9 (19%) converted to \nclinical AD 36 months later. Of the 17 MCI patients who had a positive PET scan, 6 (35%) were \ndiagnosed with clinical probable AD 36 months later compared to 3 (10%) of 30 who had a negative \nscan. Sensitivity of Amyvid scan to show the MCI conversion rate to AD in 9 converters was 66.7% \n(95% CI: 35-88%), specificity in 38 non-converters was 71.0% (95% CI: 55-83%) and positive \nlikelihood ratio was 2.31 (95% CI: 1.2-4.5). The design of this study does not allow estimating the risk \nof MCI progression to clinical AD. \n \nAdjunctive use of quantitative information for image interpretation  \nThe feasibility and reliability of using CE-marked quantitative software as an adjunct to clinical \nqualitative interpretation was investigated in two studies using three different commercially available \nquantitative software packages. Participating readers first evaluated a set of 96 PET scans, including \n46 scans with autopsy standard of truth, using the visual qualitative read method to establish a baseline \nand were subsequently asked to re-evaluate the same set of scans with or without access to quantitative \nsoftware information. Across all participating readers who had access to quantitative information, \naverage reader accuracy on the scans with autopsy standard of truth improved from 90.1% at baseline \nto 93.1% (p-value <0.0001), with no observed decrease in either sensitivity or specificity. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nAmyvid in all subsets of the paediatric population as there is no intended use in the paediatric \npopulation. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 10 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDistribution  \n \nFlorbetapir (18F) is distributed throughout the body within several minutes of injection, and then is \nrapidly metabolised.  \n \nOrgan uptake \n \nMaximal brain uptake of florbetapir (18F) occurs within several minutes of injection, followed by rapid \nbrain clearance during the first 30 minutes following injection. The organs of greatest exposure are \norgans of elimination, mainly the gallbladder, liver, and intestines.  \n \nHealthy controls show relatively low levels of florbetapir (18F) retention in cortex and cerebellum. \nRegional analyses show slightly higher levels of retention in the caudate, putamen and hippocampus. \nThe highest level of uptake is in regions mainly composed of white matter (pons and centrum \nsemiovale). In AD subjects, cortical regions and putamen show significantly greater uptake compared \nto controls. In AD subjects, as in controls, there is low retention in cerebellum and hippocampus and \nhigh retention in pons and centrum semiovale. \n \nThe biophysical basis of the white matter retention of florbetapir (18F) in the living human brain \ncannot be definitively explained. It is hypothesised that slower clearance of the radiopharmaceutical \nmay contribute to white matter retention since regional cerebral blood flow in white matter is less than \nhalf of that of cortex. Uptake has also been identified in some cases in extracerebral structures such as \nscalp, salivary glands, muscles and cranial bone. The reason for this uptake is unknown, but may be \ndue to accumulation of florbetapir (18F) or to any of its radioactive metabolites or to blood \nradioactivity. \n \nElimination \n \nElimination occurs primarily by clearance through the liver and excretion into the gallbladder and the \nintestines. Some accumulation/excretion is also observed in the urinary bladder. Radioactivity in urine \nis present as polar metabolites of florbetapir (18F). \n \nHalf-life \n \nFlorbetapir (18F) is very rapidly cleared from circulation post-intravenous injection. Less than 5% of \nthe injected 18F radioactivity remains in blood 20 minutes following administration, and less than 2% \nis present 45 minutes after administration. The residual 18F in circulation during the 30-90 minute \nimaging window is principally in the form of polar 18F species. The radioactive half-life of 18F is \n110 minutes.  \n \nRenal/hepatic impairment \n \nThe pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been characterised. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nAnimal toxicology and safety pharmacology \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology and single and repeated dose toxicity, in which florbetapir [the non-radioactive form of \nflorbetapir (18F)] was used. An acute dose study was conducted in rats, and the NOAEL (no \nobservable adverse effect level) was determined to be at least 100 times maximum human dose. The \npotential toxicity of 28 days of repeated intravenous injections of florbetapir was tested in rats and \ndogs, and the NOAEL was found to be at least 25 times the maximum human dose. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 11 \n\nIn an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), increases in the number of revertant \ncolonies were observed in 2 of the 5 strains exposed to florbetapir. In a chromosomal aberration in \nvitro study with cultured human peripheral lymphocyte cells, florbetapir did not increase the percent \nof cells with structural aberrations with 3 hour exposure with or without activation; however, 22 hour \nexposure produced an increase in structural aberrations at all tested concentrations. Potential in vivo \ngenotoxicity of florbetapir was evaluated in a rat micronucleus study. In this assay, florbetapir did not \nincrease the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes at the highest achievable dose \nlevel, 372 µg/kg/day, when given twice daily for 3 consecutive days. This dose is approximately \n500 times the maximum human dose, and showed no evidence of mutagenicity. \n \nNo studies have been conducted in animals to investigate the potential long term carcinogenicity, \nfertility, or reproductive effects of florbetapir (18F). \n \nNo animal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have been performed with florbetapir (18F). \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.  \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Amyvid is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before Amyvid is used \n3. How Amyvid will be used \n4. Possible side effects \n5 How Amyvid is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Amyvid is and what it is used for  \n \nThis medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. \n \nAmyvid contains the active substance florbetapir (18F). \n \nAmyvid is given to adults with memory problems so that doctors can perform a type of brain scan, \ncalled a PET scan. Amyvid, along with other brain function tests, may help your doctor find the reason \nfor your memory problems. An Amyvid PET scan can help your doctor determine whether or not you \nmay have β-amyloid plaques in your brain. β-amyloid plaques are deposits present in the brains of \npeople with Alzheimer’s disease, but may also be present in the brain of people with other dementias.  \nYou should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. \n \nThe use of Amyvid does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the \nnuclear medicine doctor have considered that the benefit of this procedure with the \nradiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to radiation.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before Amyvid is used  \n \nAmyvid must not be used \n- if you are allergic to florbetapir (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Amyvid if you: \n- have kidney problems \n- have liver problems \n- are pregnant or think you may be pregnant  \n- are breast-feeding \n \nChildren and adolescents \nAmyvid is not intended for use in children and adolescents. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 30 \n\nOther medicines and Amyvid  \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images obtained from the brain scan. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Amyvid if there is a possibility you \nmight be pregnant, if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. When in doubt, it is \nimportant to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the procedure.  \n \nIf you are pregnant \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will only give this medicine during pregnancy if a benefit is expected \nwhich would outweigh the risks.  \n \nIf you are breast-feeding \nYou must stop breast-feeding for 24 hours after the injection and the maternal milk pumped must be \ndiscarded. Resuming breast-feeding should be in agreement with the nuclear medicine doctor who will \nsupervise the procedure.  \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.  \n \nDriving and using machines  \nAmyvid will not affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \nAmyvid contains ethanol and sodium \nThis medicine contains 790 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 10 mL dose, which is equivalent to \n11.3 mg/kg (administered to an adult with 70 kg). The amount in 10 mL of this medicine is equivalent \nto less than 20 mL beer or 8 mL wine.  \nThe small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects. \n \nThis medicine also contains up to 37 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. \nThis is equivalent to 1.85 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an \nadult. \n \n \n3. How Amyvid will be used  \n \nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products.  \nAmyvid will only be used in specially controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given \nto you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for \nthe safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.  \n \nDose \nThe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Amyvid to be \nused in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information.  \n \nThe usual amount recommended for an adult is 370 MBq. Megabecquerel (MBq) is the unit used to \nexpress radioactivity. \n \nAdministration of Amyvid and conduct of the procedure  \nAmyvid is given as an injection into your vein (intravenous injection) followed by a flush of sodium \nchloride solution to ensure full delivery of the dose.  \n \nOne injection is usually sufficient to carry out the scan that your doctor needs. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 31 \n\nDuration of the procedure  \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. A brain scan \nis usually taken about 30 to 50 minutes after the Amyvid injection is given. \n \nAfter administration of Amyvid, you should  \nAvoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for the 24 hours following the \ninjection. \n \nThe nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after \nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.  \n \nIf you have been given more Amyvid than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Amyvid precisely controlled by \nthe nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, you will \nreceive the appropriate treatment. In particular, the nuclear medicine doctor in charge of the procedure \nmay provide ways to increase the passing of urine and stools in order to help remove radioactivity \nfrom your body. \n \nIf you have any further question on the use of Amyvid, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor who \nsupervises the procedure. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effect of Amyvid is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n- headache \nThe following side effects of Amyvid are uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people):  \n- feeling sick, \n- altered taste, \n- flushing, \n- itching, \n- rash, bleeding or pain where the injection is given or rash in other places. \n \nThis radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk \nof cancer and hereditary abnormalities (i.e. genetic diseases).
