NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nFaslodex 250 mg solution for injection.\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nOne pre-filled syringe contains 250 mg fulvestrant in 5 ml solution.\n\nExcipients with known effect (per 5 ml)\nEthanol (96%, 500 mg)\nBenzyl alcohol (500 mg)\nBenzyl benzoate (750 mg)\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nSolution for injection.\n\nClear, colourless to yellow, viscous solution.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFaslodex is indicated:\n as monotherapy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic \n\nbreast cancer in postmenopausal women: \n- not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or\n- with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on \n\nantiestrogen therapy.\n in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human \n\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast \ncancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1).\n\nIn pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined \nwith a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nPosology\nAdult females (including Elderly)\nThe recommended dose is 500 mg at intervals of one month, with an additional 500 mg dose given \ntwo weeks after the initial dose.\n\nWhen Faslodex is used in combination with palbociclib, please also refer to the Summary of Product\nCharacteristics of palbociclib.\n\nPrior to the start of treatment with the combination of Faslodex plus palbociclib, and throughout its \nduration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated with LHRH agonists according to local clinical \npractice.\n\n\n\n3\n\nSpecial populations\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 30 ml/min). Safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in patients with severe renal \nimpairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), and, therefore, caution is recommended in these \npatients (see section 4.4).\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. \nHowever, as fulvestrant exposure may be increased, Faslodex should be used with caution in these \npatients. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Faslodex in children from birth to 18 years of age have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made.\n\nMethod of administration\nFaslodex should be administered as two consecutive 5 ml injections by slow intramuscular injection \n(1-2 minutes/injection), one in each buttock (gluteal area).\n\nCaution should be taken if injecting Faslodex at the dorsogluteal site due to the proximity of the \nunderlying sciatic nerve.\n\nFor detailed instructions for administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\nPregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6).\nSevere hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nFaslodex should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nFaslodex should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \nless than 30 ml/min). \n\nDue to the intramuscular route of administration, Faslodex should be used with caution if treating \npatients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia or those taking anticoagulant treatment.\n\nThromboembolic events are commonly observed in women with advanced breast cancer and have \nbeen observed in clinical studies with Faslodex (see section 4.8). This should be taken into \nconsideration when prescribing Faslodex to patients at risk.\n\nInjection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy \nhave been reported with Faslodex injection. Caution should be taken while administering Faslodex at \nthe dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve (see sections 4.2 and \n4.8).\n\nThere are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. Due to the mechanism of action of \nfulvestrant, there is a potential risk of osteoporosis.\n\n\n\n4\n\nThe efficacy and safety of Faslodex (either as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib) have \nnot been studied in patients with critical visceral disease.\n\nWhen Faslodex is combined with palbociclib, please also refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics of palbociclib.\n\nInterference with estradiol antibody assays\nDue to the structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, fulvestrant may interfere with antibody\nbased-estradiol assays and may result in falsely increased levels of estradiol.\n\nEthanol\nFaslodex contains 10% w/v ethanol (alcohol) as an excipient, i.e. up to 500 mg per injection, \nequivalent to 10 ml beer or 4 ml wine. This may be harmful for those suffering from alcoholism and \nshould be taken into account in high risk groups such as patients with liver disease and epilepsy.\n\nBenzyl alcohol\nFaslodex contains benzyl alcohol as an excipient which may cause allergic reactions.\n\nPaediatric population\nFaslodex is not recommended for use in children and adolescents as safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished in this group of patients (see section 5.1).\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nA clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does \nnot inhibit CYP3A4. Clinical interaction studies with rifampicin (inducer of CYP3A4) and \nketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. \nDose adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and CYP3A4 \ninhibitors or inducers concomitantly.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\nWomen of childbearing potential\nPatients of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Faslodex\nand for 2 years after the last dose.\n\nPregnancy\nFaslodex is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). Fulvestrant has been shown to cross the \nplacenta after single intramuscular doses in rat and rabbit. Studies in animals have shown reproductive \ntoxicity including an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities and deaths (see section 5.3). If \npregnancy occurs while taking Faslodex, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the \nfoetus and potential risk for loss of pregnancy.\n\nBreast-feeding\nBreast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with Faslodex. Fulvestrant is excreted in milk in \nlactating rats. It is not known whether fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. Considering the potential \nfor serious adverse reactions due to fulvestrant in breast-fed infants, use during lactation is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nFertility\nThe effects of Faslodex on fertility in humans has not been studied.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nFaslodex has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, since\nasthenia has been reported very commonly with Faslodex, caution should be observed by those \npatients who experience this adverse reaction when driving or operating machinery.\n\n\n\n5\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\nMonotherapy\nThis section provides information based on all adverse reactions from clinical studies, post-marketing \nstudies or spontaneous reports. In the pooled dataset of fulvestrant monotherapy, the most frequently \nreported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, asthenia, nausea, and increased hepatic \nenzymes (ALT, AST, ALP).\n\nIn Table 1, the following frequency categories for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were calculated \nbased on the Faslodex 500 mg treatment group in pooled safety analyses of studies that compared \nFaslodex 500 mg with Faslodex 250 mg [CONFIRM (Study D6997C00002), FINDER 1 (Study \nD6997C00004), FINDER 2 (Study D6997C00006), and NEWEST (Study D6997C00003) studies], or \nfrom FALCON (Study D699BC00001) alone that compared Faslodex 500 mg with anastrozole 1 mg. \nWhere frequencies differ between the pooled safety analysis and FALCON, the highest frequency is \npresented. The frequencies in Table 1 were based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of \nthe investigator assessment of causality. The median duration of fulvestrant 500 mg treatment across \nthe pooled dataset (including the studies mentioned above plus FALCON) was 6.5 months.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\nAdverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and System Organ Class (SOC). \nFrequency groupings are defined according to the following convention: Very common (≥1/10), \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping \nadverse reactions are reported in order of decreasing seriousness.\n\nTable 1 Adverse Drug Reactions reported in patients treated with Faslodex monotherapy\n\nAdverse reactions by system organ class and frequency\n\nInfections and infestations Common Urinary tract infections\n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Common Reduced platelet counte\n\nImmune system disorders Very common Hypersensitivity reactionse\n\nUncommon Anaphylactic reactions\n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Common Anorexiaa\n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache\n\nVascular disorders Very common Hot flushese\n\nCommon Venous thromboembolisma\n\nGastrointestinal disorders Very common Nausea\n\nCommon Vomiting, diarrhoea\n\nHepatobiliary disorders Very common Elevated hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, \n\nALP)a\n\nCommon Elevated bilirubina\n\nUncommon Hepatic failurec, f, hepatitisf, elevated \n\ngamma-GTf\n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Very common Rashe\n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \n\ndisorders\n\nVery common Joint and musculoskeletal paind\n\nCommon Back paina\n\nReproductive system and breast disorders Common Vaginal haemorrhagee\n\nUncommon Vaginal moniliasisf, leukorrheaf\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions\n\nVery common Astheniaa, injection site reactionsb\n\nCommon Neuropathy peripherale, sciaticae\n\nUncommon Injection site haemorrhagef, injection \n\nsite haematomaf, neuralgiac,f\n\n\n\n6\n\na Includes adverse drug reactions for which the exact contribution of Faslodex cannot be assessed due to the \nunderlying disease.\n\nb The term injection site reactions does not include the terms injection site haemorrhage, injection site \nhaematoma, sciatica, neuralgia and neuropathy peripheral.\n\nc The event was not observed in major clinical studies (CONFIRM, FINDER 1, FINDER 2, NEWEST). The \nfrequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate. \nThis is calculated as 3/560 (where 560 is the number of patients in the major clinical studies), which \nequates to a frequency category of ‘uncommon’.\n\nd Includes: arthralgia, and less frequently musculoskeletal pain, myalgia and pain in extremity.\ne Frequency category differs between pooled safety dataset and FALCON.\nf ADR was not observed in FALCON.\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\nThe descriptions included below are based on the safety analysis set of 228 patients who received at \nleast one (1) dose of fulvestrant and 232 patients who received at least one (1) dose of anastrozole, \nrespectively in the Phase 3 FALCON study.\n\nJoint and musculoskeletal pain\nIn the FALCON study, the number of patients who reported an adverse reaction of joint and\nmusculoskeletal pain was 65 (31.2%) and 48 (24.1%) for fulvestrant and anastrozole arms, \nrespectively. Of the 65 patients in the Faslodex arm, 40% (26/65) of patients reported joint and \nmusculoskeletal pain within the first month of treatment, and 66.2% (43/65) of patients within the first \n3 months of treatment. No patients reported events that were CTCAE Grade ≥3 or that required a dose \nreduction, dose interruption, or discontinued treatment due to these adverse reactions.\n\nCombination therapy with palbociclib\nThe overall safety profile of fulvestrant when used in combination with palbociclib is based on data \nfrom 517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the \nrandomised PALOMA3 study (see section 5.1).  The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of any \ngrade reported in patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib were neutropenia, \nleukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anaemia, stomatitis, diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia and \nvomiting.

In the fulvestrant + \nplacebo arm (n=172), neutropenia of any grade was reported in 6 (3.5%) patients. There were no \nreports of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in the fulvestrant + placebo arm.\n\nIn patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib, the median time to first episode of \nany grade neutropenia was 15 days (range: 13-512 days) and the median duration of Grade ≥3 \nneutropenia was 16 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 3 (0.9%) patients receiving \nfulvestrant in combination with palbociclib.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system\nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere are isolated reports of overdose with Faslodex in humans. If overdose occurs, symptomatic\nsupportive treatment is recommended. Animal studies suggest that no effects other than those related \ndirectly or indirectly to antiestrogenic activity were evident with higher doses of fulvestrant (see \nsection 5.3). \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, Antiestrogens, ATC code: L02BA03 \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects\nFulvestrant is a competitive estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist with an affinity comparable to estradiol. \nFulvestrant blocks the trophic actions of estrogens without any partial agonist (estrogen-like) activity.\nThe mechanism of action is associated with downregulation of estrogen receptor protein levels. \nClinical studies in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer have shown that fulvestrant \nsignificantly downregulates ER protein in ER positive tumours compared with placebo. There was also \na significant decrease in progesterone receptor expression consistent with a lack of intrinsic estrogen\nagonist effects. It has also been shown that fulvestrant 500 mg downregulates ER and the proliferation \nmarker Ki67, to a greater degree than fulvestrant 250 mg in breast tumours in postmenopausal \nneoadjuvant setting.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety in advanced breast cancer\n\nMonotherapy\nA Phase 3 clinical study was completed in 736 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer \nwho had disease recurrence on or after adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression following endocrine \ntherapy for advanced disease. The study included 423 patients whose disease had recurred or \nprogressed during antiestrogen therapy (AE subgroup) and 313 patients whose disease had recurred or \nprogressed during aromatase inhibitor therapy (AI subgroup). This study compared the efficacy and\n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9\n\nsafety of Faslodex 500 mg (n=362) with Faslodex 250 mg (n=374). Progression-free survival (PFS) \nwas the primary endpoint; key secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), \nclinical benefit rate (CBR) and overall survival (OS).

A total of 462 patients were randomised 1:1 sequentially to receive either fulvestrant 500 mg \nor anastrozole 1 mg. Randomisation was stratified by disease setting (locally advanced or metastatic), \nprior chemotherapy for advanced disease, and measurable disease.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of the study was investigator assessed progression-free survival (PFS) \nevaluated according to RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours). Key secondary \nefficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR).\n\nPatients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 36-90). The majority of patients \n(87.0%) had metastatic disease at baseline. Fifty-five percent (55.0%) of patients had visceral \nmetastasis at baseline. A total of 17.1% of patients received a prior chemotherapy regimen for \nadvanced disease; 84.2% of patients had measurable disease.\n\nConsistent results were observed across the majority of pre-specified patient subgroups. For the \nsubgroup of patients with disease limited to non-visceral metastasis (n=208), the HR was 0.592 (95% \nCI: 0.419, 0.837) for the Faslodex arm compared to the anastrozole arm. For the subgroup of patients\nwith visceral metastasis (n=254), the HR was 0.993 (95% CI: 0.740, 1.331) for the Faslodex arm \ncompared to the anastrozole arm.

Seventy seven percent (77%) of the study \npopulation had estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. These studies compared the safety and \nefficacy of monthly administration of Faslodex 250 mg versus the daily administration of 1 mg \nanastrozole (aromatase inhibitor). Overall, Faslodex at the 250 mg monthly dose was at least as \neffective as anastrozole in terms of progression-free survival, objective response, and time to death. \nThere were no statistically significant differences in any of these endpoints between the two treatment \ngroups. Progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. Combined analysis of both studies\nshowed that 83% of patients who received Faslodex progressed, compared with 85% of patients who \nreceived anastrozole. Combined analysis of both studies showed the hazard ratio of Faslodex 250 mg \nto anastrozole for progression-free survival was 0.95 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.10). The objective response \nrate for Faslodex 250 mg was 19.2% compared with 16.5% for anastrozole. The median time to death \nwas 27.4 months for patients treated with Faslodex and 27.6 months for patients treated with \nanastrozole. The hazard ratio of Faslodex 250 mg to anastrozole for time to death was 1.01 (95% CI \n0.86 to 1.19).\n\nCombination therapy with palbociclib\nA Phase 3, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study of Faslodex\n500 mg plus palbociclib 125 mg versus Faslodex 500 mg plus placebo was conducted in women with \nHR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to resection or radiation \ntherapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose \ndisease progressed after prior endocrine therapy in the (neo) adjuvant or metastatic setting.\n\nA total of 521 pre/peri- and postmenopausal women who had progressed on or within 12 months from \ncompletion of adjuvant endocrine therapy on or within 1 month from prior endocrine therapy for \nadvanced disease, were randomised 2:1 to Faslodex plus palbociclib or Faslodex plus placebo and \nstratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry \n(pre/peri- versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. Pre/perimenopausal women \nreceived the LHRH agonist goserelin.

The median age of patients enrolled \nin this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients were \nWhite, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. \nApproximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic \ntherapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for \ntheir primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral metastases,\nand 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. \nSupportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary \nendpoints included OR, CBR, overall survival (OS), safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain \nendpoint.\n\nThe study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis \nconducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the pre-specified Haybittle-Peto \nefficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a \nclinically meaningful treatment effect. A more mature update of efficacy data is reported in Table 5.\n\nAfter a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS analysis was performed based on 310 events\n(60% of randomised patients). A 6.9-month difference in median OS in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant \narm compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant arm was observed; this result was not statistically \nsignificant at the prespecified significance level of 0.0235 (1-sided). In the placebo plus fulvestrant \narm, 15.5% of randomised patients received palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors as post-progression \nsubsequent treatments.\n\nThe results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA3 study are presented \nin Table 5.

There is no evidence of adverse endometrial effects in the breast \ncancer patients studied. No data are available regarding endometrial morphology.\n\nIn two short-term studies (1 and 12 weeks) in premenopausal patients with benign gynaecologic \ndisease, no significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed by ultrasound measurement \nbetween fulvestrant and placebo groups.\n\nEffects on bone\nThere are no long-term data on the effect of fulvestrant on bone. Neoadjuvant treatment for up to \n16 weeks in breast cancer patients with either Faslodex 500 mg or Faslodex 250 mg did not result in \nclinically significant changes in serum bone-turnover markers.\n\nPaediatric population\nFaslodex is not indicated for use in children. The European Medicines Agency has waived the \nobligation to submit the results of studies with Faslodex in all subsets of the paediatric population in \nbreast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).\n\nAn open-label Phase 2 study investigated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant in \n30 girls aged 1 to 8 years with Progressive Precocious Puberty associated with McCune Albright \nSyndrome (MAS). The paediatric patients received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of fulvestrant. \nThis 12-month study investigated a range of MAS endpoints and showed a reduction in the frequency \nof vaginal bleeding and a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement. The steady-state trough \nconcentrations of fulvestrant in children in this study were consistent with that in adults (see \nsection 5.2). There were no new safety concerns arising from this small study, but 5-year data are yet \nnot available.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption \nAfter administration of Faslodex long-acting intramuscular injection, fulvestrant is slowly absorbed \nand maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached after about 5 days. Administration of \nFaslodex 500 mg regimen achieves exposure levels at, or close to, steady state within the first month \nof dosing (mean [CV]: AUC 475 [33.4%] ng.days/ml, Cmax 25.1 [35.3%] ng/ml, Cmin\n16.3 [25.9%] ng/ml, respectively). At steady state, fulvestrant plasma concentrations are maintained \nwithin a relatively narrow range with up to an approximately 3-fold difference between maximum and \ntrough concentrations. After intramuscular administration, the exposure is approximately \ndose-proportional in the dose range 50 to 500 mg.\n\nDistribution\nFulvestrant is subject to extensive and rapid distribution. The large apparent volume of distribution at \nsteady state (Vdss) of approximately 3 to 5 l/kg suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. \nFulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low \ndensity lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions are the major binding \ncomponents. No interaction studies were conducted on competitive protein binding. The role of sex \nhormone-binding globulin (SHBG) has not been determined.\n\nBiotransformation\nThe metabolism of fulvestrant has not been fully evaluated, but involves combinations of a number of \npossible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids. Identified metabolites \n(includes 17-ketone, sulphone, 3-sulphate, 3- and 17-glucuronide metabolites) are either less active or \n\n\n\n17\n\nexhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in antiestrogen models. Studies using human liver preparations \nand recombinant human enzymes indicate that CYP3A4 is the only P450 isoenzyme involved in the \noxidation of fulvestrant; however, non-P450 routes appear to be more predominant in vivo. In vitro\ndata suggest that fulvestrant does not inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes.\n\nElimination\nFulvestrant is eliminated mainly in metabolised form. The major route of excretion is via the faeces, \nwith less than 1% being excreted in the urine. Fulvestrant has a high clearance, 11±1.7 ml/min/kg, \nsuggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio. The terminal half-life (t1/2) after intramuscular \nadministration is governed by the absorption rate and was estimated to be 50 days.\n\nSpecial populations\nIn a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 studies, no difference in fulvestrant’s \npharmacokinetic profile was detected with regard to age (range 33 to 89 years), weight (40-127 kg) or \nrace.\n\nRenal impairment\nMild to moderate impairment of renal function did not influence the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant to \nany clinically relevant extent.\n\nHepatic impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a single-dose clinical study conducted in \nwomen with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B). A high dose of a \nshorter duration intramuscular injection formulation was used. There was up to about 2.5-fold increase \nin AUC in women with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. In patients administered \nFaslodex, an increase in exposure of this magnitude is expected to be well tolerated. Women with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) were not evaluated.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant has been evaluated in a clinical study conducted in 30 girls with\nProgressive Precocious Puberty associated with McCune Albright Syndrome (see section 5.1). The \npaediatric patients were aged 1 to 8 years and received 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of \nfulvestrant. The geometric mean (standard deviation) steady state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) and \nAUCss was 4.2 (0.9) ng/mL and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/mL, respectively. Although the data collected were \nlimited, the steady-state trough concentrations of fulvestrant in children appear to be consistent with \nthose in adults.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nThe acute toxicity of fulvestrant is low.\n\nFaslodex and other formulations of fulvestrant were well tolerated in animal species used in multiple \ndose studies. Local reactions, including myositis and granulomata at the injection site were attributed \nto the vehicle but the severity of myositis in rabbits increased with fulvestrant, compared to the saline \ncontrol. In toxicity studies with multiple intramuscular doses of fulvestrant in rats and dogs, the \nantiestrogenic activity of fulvestrant was responsible for most of the effects seen, particularly in the \nfemale reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones in both sexes. Arteritis \ninvolving a range of different tissues was seen in some dogs after chronic (12 months) dosing.\n\nIn dog studies following oral and intravenous administration, effects on the cardiovascular system \n(slight elevations of the S-T segment of the ECG [oral], and sinus arrest in one dog [intravenous]) \nwere seen. These occurred at exposure levels higher than in patients (Cmax >15 times) and are likely to \nbe of limited significance for human safety at the clinical dose.\n\nFulvestrant showed no genotoxic potential.\n\n\n\n18\n\nFulvestrant showed effects upon reproduction and embryo/foetal development consistent with its \nantiestrogenic activity, at doses similar to the clinical dose. In rats, a reversible reduction in female \nfertility and embryonic survival, dystocia and an increased incidence of foetal abnormalities including \ntarsal flexure were observed. Rabbits given fulvestrant failed to maintain pregnancy. Increases in \nplacental weight and post-implantation loss of foetuses were seen. There was an increased incidence of \nfoetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae).\n\nA two-year oncogenicity study in rats (intramuscular administration of Faslodex) showed increased \nincidence of ovarian benign granulosa cell tumours in female rats at the high dose, 10 mg/rat/15 days \nand an increased incidence of testicular Leydig cell tumours in males. In a two-year mouse \noncogenicity study (daily oral administration) there was an increased incidence of ovarian sex cord \nstromal tumours (both benign and malignant) at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. At the no-effect \nlevel for these findings, systemic exposure levels (AUC) were, in rats, approximately 1.5–fold the \nexpected human exposure levels in females and 0.8-fold in males, and in mice, approximately 0.8-fold \nthe expected human exposure levels in both males and females. Induction of such tumours is \nconsistent with pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by \nantiestrogens in cycling animals. Therefore, these findings are not considered to be relevant to the use \nof fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.\n\nEnvironmental risk assessment (ERA)\nEnvironmental risk assessment studies have shown that fulvestrant may have potential to cause \nadverse effects to the aquatic environment (see section 6.6).\n\n6.

What Faslodex is and what it is used for\n\nFaslodex contains the active substance fulvestrant, which belongs to the group of estrogen blockers. \nEstrogens, a type of female sex hormones, can in some cases be involved in the growth of breast \ncancer.\n\nFaslodex is used either: \n alone, to treat postmenopausal women with a type of breast cancer called estrogen receptor \n\npositive breast cancer that is locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body \n(metastatic), or\n\n in combination with palbociclib to treat women with a type of breast cancer called hormone \nreceptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, that is\nlocally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Women who have not \nreached menopause will also be treated with a medicine called a luteinizing hormone releasing \nhormone (LHRH) agonist.\n\nWhen Faslodex is given in combination with palbociclib, it is important that you also read the package \nleaflet for palbociclib. If you have any questions about palbociclib, please ask your doctor.\n\n2. What you need to know before you use Faslodex\n\nDo not use Faslodex:\n- if you are allergic to fulvestrant or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6)\n- if you are pregnant or breast-feeding\n- if you have severe liver problems\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse before using Faslodex if any of these apply to you:\n- kidney or liver problems\n- low numbers of platelets (which help blood clotting) or bleeding disorders \n\n\n\n32\n\n- previous problems with blood clots\n- osteoporosis (loss of bone density)\n- alcoholism\n\nChildren and adolescents\nFaslodex is not indicated in children and adolescents under 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and Faslodex\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.\nIn particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using anticoagulants (medicines to prevent blood \nclots).\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nYou must not use Faslodex if you are pregnant. If you can become pregnant, you should use effective \ncontraception while you are being treated with Faslodex and for 2 years after your last dose.\n\nYou must not breast-feed while on treatment with Faslodex.\n\nDriving and using machines\nFaslodex is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, if you feel tired after \ntreatment do not drive or use machines.\n\nFaslodex contains 10% w/v ethanol (alcohol), i.e. up to 500 mg per injection, equivalent to 10 ml \nbeer or 4 ml wine.\nHarmful for those suffering from alcoholism.\nTo be taken into account in high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy.\n\nFaslodex contains 500 mg benzyl alcohol per injection, equivalent to 100 mg/ml.\nBenzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.\n\nFaslodex contains 750 mg benzyl benzoate per injection, equivalent to 150 mg/ml.\n\n3. How to use Faslodex\n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure.\n\nThe recommended dose is 500 mg fulvestrant (two 250 mg/5 ml injections) given once a month, with \nan additional 500 mg dose given 2 weeks after the initial dose.\n\nYour doctor or nurse will give you Faslodex as a slow intramuscular injection, one into each of your \nbuttocks.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.\n\nYou may need immediate medical treatment if you experience any of the following side effects:\n\n Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, including swelling of the face, lips, tongue and/or throat\nthat may be signs of anaphylactic reactions\n\n\n\n33\n\n Thromboembolism (increased risk of blood clots)*\n Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n Liver failure\n\nTell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you notice any of the following side effects:\n\nVery common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)\n Injection site reactions, such as pain and/or inflammation\n Abnormal levels of liver enzymes (in blood tests)*\n Nausea (feeling sick)\n Weakness, tiredness*\n Joint and musculoskeletal pain\n Hot flushes\n Skin rash\n Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, including swelling of the face, lips, tongue and/or throat\n\nAll other side effects:\n\nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)\n Headache\n Vomiting, diarrhoea, or loss of appetite*\n Urinary tract infections\n Back pain*\n Increase of bilirubin (bile pigment produced by the liver)\n Thromboembolism (increased risk of blood clots)*\n Decreased levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia)\n Vaginal bleeding\n Lower back pain irradiating to leg on one side (sciatica)\n Sudden weakness, numbness, tingling, or loss of movement in your leg, especially on only one\n\nside of your body, sudden problems with walking or balance (peripheral neuropathy)\n\nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people)\n Thick, whitish vaginal discharge and candidiasis (infection)\n Bruising and bleeding at the site of injection\n Increase of gamma-GT, a liver enzyme seen in a blood test\n Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n Liver failure\n Numbness, tingling and pain\n Anaphylactic reactions\n\n* Includes side effects for which the exact role of Faslodex cannot be assessed due to the underlying \ndisease.\n\nReporting of side effects\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V.
