NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\n \n\nIKERVIS 1 mg/mL eye drops, emulsion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\n \n\nOne mL of emulsion contains 1 mg of ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect: \n\nOne mL of emulsion contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n\n \n\nEye drops, emulsion. \n\nMilky white emulsion. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indication \n\n \n\nTreatment of severe keratitis in adult patients with dry eye disease, which has not improved despite \n\ntreatment with tear substitutes (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nTreatment must be initiated by an ophthalmologist or a healthcare professional qualified in \n\nophthalmology. \n\n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop once daily to be applied to the affected eye(s) at bedtime. \n\nResponse to treatment should be reassessed at least every 6 months. \n\n \n\nIf a dose is missed, treatment should be continued on the next day as normal. Patients should be \n\nadvised not to instil more than one drop in the affected eye(s). \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nElderly patients \n\nThe elderly population has been studied in clinical studies. No dose adjustment is required. \n\n \n\nPatients with renal or hepatic impairment \n\nThe effect of ciclosporin has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, \n\nno special considerations are needed in these populations. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of ciclosporin in children and adolescents aged below 18 in the treatment of \n\nsevere keratitis in patients with dry eye disease, which has not improved despite treatment with tear \n\nsubstitutes. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nOcular use. \n\n \n\nPrecautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product \n\nPatients should be instructed to first wash their hands. \n\nPrior to administration, the single-dose container should be gently shaken. \n\n \n\nFor single use only. Each single-dose container is sufficient to treat both eyes. Any unused emulsion \n\nshould be discarded immediately. \n\n \n\nPatients should be instructed to use nasolacrimal occlusion and to close the eyelids for 2 minutes after \n\ninstillation, to reduce the systemic absorption. This may result in a decrease in systemic undesirable \n\neffects and an increase in local activity.  \n\n \n\nIf more than one topical ophthalmic medicinal product is being used, the medicinal products must be \n\nadministered at least 15 minutes apart. IKERVIS should be administered last (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nOcular or peri-ocular malignancies or premalignant conditions. \n\nActive or suspected ocular or peri-ocular infection. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nIKERVIS has not been studied in patients with a history of ocular herpes and should therefore be used \n\nwith caution in such patients. \n\n \n\nContact lenses \n\nPatients wearing contact lenses have not been studied. Careful monitoring of patients with severe \n\nkeratitis is recommended. Contact lenses should be removed before instillation of the eye drops at \n\nbedtime and may be reinserted at wake-up time. \n\n \n\nConcomitant therapy \n\nThere is limited experience with ciclosporin in the treatment of patients with glaucoma. Regular \n\nclinical monitoring should be exercised when treating these patients concomitantly with IKERVIS, \n\nespecially with beta-blockers which are known to decrease tear secretion. \n\n \n\nEffects on the immune system \n\nOphthalmic medicinal products, which affect the immune system, including ciclosporin, may affect \n\nhost defences against local infections and malignancies. Therefore, regular examination of the eye(s) is \n\nrecommended, e.g. at least every 6 months, when IKERVIS is used for years. \n\n \n\nCetalkonium chloride content \n\nIKERVIS contains cetalkonium chloride. Contact lenses should be removed prior to application and \n\nmay be reinserted at wake-up time. Cetalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation. Patients should be \n\nmonitored in case of prolonged use. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed with IKERVIS. \n\n \n\nCombination with other medicinal products that affect the immune system \n\n \n\nCo-administration of IKERVIS with eye drops containing corticosteroids could potentiate the effects \n\nof ciclosporin on the immune system (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \n\n \n\nIKERVIS is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\n \n\nThere is no data from the use of IKERVIS in pregnant women.  \n\n \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration of ciclosporin \n\nat exposure considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little \n\nrelevance to the clinical use of IKERVIS. \n\n \n\nIKERVIS is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs \n\nthe potential risk to the foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nFollowing oral administration, ciclosporin is excreted in breast milk. There is insufficient information \n\non the effects of ciclosporin in newborns/infants. However, at therapeutic doses of ciclosporin in eye \n\ndrops, it is unlikely that sufficient amounts would be present in breast milk. A decision must be made \n\nwhether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from IKERVIS therapy taking into \n\naccount the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nThere is no data on the effects of IKERVIS on human fertility.  \n\nNo impairment of fertility has been reported in animals receiving intravenous ciclosporin (see \n\nsection 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nIKERVIS has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product may induce temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances which may \n\naffect the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or \n\nuse machines until their vision has cleared. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions are eye pain (19.0%), eye irritation (17.5%), ocular hyperaemia \n\n(5.5%), lacrimation increased (4.9%) and eyelid erythema (1.7%) which are usually transitory and \n\noccurred during instillation.These adverse reactions are consistent with those that have been reported \n\nduring post-marketing experience. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions listed below were observed in clinical studies or during post-\n\nmarketing experience. They are ranked according to system organ class and classified according to the \n\nfollowing convention: very common (1/10), common (1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (1/1,000 to \n<1/100), rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from \nthe available data). \n\n \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \n\nInfections and \n\ninfestations \n\nUncommon Keratitis bacterial, \n\nHerpes zoster ophthalmic. \n\nEye disorders Very \n\ncommon \n\nEye pain, \n\nEye irritation \n\nCommon Erythema of eyelid, \n\nLacrimation increased, \n\nOcular hyperaemia, \n\nVision blurred, \n\nEyelid oedema, \n\nConjunctival hyperaemia, \n\nEye pruritus \n\nUncommon Conjunctival oedema, \n\nLacrimal disorder, \n\nEye discharge, \n\nConjunctival irritation, \n\nConjunctivitis, \n\nForeign body sensation in eyes, \n\nDeposit eye, \n\nKeratitis, \n\nBlepharitis, \n\nChalazion, \n\nCorneal infiltrates, \n\nCorneal scar, \n\nEyelid pruritus, \n\nIridocyclitis. \n\nOcular discomfort \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nUncommon Instillation site reaction \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nUncommon Headache \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nEye pain \n\nA frequently reported local adverse reaction associated with the use of IKERVIS during clinical trials. \n\nIt is likely to be attributable to ciclosporin. \n\n \n\nGeneralised and localised infections \n\nPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapies, including ciclosporin, are at increased risk of \n\ninfections. Both generalised and localised infections can occur. Pre-existing infections may also be \n\naggravated (see section 4.3). Cases of infections have been reported uncommonly in association with \n\nthe use of IKERVIS. \n\nAs precautionary measure, action should be taken to reduce the systemic absorption (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nA topical overdose is not likely to occur after ocular administration. If overdose with IKERVIS occurs, \n\ntreatment should be symptomatic and supportive. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, other ophthalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA18. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nCiclosporin (also known as ciclosporin A) is a cyclic polypeptide immunomodulator with \n\nimmunosuppressant properties. It has been shown to prolong survival of allogeneic transplants in \n\nanimals and significantly improved graft survival in all types of solid organ transplantation in man. \n\nCiclosporin has also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Studies in animals suggest that \n\nciclosporin inhibits the development of cell-mediated reactions. Ciclosporin has been shown to inhibit \n\nthe production and/or release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2) or T-cell \n\ngrowth factor (TCGF). It is also known to up-regulate the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. \n\nCiclosporin appears to block the resting lymphocytes in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle. All \n\navailable evidence suggests that ciclosporin acts specifically and reversibly on lymphocytes and does \n\nnot depress haematopoiesis or has any effect on the function of phagocytic cells. \n\nIn patients with dry eye disease, a condition that may be considered to have an inflammatory \n\nimmunological mechanism, following ocular administration, ciclosporin is passively absorbed into T-\n\nlymphocyte infiltrates in the cornea and conjunctiva and inactivates calcineurin phosphatase. \n\nCiclosporin-induced inactivation of calcineurin inhibits the dephosphorylation of the transcription \n\nfactor NF-AT and prevents NF-AT translocation into the nucleus, thus blocking the release of pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokines such as IL-2. \n\n \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\n \n\nThe efficacy and safety of IKERVIS were evaluated in two randomised, double-masked, vehicle-\n\ncontrolled clinical studies in adult patients with dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) who met \n\nthe International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) criteria. \n\n \n\nIn the 12 month, double-masked, vehicle controlled, pivotal clinical trial (SANSIKA study), 246 Dry \n\nEye Disease (DED) patients with severe keratitis (defined as a corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) \n\nscore of 4 on the modified Oxford scale) were randomised to one drop of IKERVIS or vehicle daily at \n\nbedtime for 6 months. Patients randomised to the vehicle group were switched to IKERVIS after \n\n6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving by month 6 at least a two-\n\ngrade improvement in keratitis (CFS) and a 30% improvement in symptoms, measured with the \n\nOcular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). The proportion of responders in the IKERVIS group was \n\n28.6%, compared to 23.1% in the vehicle group. The difference was not statistically significant \n\n(p=0.326). \n\nThe severity of keratitis, assessed using CFS, improved significantly from baseline at month 6 with \n\nIKERVIS compared to vehicle (mean change from baseline was -1.764 with IKERVIS vs. -1.418 with \n\nvehicle, p=0.037). The proportion of IKERVIS-treated patients with a 3-grade improvement in CFS \n\nscore at month 6 (from 4 to 1) was 28.8%, compared to 9.6% of vehicle-treated subjects, but this was a \n\npost-hoc analysis, which limits the robustness of this outcome. The beneficial effect on keratitis was \n\nmaintained in the open phase of the study, from month  6 and up to month 12. \n\nThe mean change from baseline in the 100-point OSDI score was -13.6 with IKERVIS and -14.1 with \n\nvehicle at month 6 (p=0.858). In addition, no improvement was observed for IKERVIS compared to \n\nvehicle at month 6 for other secondary endpoints, including ocular discomfort score, Schirmer test, use \n\nof concomitant artificial tears, investigator’s global evaluation of efficacy, tear break-up time, \nlissamine green staining, quality of life score, and tear osmolarity. \n\nA reduction in the ocular surface inflammation assessed with Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-\n\nDR) expression (an exploratory endpoint), was observed at month 6 in favour of IKERVIS (p=0.021). \n\n \n\nIn the 6 month, double-masked, vehicle controlled, supportive clinical trial (SICCANOVE study), \n\n492 DED patients with moderate to severe keratitis (defined as a CFS score of 2 to 4) were also \n\nrandomised to IKERVIS or vehicle daily at bedtime for 6 months. The co-primary endpoints were the \n\nchange in CFS score, and the change in global score of ocular discomfort unrelated to study \n\nmedication instillation, both measured at month 6. A small but statistically significant difference in \n\nCFS improvement was observed between the treatment groups at month 6 in favour of IKERVIS \n\n(mean change from baseline in CFS -1.05 with IKERVIS and -0.82 with vehicle, p=0.009).  \n\nThe mean change from baseline in ocular discomfort score (assessed using a Visual Analogic Scale) \n\nwas -12.82 with IKERVIS and -11.21 with vehicle (p=0.808). \n\n \n\nIn both studies, no significant improvement of symptoms was observed for IKERVIS compared to \n\nvehicle after 6 months of treatment, whether using a visual analogue scale or the OSDI.  \n\n \n\nIn both studies one third of the patients in average had Sjögren’s syndrome; as for the overall \npopulation, a statistically significant improvement in CFS in favour of IKERVIS was observed in this \n\nsubgroup of patients. \n\n \n\nAt completion of the SANSIKA study (12 month study), patients were asked to enter the Post \n\nSANSIKA study. This study was an open-label, non-randomised, one-arm, 24-month study extension \n\nof the Sansika Study. In Post SANSIKA study patients alternatively received IKERVIS treatment or \n\nno treatment depending on CFS score (patients received IKERVIS when there was a worsening of \n\nkeratitis). \n\nThis study was designed to monitor the long-term efficacy and relapse rates in patients who have \n\npreviously received IKERVIS. \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe primary objective of the study was to assess the duration of the improvement following IKERVIS \n\ntreatment discontinuation once the patient was improved with respect to the baseline of the SANSIKA \n\nstudy (i.e. at least 2 grade improvement on the modified Oxford scale). \n\n67 patients were enrolled (37.9% of the 177 patients having ended Sansika). After the 24-month \n\nperiod, 61.3% of 62 patients included in the primary efficacy population did not experience a relapse \n\nbased on CFS scores. Percentage of patients who experienced a severe keratitis recurrence was 35% \n\nand 48% in patients treated 12 months and 6 months with IKERVIS respectively in the SANSIKA \n\nstudy. \n\nBased on the first quartile (the median could not be estimated due to the small number of relapses), \n\ntime to relapse (back to CFS grade 4) was ≤224 days and ≤175 days in patients previously treated \n12 months and 6 months with IKERVIS, respectively. Patients spent more time on CFS grade 2 \n\n(Median 12.7 weeks/year) and grade 1 (Median 6.6 weeks/year) than CFS grade 3 (Median 2.4 \n\nweeks/year), CFS grades 4 and 5 (Median time 0 week/year).  \n\nAssessment of DED symptoms by VAS showed a worsening of patient’s discomfort from the time \ntreatment was first stopped to the time it was restarted except pain which remained relatively low and \n\nstable. The median global VAS score increased from the time treatment was first stopped (23.3%) to \n\nthe time treatment was restarted (45.1%). \n\nNo significant changes have been observed in the other secondary endpoints (TBUT, lissamine green \n\nstaining and Schirmer test, NEI-VFQ and EQ-5D) over the course of the extension study. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nIKERVIS in all subsets of the paediatric population in dry eye disease (see section 4.2 for information \n\non paediatric use). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in humans with IKERVIS. \n\n \n\nBlood concentrations of IKERVIS were measured using a specific high-pressure liquid \n\nchromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In 374 patients from the two efficacy studies, plasma \n\nconcentrations of ciclosporin were measured before administration and after 6 months (SICCANOVE \n\nstudy and SANSIKA study) and 12 months of treatment (SANSIKA study). After 6 months of ocular \n\ninstillation of IKERVIS once per day, 327 patients had values below the lower limit of detection \n\n(0.050 ng/mL) and 35 patients were below the lower limit of quantification (0.100 ng/mL). \n\nMeasurable values not exceeding 0.206 ng/mL were measured in eight patients, values considered to \n\nbe negligible. Three patients had values above the upper limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) however \n\nthey were already taking oral ciclosporin at a stable dose, which was allowed by the studies’ protocol. \nAfter 12 months of treatment, values were below the low limit of detection for 56 patients and below \n\nthe low limit of quantification in 19 patients. Seven patients had measurable values (from 0.105 to \n\n1.27 ng/mL), all considered to be negligible values. Two patients had values above the upper limit of \n\nquantification, however they were also on oral ciclosporin at a stable dose since their inclusion in the \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \n\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, phototoxicity and photoallergy, genotoxicity, carcinogenic \n\npotential, toxicity to reproduction and development. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nEffects in non-clinical studies were observed only with systemic administration or at exposures \n\nconsidered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to \n\nclinical use. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

What you need to know before you use IKERVIS \n\n3. How to use IKERVIS \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How to store IKERVIS \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What IKERVIS is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nIKERVIS contains the active substance, ciclosporin. Ciclosporin belongs to a group of medicines \n\nknown as immunosuppressive agents that are used to reduce inflammation. \n\n \n\nIKERVIS is used to treat adults with severe keratitis (inflammation of the cornea, the transparent layer \n\nin the front part of the eye). It is used in those patients who have dry eye disease, which has not \n\nimproved despite treatment with tear substitutes (artificial tears). \n\n \n\nTalk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse. \n\n \n\nYou should visit your doctor at least every 6 months to assess the effect of IKERVIS. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use IKERVIS \n\n \n\nDo NOT use IKERVIS \n\n- if you are allergic to ciclosporin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\n- if you have had or have a cancer in or around your eye. \n\n- if you have an eye infection. \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nOnly use IKERVIS for dropping in your eye(s). \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using IKERVIS \n\n- if you have previously had an eye infection by the herpes virus that might have damaged the \n\ntransparent front part of the eye (cornea). \n\n- if you are taking any medicines containing steroids. \n\n- if you are taking any medicines to treat glaucoma. \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nContact lenses can further damage the transparent front part of the eye (cornea). Therefore, you should \n\nremove your contact lenses at bedtime before using IKERVIS; you can reinsert them when you wake \n\nup. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nIKERVIS should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years old. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and IKERVIS \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor if you are using eye drops containing steroids with IKERVIS as these might \n\nincrease the risk of side effects. \n\n \n\nIKERVIS eye drops should be used at least 15 minutes after any other eye drops are used. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nIKERVIS should not be used if you are pregnant. \n\n \n\nIf you could become pregnant you must use contraception while using this medicine. \n\n \n\nIKERVIS is likely to be present in breast milk in very small amounts. If you are breast feeding talk to \n\nyour doctor before using this medicine. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYour vision may be blurred immediately after using IKERVIS eye drops. If this happens, wait until \n\nyour vision clears before you drive or use machines. \n\n \n\nIKERVIS contains cetalkonium chloride \n\nThis medicine contains 0.05 mg cetalkonium chloride in 1 mL. You should remove contact lenses \n\nbefore using this medicine and you can reinsert them when you wake up. Cetalkonium chloride may \n\ncause eye irritation. If you feel abnormal eye sensation, stinging or pain in the eye after using this \n\nmedicine, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use IKERVIS \n\n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is one drop in each affected eye, once daily at bedtime. \n\n \n\nInstructions for use \n\nFollow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if there is anything you do not \n\nunderstand. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n    \n\n 1 2 3 \n\n \n\n Wash your hands. \n If you wear contact lenses, take them out at bedtime before using the drops; you can reinsert \n\nthem when you wake up. \n\n Open the aluminium pouch, which contains 5 single-dose containers. \n Take one single-dose container from the aluminium pouch. \n Gently shake the single dose container prior to use. \n Twist off the cap (picture 1). \n Pull down your lower eyelid (picture 2). \n Tilt your head back and look up at the ceiling. \n Gently squeeze one drop of the medicine onto your eye. Make sure you do not touch your eye \n\nwith the tip of the single-dose container. \n\n Blink a few times so that the medicine covers your eye. \n After using IKERVIS, press a finger into the corner of your eye by the nose and close gently \n\nthe eyelids for 2 minutes (picture 3). This helps to stop IKERVIS getting into the rest of the \n\nbody. \n\n If you use drops in both eyes, repeat the steps for your other eye. \n Discard the single dose container as soon as you have used it, even if there is still some liquid \n\nleft in it. \n\n The remaining single-dose containers should be kept in the aluminium pouch. \n \n\nIf a drop misses your eye, try again. \n\n \n\nIf you use more IKERVIS than you should, rinse your eye with water. Do not put in any more drops \n\nuntil it is time for your next regular dose. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use IKERVIS, continue with the next dose as planned. Do not use a double dose to \n\nmake up for the forgotten dose. Do not use more than one drop each day in the affected eye(s). \n\n \n\nIf you stop using IKERVIS without speaking to your doctor, the inflammation of the transparent \n\nfront part of your eye (known as keratitis) will not be controlled and could lead to impaired vision. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\nThe following side effects have been reported: \n\n \n\nThe most common side effects are in and around the eyes. \n\n \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n\n- Eye pain, \n\n\n\n23 \n\n- Eye irritation \n\n \n\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n- Redness of the eyelid, \n\n- Watery eyes, \n\n- Eye redness, \n\n- Blurred vision, \n\n- Swelling of the eyelid, \n\n- Redness of the conjunctiva (thin membrane covering the front part of the eye), \n\n- Itching in the eye \n\n \n\nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n- Discomfort in or around the eye when the drops are put into the eye, including feeling that there \n\nis something in the eye, \n\n- Irritation or swelling of the conjunctiva (thin membrane covering the front part of the eye), \n\n- Tear disorder, \n\n- Eye discharge, \n\n- Irritation or inflammation of the conjunctiva (thin membrane covering the front part of the eye), \n\n- Inflammation of the iris (coloured part of the eye) or eyelid, \n\n- Deposits in the eye, \n\n- Abrasion to the outer layer of the cornea, \n\n- Red or swollen eyelids, \n\n- Cyst in the eyelid, \n\n- Immune response or scarring in the cornea, \n\n- Itching in the eyelid, \n\n- Bacterial infection or inflammation of the cornea (transparent front part of the eye), \n\n- Painful rash around the eye caused by the herpes zoster virus, \n\n- Headache \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
