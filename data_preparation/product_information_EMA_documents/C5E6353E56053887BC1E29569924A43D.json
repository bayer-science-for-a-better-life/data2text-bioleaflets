This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFulphila 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 6 mg of pegfilgrastim* in 0.6 mL solution for injection. The \nconcentration is 10 mg/mL based on protein only**.  \n \n*Produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology followed by conjugation with \npolyethylene glycol (PEG).  \n** The concentration is 20 mg/mL if the PEG moiety is included. \n \nThe potency of this product should not be compared to the potency of another pegylated or \nnon-pegylated protein of the same therapeutic class. For more information, see section 5.1  \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 mg sorbitol (E420). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection).  \n \nClear, colourless solution for injection. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nReduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients \ntreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia \nand myelodysplastic syndromes). \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPegfilgrastim therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or \nhaematology.  \n \nPosology \n \nOne 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of pegfilgrastim is recommended for each chemotherapy \ncycle, given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \n\nNo dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end stage \nrenal disease. \n \nPaediatric population  \n\nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in children has not yet been established. Currently available \ndata are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.  \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFulphila is injected subcutaneously. The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or upper \narm.  \n \nFor instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nPatients with myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes \n \nLimited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for \npegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (see section 5.1). \nHowever, the long-term effects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in AML; therefore, it \nshould be used with caution in this patient population.  \n \nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects \nmay be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic \nsyndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary Acute Myeloid Leukaemia \n(AML); therefore, it should not be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish \nthe diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with \ncytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established.  \n \nGeneral \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose \nchemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy beyond established dose regimens.  \n \nPulmonary adverse events  \n \nPulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF \nadministration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher \nrisk (see section 4.8).  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nThe onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological \nsigns of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil \ncount may be preliminary signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In such \ncircumstances pegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the \nappropriate treatment given (see section 4.8). \n \nGlomerulonephritis  \n \nGlomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, \nevents of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and \npegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. \n \nCapillary leak syndrome  \n \nCapillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration \nand is characterised by hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients \nwho develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard \nsymptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8).  \n \nSplenomegaly and splenic rupture  \n \nGenerally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal \ncases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, \nspleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of \nsplenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip \npain.  \n \nThrombocytopenia and anaemia  \n \nTreatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full \ndose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of \nplatelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering \nsingle or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia.  \n \nSickle cell anaemia  \n \nSickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or \nsickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing \npegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical \nparameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicinal product \nwith splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis.  \n \nLeukocytosis  \n \nWhite blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 x 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 1 % of \npatients receiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis \nhave been reported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after \nadministration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicinal product. \nConsistent with the clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be \nperformed at regular intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/l after the expected \nnadir, this medicinal product should be discontinued immediately.  \n \nHypersensitivity  \n \nHypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have \nbeen reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Permanently discontinue pegfilgrastim in patients \n\n\n\n5 \n\nwith clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer pegfilgrastim to patients with a history \nof hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate \ntherapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome \n \nStevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in \nassociation with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of \npegfilgrastim, treatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time.  \n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.  \nRates of generation of antibodies against pegfilgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies \ndo occur as expected with all biologics; however, they have not been associated with \nneutralising activity at present. \n \nAortitis \n \nAortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The \nsymptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory \nmarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by \nCT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. \n \nOther warnings \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or \nhealthy donors has not been adequately evaluated. \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient positive bone imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting \nbone-imaging results.  \n \nThis medicinal product contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filed syringe which is equivalent to \n50 mg / mL. The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or \nfructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 6 mg dose, that is to say \nessentially ‘sodium-free’.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nDue to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ \npegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. \nIn clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. \nConcomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In \nanimal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other \nantimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression.  \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been \nspecifically investigated in clinical trials.  \n \nThe potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been \nspecifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy \nassociated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas.  \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nSpecific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not \nindicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pegfilgrastim is not recommended during \npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nThere is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim / metabolites in human milk, a risk \nto the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fulphila therapy taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.  \n \nFertility  \n \nPegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative \nweekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body \nsurface area) (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nPegfilgrastim has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [≥ 1/10]) and \nmusculoskeletal pain (common [≥ 1/100 to < 1/10]). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate \nseverity, transient and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics.  \n \nHypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythema, \nflushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon \n[≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100]). Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients \nreceiving pegfilgrastim (uncommon) (see section 4.4).  \n \nCapillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as \nuncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following \nadministration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors; see section 4.4 and section “Description of \nselected adverse reactions” below.  \n \nSplenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon.  \n \nSplenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of \npegfilgrastim (see section 4.4).  \n \nUncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, \npulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in \nrespiratory failure or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nIsolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell \ndisease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4).  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe data in the table below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting.

The frequency category was estimated from a statistical \ncalculation based upon 1,576 patients receiving pegfilgrastim in nine randomised clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nUncommon cases of Sweet’s syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying \nhaematological malignancies may play a role.  \n \nUncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. \nThe mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown.  \n  \nInjection site reactions, including injection site erythema (uncommon) as well as injection site pain \n(common) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim.  \n \nCommon cases of leukocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] > 100 x 109/l) have been reported (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nReversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated \nclinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, \nwith no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy.  \n \nNausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy.  \n \nUncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST \n(aspartate aminotransferase), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following \ncytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline.  \n \nCommon cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported.  \n \nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post marketing setting with granulocyte \ncolony-stimulating factor use. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant \ndiseases, sepsis, taking multiple chemotherapy medicinal products or undergoing apheresis (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe experience in children and adolescents is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions \nin younger children aged 0-5 years (92 %) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 \nand 12-21 years respectively (80 % and 67 %) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported \nwas bone pain (see section 5.1 and 5.2).  \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSingle doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy \nvolunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse \nevents were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code: L03AA13  \n \nFulphila is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nHuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the \nproduction and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of \nrecombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule.  \nPegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal clearance. Pegfilgrastim \nand filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a marked increase in \nperipheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes and/or \nlymphocytes. Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to pegfilgrastim show normal \nor enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function. As with other \nhaematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial \ncells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, including malignant cells, in vitro and similar \neffects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. \n \nIn two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high risk stage II-IV breast cancer \nundergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of \npegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of \nfebrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of \n11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to \nresult in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to7 days, and a 30-40 % incidence of febrile \nneutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration \nof grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the \nfilgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95 % CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile \nneutropenia was 13 % of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20 % of filgrastim-treated \npatients (difference 7 %, 95 % CI of -19 %, 5 %). In a second study (n = 310), which used a \nweight-adjusted dose (100 mcg /kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim \ngroup was 1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95 % \nCI -0.36, 0.30). The overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9 % of patients treated with pegfilgrastim \nand 18 % of patients treated with filgrastim (difference 9 %, 95 % CI of -16.8 %,-1.1 %). \n \nIn a placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on \nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy \nregimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20 % (docetaxel 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of \npegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The \nincidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared \nwith placebo (1 % versus 17 %, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use \nassociated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group \ncompared with placebo (1 % versus 14 %, p < 0.001; and 2 % versus 10 %, p < 0.001).  \n \nA small (n = 83), Phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de \nnovo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n11 \n\nadministered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was \nestimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4).  \n \nIn a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients \nreceiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils \n< 0.5 x 109) was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (8.9 days) compared to older children \naged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher \nincidence of febrile neutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (75 %) compared to \nolder children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (70 % and 33 %, respectively) and adults (see sections \n4.8 and 5.2). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAfter a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim \noccurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained \nduring the period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of \npegfilgrastim is non-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with \nincreasing dose. Pegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, \nwhich becomes saturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the \nserum concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see \nfigure 1).  \n \nFigure 1. Profile of median pegfilgrastim serum concentration and Absolute Neutrophil Count \n(ANC) in chemotherapy treated patients after a single 6 mg injection \n \n\n \n \nDue to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not \nexpected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open label, single dose study (n = 31) \nvarious stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the \npharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nElderly \n \nLimited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is \nsimilar to that in adults.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who \nreceived 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest \nage group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (Area Under Curve (AUC)) (± \nStandard Deviation) (47.9 ± 22.5 mcg·hr/mL) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years \n(22.0 ± 13.1 mcg·hr/mL and 29.3 ± 23.2 mcg·hr/mL, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the \nexception of the youngest age group (0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar \nto that for adult patients with high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 mcg/kg \npegfilgrastim after the completion of doxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected \npharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, \nextramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement.  \n \nThere were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim \nsubcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo \nloss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen \nwhen pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that \npegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, \noestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by \npegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n25 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nFulphila 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \npegfilgrastim \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Fulphila is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use Fulphila \n3. How to use Fulphila  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Fulphila \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fulphila is and what it is used for \n \nFulphila contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body.  \n \nFulphila is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are \nimportant as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells \nfall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \nincreased risk of infection.  \n \nYour doctor has given you Fulphila to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.  \n \nFulphila is for use in adults aged 18 and over. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fulphila \n \nDo not use Fulphila   \n- if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).  \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fulphila:  \n- if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \n\nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the \nskin that itch. \n\n- experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS).  \n\n- if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:  \n• swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, \n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling \nof tiredness.  \n\nThese could be symptoms of condition called “Capillary Leak Syndrome” which causes blood to leak \nfrom the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4.  \n- if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder.

It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \nfor assistance.  \n \nHow do you, or the person injecting you, use Fulphila pre-filled syringe?  \nYou will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \nEquipment that you need  \nTo give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:  \n- a pre-filled syringe of Fulphila; and  \n- alcohol wipes or similar.  \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Fulphila?  \n \n1. Remove the syringe from the refrigerator.  \n \n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe.  \n \n3. Do not remove the needle cap from the syringe until you are ready to inject.  \n \n4. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed the \nlast day of the month shown.  \n \n5. Check the appearance of Fulphila. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles in it, \nyou must not use it.  \n \n6. For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room \ntemperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm the \nsyringe in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).  \n \n7. Wash your hands thoroughly.  \n \n8. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. \n \nHow do I prepare my Fulphila injection?  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n2. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not have to remove the air \nbubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless.  \n \n3. You can now use the pre-filled syringe.  \n \n\nBefore you inject Fulphila you must do the following:  \n \n1. Hold the syringe barrel and gently take the cap from the needle \nwithout twisting. Pull straight as shown in pictures 1 and 2. Do not \ntouch the needle or push the plunger.  \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\nWhere should I give my injection? \n \n\n \n \nThe most suitable places to inject yourself are:  \n• the top of your thighs; and  \n• the abdomen, except for the area around the navel.  \n \nIf someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your \narms. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nHow do I give my injection?  \n \n1. Clean your skin by using an alcohol wipe.  \n \n2. Pinch (without squeezing) the skin using your thumb and forefinger. Insert the needle into the skin.  \n \n3. Push the plunger down with a slow constant pressure. Push the plunger all the way down as far as it \nwill go to inject all the liquid.  \n \n4. After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of your skin.  \n \n5. If you notice a spot of blood at the injection site dab with a cotton ball or tissues. Do not rub the \ninjection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster.  \n \n6. Do not use any Fulphila that is left in the syringe.  \n \nRemember  \n \nOnly use each syringe for one injection. If you have any problems, please ask your doctor or nurse for \nhelp and advice.  \n \nDisposing of used syringes \n  \n\n• Do not put the cap back on used needles.  \n• Keep used syringes out of the sight and reach of children. \n• The used syringe should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Ask your \n\npharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to \nprotect the environment.  \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nFulphila 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \npegfilgrastim \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring.

What you need to know before you use Fulphila \n3. How to use Fulphila  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Fulphila \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Fulphila is and what it is used for \n \nFulphila contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by \nbiotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very \nsimilar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body.  \n \nFulphila is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence \nof febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of \ncytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are \nimportant as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of \nchemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells \nfall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an \nincreased risk of infection.  \n \nYour doctor has given you Fulphila to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes \nblood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection.  \n \nFulphila is for use in adults aged 18 and over. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fulphila \n \nDo not use Fulphila  \n- if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6).  \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fulphila:  \n- if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty \n\nbreathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the skin \nthat itch. \n\n- experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS).  \n\n- if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects:  \n• swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, \n\ndifficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general \nfeeling of tiredness.  \n\nThese could be symptoms of condition called “Capillary Leak Syndrome” which causes blood to \nleak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4.  \n\n- if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a \nproblem with your spleen (splenomegaly).  \n\n- if you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary \noedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung \ninfiltration).  \n\n- if you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) or \ndecreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot \n(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely.  \n\n- if you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely.  \n- if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the face, \n\nlips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing, these \ncould be signs of a severe allergic reaction.  \n\n- Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the \nbody) has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. The symptoms can include \nfever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor \nif you experience these symptoms. \n\n \nYour doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Fulphila can harm the tiny filters inside your \nkidneys (glomerulonephritis).  \n \nSevere skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of pegfilgrastim. \nStop using Fulphila and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms \ndescribed in section 4. \n \nYou should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood.
