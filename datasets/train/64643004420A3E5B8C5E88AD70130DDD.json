This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See \nsection 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.\n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nViekirax 12.5 mg/75 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach film-coated tablet contains 12.5 mg of ombitasvir, 75 mg of paritaprevir and 50 mg of ritonavir.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet).\n\nPink, oblong, biconvex, film-coated tablets of dimensions 18.8 mm x 10.0 mm, debossed on one side with \n\u2018AV1\u2019.\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nViekirax is indicated in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C \n(CHC) in adults (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).\n\nFor hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype specific activity, see sections 4.4 and 5.1.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nTreatment with Viekirax should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management \nof chronic hepatitis C.\n\nPosology\n\nThe recommended oral dose of Viekirax is two 12.5 mg / 75 mg / 50 mg tablets once daily with food.\n\nViekirax should be used in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of HCV (see \nTable 1).\n\n\n\n3\n\nTable 1. Recommended co-administered medicinal product(s) and treatment duration for Viekirax\nby patient population\n\nPatient population Treatment* Duration\n\nGenotype 1b, without cirrhosis or \nwith compensated cirrhosis\n\nViekirax + dasabuvir\n\n12 weeks \n\n8 weeks may be considered in \npreviously untreated genotype 1b-\ninfected patients with minimal to \n\nmoderate fibrosis** (see section 5.1, \nGARNET study)\n\nGenotype 1a,\nwithout cirrhosis\n\nViekirax + dasabuvir + ribavirin* 12 weeks\n\nGenotype 1a,\nwith compensated cirrhosis\n\nViekirax + dasabuvir + ribavirin* 24 weeks (see section 5.1.)\n\nGenotype 4, without cirrhosis or \nwith compensated cirrhosis\n\nViekirax + ribavirin 12 weeks\n\n*Note: Follow the genotype 1a dosing recommendations in patients with an unknown genotype 1 subtype or \nwith mixed genotype 1 infection. \n** When assessing severity of liver disease using non-invasive methods, a combination of blood biomarkers or \nthe combination of liver stiffness measurement and a blood test improves accuracy and should be undertaken \nprior to 8 week treatment in all patients with moderate fibrosis.\n\nFor specific dosage instructions for dasabuvir and ribavirin, including dose modification, refer to the \nrespective Summaries of Product Characteristics.\n\nMissed doses\nIn case a dose of Viekirax is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 12 hours. If more than 12 \nhours have passed since Viekirax is usually taken, the missed dose should NOT be taken and the patient \nshould take the next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double \ndose.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nHIV-1 Co-infection\nThe dosing recommendations in Table 1 should be followed. For dosing recommendations with HIV \nantiviral medicinal products, refer to sections 4.4 and 4.5. See sections 4.8 and 5.1 for additional \ninformation.\n\nLiver transplant recipients \nViekirax and dasabuvir in combination with ribavirin is recommended for 24 weeks in liver transplant \nrecipients with genotype 1 HCV infection. Viekirax in combination with ribavirin is recommended in\ngenotype 4 infection. Lower ribavirin dose at initiation may be appropriate. In the post-liver transplant \nstudy, ribavirin dosing was individualized and most subjects received 600 to 800 mg per day (see section \n5.1). For dosing recommendations with calcineurin inhibitors see section 4.5. \n\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment of Viekirax is warranted in elderly patients (see section 5.2).\n\nRenal impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Viekirax is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, \nor end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 5.2). For patients that require ribavirin, refer to the \n\n\n\n4\n\nribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics for information regarding use in patients with renal \nimpairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\nNo dose adjustment of Viekirax is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). \nViekirax is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C)\n(see sections 4.3 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Viekirax in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. No \ndata are available.\n\nMethod of administration\n\nThe film-coated tablets are for oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole (i.e. \npatients should not chew, break or dissolve the tablet). To maximise absorption, Viekirax tablets should be \ntaken with food, without regard to fat and calorie content (see section 5.2).\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see section 5.2).\n\nUse of ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral \ncontraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).\n\nMedicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma \nlevels are associated with serious events must not be co-administered with Viekirax (see section 4.5).\nExamples are provided below.\n\nCYP3A4 substrates:\n\n\uf0b7 alfuzosin hydrochloride\n\uf0b7 amiodarone, disopyramide, dronedarone, quinidine, ranolazine\n\uf0b7 astemizole, terfenadine\n\uf0b7 cisapride\n\uf0b7 colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment\n\uf0b7 ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergometrine\n\uf0b7 fusidic acid\n\uf0b7 lomitapide\n\uf0b7 lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin\n\uf0b7 lurasidone\n\uf0b7 oral midazolam, triazolam\n\uf0b7 pimozide\n\uf0b7 quetiapine\n\uf0b7 salmeterol\n\uf0b7 sildenafil (when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension)\n\uf0b7 ticagrelor\n\nCo-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong or \nmoderate enzyme inducers is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plasma \n\n\n\n5\n\nconcentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered (see section 4.5). \nExamples of contraindicated strong or moderate enzyme inducers are provided below. \n\nEnzyme inducers:\n\n\uf0b7 carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital\n\uf0b7 efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine\n\uf0b7 apalutamide,enzalutamide\n\uf0b7 mitotane\n\uf0b7 rifampicin \n\uf0b7 St. John\u2019s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)\n\nCo-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors \nof CYP3A4 is expected to increase paritaprevir plasma concentrations and must not be co-administered \nwith Viekirax (see section 4.5). Examples of contraindicated strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are provided \nbelow.\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:\n\n\uf0b7 cobicistat\n\uf0b7 indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, \n\uf0b7 itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole\n\uf0b7 clarithromycin, telithromycin\n\uf0b7 conivaptan\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nGeneral\n\nViekirax is not recommended for administration as monotherapy and must be used in combination with \nother medicinal products for the treatment of hepatitis C infection (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).\n\nRisk of hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure in patients with cirrhosis\n\nHepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, have been \nreported postmarketing in patients treated with Viekirax with and without dasabuvir and with and without \nribavirin. Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced or decompensated cirrhosis \nprior to initiating therapy. Although causality is difficult to establish due to background advanced liver \ndisease, a potential risk cannot be excluded.\n\nViekirax is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) \n(see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 5.2).\n\nFor patients with cirrhosis:\n\u2022 Monitoring should be performed for clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (such \n\nas ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage).\n\u2022 Hepatic laboratory testing including direct bilirubin levels should be performed at baseline, during \n\nthe first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter.\n\u2022 Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation.\n\n\n\n6\n\nALT elevations\n\nDuring clinical trials with Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin, transient elevations of ALT to \ngreater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 1% of subjects (35 of 3,039). \nALT elevations were asymptomatic and generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, without \nconcomitant elevations of bilirubin, and declined within approximately two weeks of onset with continued \ndosing of Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin. \n\nThese ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in the subgroup of subjects who were using \nethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products such as combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive \nvaginal rings (6 of 25 subjects); (see section 4.3). In contrast, the rate of ALT elevations in subjects using \nother types of oestrogens as typically used in hormonal replacement therapy (i.e., oral and topical \noestradiol and conjugated oestrogens) was similar to the rate observed in subjects who were not using \noestrogen-containing products (approximately 1% in each group). \n\nPatients who are taking ethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal products (i.e. most combined oral \ncontraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings) must switch to an alternative method of contraception (e.g., \nprogestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to initiating Viekirax with or without\ndasabuvir therapy (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nAlthough ALT elevations associated with Viekirax and dasabuvir have been asymptomatic, patients \nshould be instructed to watch for early warning signs of liver inflammation, such as fatigue, weakness, \nlack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, as well as later signs such as jaundice and discoloured faeces, and \nto consult a doctor without delay if such symptoms occur. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes is not \nnecessary in patients that do not have cirrhosis (for cirrhotics, see above). Early discontinuation may result \nin drug resistance, but implications for future therapy are not known.\n\nPregnancy and concomitant use with ribavirin\n\nAlso see section 4.6. \n\nExtreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients \nwhen Viekirax is taken in combination with ribavirin, see section 4.6 and refer to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for ribavirin for additional information.\n\nUse with tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus\n\nCo-administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir with systemic tacrolimus, sirolimus or everolimus increases \nthe concentrations of the immunosuppressant due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir (see section 4.5). \nSerious and/or life threatening events have been observed with co-administration of Viekirax and \ndasabuvir with systemic tacrolimus, and a similar risk can be expected with sirolimus and everolimus.\n\nAvoid concomitant use of tacrolimus or sirolimus with Viekirax and dasabuvir unless the benefits \noutweigh the risks. If tacrolimus or sirolimus are used together with Viekirax and dasabuvir, caution is \nadvised, and recommended doses and monitoring strategies can be found in section 4.5. Everolimus \ncannot be used due to lack of suitable dose strengths for dose adjustments.\n\nTacrolimus or sirolimus whole blood concentrations should be monitored upon initiation and throughout \nco-administration with Viekirax and dasabuvir and the dose and/or dosing frequency should be adjusted as \nneeded. Patients should be monitored frequently for any changes in renal function or tacrolimus or \nsirolimus associated adverse reactions. Refer to the tacrolimus or sirolimus Summary of Product \nCharacteristics for additional dosing and monitoring instructions.\n\n\n\n7\n\nGenotype-specific activity\n\nConcerning recommended regimens with different HCV genotypes, see section 4.2. Concerning \ngenotype- specific virological and clinical activity, see section 5.1.\n\nThe efficacy of Viekirax has not been established in patients with HCV genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6; therefore \nViekirax should not be used to treat patients infected with these genotypes.\n\nCo-administration with other direct-acting antivirals against HCV\n\nViekirax safety and efficacy have been established in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin. Co-\nadministration of Viekirax with other antivirals has not been studied and, therefore, cannot be \nrecommended.\n\nRetreatment\n\nThe efficacy of Viekirax in patients previously exposed to Viekirax, or to medicinal products of the same \nclasses as those of Viekirax (NS3/4A inhibitors or NS5A inhibitors), has not been demonstrated. \nConcerning cross-resistance, see also section 5.1.\n\nUse with glucocorticoids metabolised by CYP3A (e.g. fluticasone)\n\nCaution should be used when administering Viekirax with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are \nmetabolised by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoids metabolised with CYP3A can \nincrease systemic exposures of the glucocorticoids, and cases of Cushing\u2019s syndrome and subsequent \nadrenal suppression have been reported with ritonavir-containing regimens. Concomitant use of Viekirax\nand glucocorticoids, particularly long-term use, should only be initiated if the potential benefit of \ntreatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.5).\n\nUse with colchicine\n\nThe interaction between Viekirax with or without dasabuvir and colchicine has not been evaluated. A \nreduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with \nnormal renal or hepatic function if treatment with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir is required (see \nsection 4.5). In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, use of colchicine with Viekirax with or without \ndasabuvir is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nUse with statins \n\nSimvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).\n\nRosuvastatin\nViekirax with dasabuvir is expected to increase the exposure to rosuvastatin more than 3-fold. If \nrosuvastatin treatment is required during the treatment period, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin \nshould be 5 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2).The increase in rosuvastatin when combined with Viekirax \nwithout dasabuvir is less pronounced. In this combination, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin should \nbe 10 mg (see section 4.5, Table 2).\n\nPitavastatin and fluvastatin\nThe interactions between pitavastatin and fluvastatin and Viekirax have not been investigated. \nTheoretically, Viekirax with and without dasabuvir is expected to increase the exposure to pitavastatin and \nfluvastatin. A temporary suspension of pitavastatin/fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of \n\n\n\n8\n\ntreatment with Viekirax. If statin treatment is required during the treatment period, a switch to a reduced \ndose of pravastatin/rosuvastatin is possible (see section 4.5, Table 2).\n\nTreatment of patients with HIV co-infection\n\nLow dose ritonavir, which is part of the fixed dose combination Viekirax, may select for PI resistance in \nHIV co-infected patients without ongoing antiretroviral therapy. HIV co-infected patients without \nsuppressive antiretroviral therapy should not be treated with Viekirax.\n\nDrug interactions need to be carefully taken into account in the setting of HIV co-infection (for details see \nsection 4.5, Table 2).\n\nAtazanavir can be used in combination with Viekirax and dasabuvir, if administered at the same time. To \nbe noted, atazanavir should be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as \npart of Viekirax. The combination carries an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular \nicterus), in particular when ribavirin is part of the hepatitis C regimen.\n\nDarunavir, dosed 800 mg once daily, if administered at the same time as Viekirax and dasabuvir, can be \nused in the absence of extensive PI resistance (darunavir exposure lowered). To be noted, darunavir \nshould be taken without ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of Viekirax.\n\nHIV protease inhibitors other than atazanavir and darunavir (e.g., indinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, \nlopinavir/ritonavir) are contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nRaltegravir exposure is substantially increased (2-fold). The combination was not linked to any particular \nsafety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 weeks.\n\nRilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination with \nViekirax and dasabuvir, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. If an HIV protease inhibitor is \nadded (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even further and is, therefore, not \nrecommended. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring.\n\nNNRTIs other than rilpivirine (efavirenz, etravirine and nevirapine) are contraindicated (see section 4.3).\n\nHepatitis B virus reactivation\n\nCases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after \ntreatment with direct-acting antiviral medicinal products. HBV screening should be performed in all \npatients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and \nshould, therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.\n\nDepression or psychiatric illness\n\nCases of depression and more rarely of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt have been reported with \nViekirax with or without dasabuvir treatment in combination with ribavirin in the majority of the cases. \nAlthough some cases had previous history of depression, psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse, a \ncausal relation with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir treatment cannot be excluded. Caution should be \nused in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Patients and caregivers \nshould be instructed to notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal \nideation.\n\n\n\n9\n\nUse in diabetic patients \n\nDiabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic hypoglycaemia, \nafter initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic patients initiating direct \nacting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first 3 months, and their \ndiabetic medicinal products modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the diabetic care of the \npatient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is initiated. \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nViekirax may be administered with or without dasabuvir. When co-administered, they exert mutual effects \non each other (see section 5.2). Therefore, the interaction profile of the compounds must be considered as \na combination.\n\nPharmacodynamic interactions\n\nCoadministration with enzyme inducers may increase the risk of adverse reactions and ALT elevations \n(see Table 2). Coadministration with ethinyloestradiol may increase the risk of ALT elevations (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). Examples of contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions\n\nPotential for Viekirax to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\nIn vivo drug interaction studies evaluated the net effect of the combination treatment, including ritonavir.\n\nThe following section describes the specific transporters and metabolizing enzymes that are affected by \nViekirax with or without dasabuvir. See Table 2 for guidance regarding potential interactions with other \nmedicinal products and dosing recommendations.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4\nRitonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with \nmedicinal products primarily metabolized by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of \nthese medicinal products. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for \nwhich elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events are contraindicated (see section 4.3 and \nTable 2). \n\nCYP3A substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies which may require dose adjustment and/or clinical \nmonitoring include (see Table 2) ciclosporin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, amlodipine, rilpivirine and\nalprazolam. Examples of other CYP3A4 substrates which may require dose adjustment and/or clinical \nmonitoring include calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine), and trazodone. Although buprenorphine \nand zolpidem are also metabolized by CYP3A, drug interaction studies indicate that no dose adjustment is \nneeded when co-administering these medicinal products with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir (see \nTable 2). \n\nMedicinal products transported by the OATP family and OCT1\nParitaprevir is an inhibitor of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and paritaprevir \nand ritonavir are inhibitors of OATP2B1. Ritonavir is an in vitro inhibitor of OCT1, but the clinical \nrelevance is unknown. Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products \nthat are substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 or OCT1 may increase plasma concentrations of \nthese transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. Such medicinal \nproducts include some statins (see Table 2), fexofenadine, repaglinide and angiotensin II receptor \nantagonists (e.g., valsartan).\n\n\n\n10\n\nOATP1B1/3 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include pravastatin and rosuvastatin (see \nTable 2). \n\nMedicinal products transported by BCRP\nParitaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are inhibitors of BCRP in vivo. Co-administration of Viekirax with or \nwithout dasabuvir together with medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP may increase plasma \nconcentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose adjustment/clinical monitoring.  \nSuch medicinal products include sulfasalazine, imatinib and some of the statins (see Table 2).\n\nBCRP substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include rosuvastatin (see Table 2).\n\nMedicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine\nWhile paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are in vitro inhibitors of P-gp, no significant change was \nobserved in the exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin when administered with Viekirax and dasabuvir. \nHowever, co-administration of digoxin with Viekirax without dasabuvir may result in increased plasma \nconcentrations (see Table 2). Viekirax may increase the plasma exposure to medicinal products that are \nsensitive for changed intestinal P-gp activity (such as dabigatran etexilate).\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by glucuronidation (UGT1A1)\nParitaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir are inhibitors of UGT1A1. Co-administration of Viekirax with or \nwithout dasabuvir with medicinal products that are primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 result in increased \nplasma concentrations of such medicinal products; routine clinical monitoring is recommended for narrow \ntherapeutic index medicinal products (i.e. levothyroxine). See also Table 2 for specific advice on \nraltegravir and buprenorphine, which have been evaluated in drug interaction studies.\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19\nCo-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir can decrease exposures of medicinal products \nthat are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole, esomeprazole, s-mephenytoin), which may require \ndose adjustment/clinical monitoring. CYP2C19 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include \nomeprazole and escitalopram (see Table 2).\n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9\nViekirax administered with or without dasabuvir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2C9 substrate, \nwarfarin. Other CYP2C9 substrates (NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), antidiabetics (e.g. glimepiride, glipizide) \nare not expected to require dose adjustments. \n\nMedicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2\nViekirax administered with or without dasabuvir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 \nsubstrate, duloxetine. Exposures of cyclobenzaprine, a CYP1A2 substrate, were decreased. Clinical \nmonitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. ciprofloxacin, \ncyclobenzaprine, theophylline and caffeine). CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine, metoprolol and \ndextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments. \n\nMedicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins\nOmbitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir do not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo as shown \nby the lack of interaction with tenofovir (OAT1 substrate). In vitro studies show that ombitasvir, \nparitaprevir, and ritonavir are not inhibitors of organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion \ntransporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically \nrelevant concentrations. \n\nTherefore, Viekirax with or without dasabuvir is not expected to affect medicinal products which are \nprimarily excreted by the renal route via these transporters (see section 5.2). \n\n\n\n11\n\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and \ndasabuvir\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4\nCo-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with strong inhibitors of CYP3A may increase \nparitaprevir concentrations (see section 4.3 and Table 2).\n\nEnzyme inducers\nCo-administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir with medicinal products that are moderate or strong enzyme \ninducers is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir plasma concentrations \nand reduce their therapeutic effect. Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3 and Table \n2.\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 and transport proteins\nParitaprevir is eliminated via CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and biliary excretion (substrate of the hepatic \ntransporters OATP1B1, P-gp and BCRP). Caution is advised if co-administering Viekirax with medicinal \nproducts that are both moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of multiple transporters (P-gp, BCRP \nand/or OATP1B1/ OATP1B3). These medicinal products may show clinically relevant increases in \nexposures of paritaprevir (e.g., ritonavir with atazanavir, erythromycin, diltiazem or verapamil).\n\nMedicinal products that inhibit transport proteins\nPotent inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3 have the potential to increase the exposure \nto paritaprevir. Inhibition of these transporters is not expected to show clinically relevant increases in \nexposures of ombitasvir and dasabuvir.\n\nPatients treated with vitamin K antagonists\n\nAs liver function may change during treatment with Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir, a \nclose monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.\n\nDrug interaction studies\n\nRecommendations for co-administration of Viekirax with and without dasabuvir for a number of \nmedicinal products are provided in Table 2.\n\nIf a patient is already taking medicinal product(s) or initiating a medicinal product while receiving \nViekirax with or without dasabuvir for which potential for drug interaction is expected, dose adjustment of \nthe concomitant medicinal product(s) or appropriate clinical monitoring should be considered (Table 2).\n\nIf dose adjustments of concomitant medicinal products are made due to treatment with Viekirax or \nViekirax with dasabuvir, doses should be re-adjusted after administration of Viekirax or Viekirax with\ndasabuvir is completed.\n\nTable 2 provides the Least Squares Means Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of \nViekirax with or without dasabuvir and concomitant medicinal products. \n\nThe magnitude of interaction when administered with medicinal products listed in Table 2 are similar \n(\u226425% difference in the Least Square Means ratio) for Viekirax with or without dasabuvir, unless \notherwise noted. Drug interactions were evaluated for the Viekirax and dasabuvir regimen, but not for the \nViekirax without dasabuvir, with carbamazepine, furosemide, zolpidem, darunavir twice daily, darunavir \n(evening administration), atazanavir (evening administration), rilpivirine, abacavir/lamivudine, \ndolutegravir, metformin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, hydrocodone/\n\n\n\n12\n\nparacetamol or diazepam. Thus, for these medicinal products, results and dosing recommendations of the \nViekirax and dasabuvir regimen can be extrapolated to Viekirax without dasabuvir.\n\nThe direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (Cmax, and AUC) in \nparitaprevir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and the co-administered medicinal product (\u2191 = increase (more than \n20%), \u2193 = decrease (of more than 20%), \u2194 = no change or change less than 20%). This is not an \nexclusive list.\n\nTable 2.

Dose normalised parameters reported for methadone, buprenorphine and naloxone.\n\nNote: Doses used for Viekirax and dasabuvir were: ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 150 mg, ritonavir 100 mg, \nonce daily and dasabuvir 400 mg twice daily or 250 mg twice daily. The dasabuvir exposures obtained with \nthe 400 mg formulation and the 250 mg tablet are similar. Viekirax with or without dasabuvir was \nadministered as multiple doses in all the drug interaction studies except the drug interaction studies with \ncarbamazepine, gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim..\n\nPaediatric population\n\nDrug interaction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\n\n\n36\n\nWomen of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females\n\nExtreme caution must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients \nwhen Viekirax is taken in combination with ribavirin. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects \nhave been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin; therefore, ribavirin is contraindicated in \nwomen who are pregnant and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Refer to the Summary of \nProduct Characteristics for ribavirin for additional information.\n\nFemale patients: Women of childbearing potential should not receive ribavirin unless they are using an \neffective form of contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 4 months after treatment.\nEthinyloestradiol is contraindicated in combination with Viekirax (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nMale patients and their female partners: Either male patients or their female partners of childbearing \npotential must use a form of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for 7 months after \ntreatment. \n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are very limited data from the use of Viekirax in pregnant women. Studies with ombitasvir and \nparitaprevir/ritonavir in animals have shown malformations (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. Viekirax should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential \nnot using effective contraception.\n\nIf ribavirin is co-administered with Viekirax, the contraindications regarding use of ribavirin during \npregnancy apply (see also the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin).\n\nBreast-feeding\n\nIt is not known whether paritaprevir /ritonavir or ombitasvir and their metabolites are excreted in human \nbreast milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of active substance and \nmetabolite in milk (see section 5.3). Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the medicinal \nproduct in breastfed infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue \ntreatment with Viekirax, taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother. For patients co-\nadministered ribavirin refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of ribavirin.\n\nFertility\n\nNo human data on the effect of Viekirax on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful \neffects on fertility (see section 5.3).\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nViekirax has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \ninformed that fatigue has been reported during treatment with Viekirax in combination with dasabuvir and \nribavirin (see section 4.8).\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nIn subjects receiving Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin, the most commonly reported adverse \nreactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The proportion of subjects who \n\n\n\n37\n\npermanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.2% (5/2,044) and 4.8% (99/2,044) of \nsubjects had ribavirin dose reductions due to adverse reactions.\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe safety summary is based on pooled data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in subjects who received \nViekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 3 \nwere of grade 1 severity in Viekirax and dasabuvir-containing regimens.\n\nThe adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as \nfollows: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).\n\nTable 3.

A side-by-side tabulation is shown to \nsimplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.\n\nTable 4.

As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women taking a concomitant \nethinyloestradiol-containing medicinal product, such medicinal products are contraindicated with Viekirax\nwith or without dasabuvir. No increase in incidence of ALT elevations was observed with other types of \nestrogens commonly used for hormone replacement therapy (e.g. oestradiol and conjugated estrogens). \nALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment \n(mean time 20 days, range 8-57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued \nViekirax and dasabuvir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinyloestradiol. Three interrupted \nViekirax and dasabuvir for one to seven days, including one on ethinyloestradiol. The majority of these \nALT elevations were transient and assessed as drug-related. Elevations in ALT were generally not \nassociated with bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4).\n\nSerum bilirubin elevations\n\nTransient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving \nViekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1/1B3 \nby paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations occurred after initiation of \n\n\n\n39\n\ntreatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing therapy. Bilirubin elevations \nwere not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of indirect bilirubin elevations was \nlower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin.\n\nLiver transplant recipients\n\nThe overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered Viekirax and \ndasabuvir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medications) was similar to subjects \ntreated with Viekirax and dasabuvir and ribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse \nreactions were increased in frequency. 10 subjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin \nvalue of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 subjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in \nhaemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an interruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact \nSVR rates. 5 subjects required erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to \n1200 mg daily. No subject received a blood transfusion.\n\nHIV/HCV co-infected patients\n\nThe overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-\ninfected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin >3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 17 \n(27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with \nhyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases.\n\nGT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD)\nViekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects with genotype 1 infection \nwith or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see Section 5.1). The overall safety \nprofile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that seen in prior Phase 3 studies in \nsubjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater proportion of subjects required intervention \ndue to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was \n12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 \ng/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of \nthese subjects were also treated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 \ng/dL.  Two subjects received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 \nGT1b-infected subjects who did not receive ribavirin. Viekirax with or without dasabuvir was also \nevaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia were \nseen in these subjects.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety of Viekirax in children and adolescents aged < 18 years has not yet been established. No data \nare available.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are \nasked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThe highest documented single dose administered to healthy volunteers was 400 mg for paritaprevir (with \n100 mg ritonavir), 200 mg for ritonavir (with 100 mg paritaprevir) and 350 mg for ombitasvir. No study \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n40\n\nrelated adverse reactions with paritaprevir, ritonavir, or ombitasvir were observed. Transient increases in \nindirect bilirubin were observed at the highest doses of paritaprevir/ritonavir. In case of overdose, it is \nrecommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and \nappropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.\n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; direct-acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP53\n\nMechanism of action\n\nViekirax, when co-administered with dasabuvir, combines three direct-acting antiviral medicinal products\nwith distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps \nin the viral lifecycle. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of dasabuvir for its \npharmacological properties.\n\nRitonavir\nRitonavir is not active against HCV. Ritonavir is a CYP3A inhibitor that increases the systemic exposure \nof the CYP3A substrate paritaprevir. \n\nOmbitasvir\nOmbitasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A which is essential for viral replication. \n\nParitaprevir\nParitaprevir is an inhibitor of HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the \nHCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and \nis essential for viral replication.\n\nActivity in cell culture and/or biochemical studies\n\nOmbitasvir\nThe EC50 of ombitasvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays \nwas 14.1 and 5 pM, respectively. The activity of ombitasvir was attenuated 11- to 13-fold in the presence \nof 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of ombitasvir against replicons containing NS5A from a panel of \ntreatment-na\u00efve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture assay was 0.66 pM (range \n0.35 to 0.88 pM; n=11) and 1.0 pM (range 0.74 to 1.5 pM; n=11), respectively. Ombitasvir has EC50\nvalues of 12, 4.3, 19, 1.7, 3.2, and 366 pM against replicon cell lines constructed with NS5A from single \nisolates representing genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a, respectively.\n\nParitaprevir\nThe EC50 of paritaprevir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in the HCV replicon cell culture \nassay was 1.0 and 0.21 nM, respectively. The activity of paritaprevir was attenuated 24 to 27 -fold in the \npresence of 40% human plasma. The mean EC50 of paritaprevir against replicons containing NS3 from a \npanel of treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1a and 1b isolates in the HCV replicon cell culture assay was 0.86 nM \n(range 0.43 to 1.87 nM; n=11) and 0.06 nM (range 0.03 to 0.09 nM; n=9), respectively. Paritaprevir had \nan EC50 value of 5.3 nM against the 2a-JFH-1 replicon cell line, and EC50 values of 19, 0.09, and 0.68 nM \nagainst replicon cell lines containing NS3 from a single isolate each of genotype 3a, 4a, and 6a, \nrespectively\nRitonavir did not exhibit a direct antiviral effect on the replication of HCV subgenomic replicons, and the \npresence of ritonavir did not affect the in vitro antiviral activity of paritaprevir.\n\n\n\n41\n\nResistance\n\nIn cell culture\n\nGenotype 1\n\nResistance to paritaprevir and ombitasvir conferred by variants in NS3 and NS5A respectively, selected in \ncell culture or identified in Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials were phenotypically characterised in the \nappropriate genotype 1a or 1b replicons.\n\nIn genotype 1a, substitutions F43L, R155K, A156T, and D168A/F/H/V/Y in HCV NS3 reduced \nsusceptibility to paritaprevir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of paritaprevir was reduced 20-, 37-, \nand 17-fold by the F43L, R155K and A156T substitutions, respectively. The activity of paritaprevir was \nreduced 96-fold by D168V, and 50- to 219-fold by each of the other D168 substitutions. The activity of \nparitaprevir in genotype 1a was not significantly affected (less than or equal to 3-fold) by single \nsubstitutions V36A/M, V55I, Y56H, Q80K or E357K. Double variants including combinations of \nV36LM, F43L, Y56H, Q80K or E357K with R155K or with a D168 substitution reduced the activity of \nparitaprevir by an additional 2 to 3-fold relative to the single R155K or D168 substitution. In the genotype \n1b replicon, the activity of paritaprevir was reduced 76- and 159-and 337- fold by D168A, D168H, \nD168V, and D168Y respectively. Y56H alone could not be evaluated due to poor replication capacity, \nhowever, the combination of Y56H and D168A/V/Y reduced the activity of paritaprevir by 700- to 4118-\nfold.\n\nIn genotype 1a, substitutions M28T/V, Q30E/R, L31V, H58D, Y93C/H/N, and M28V + Q30R in HCV \nNS5A reduced susceptibility to ombitasvir. In the genotype 1a replicon, the activity of ombitasvir was \nreduced by 896-, 58- and 243-fold against the M28T/V and H58D substitutions, respectively, and 1326-, \n800-, 155-foldand 1675- to 66740- fold by the Q30E/R, L31V and Y93C/H/N substitutions, respectively. \nY93H, Y93N or M28V in combination with Q30R reduced the activity of ombitasvir by more than \n42,802-fold. In genotype 1b, substitutions L28T, L31F/V, as well as Y93H alone or in combination with \nL28M, R30Q, L31F/M/V or P58S in HCV NS5A reduced susceptibility to ombitasvir. In the genotype 1b \nreplicon, the activity of ombitasvir was reduced by less than 10-fold by variants at amino acid positions 30 \nand 31. The activity of ombitasvir was reduced by 661-, 77-, 284- and 142-fold against the genotype 1b \nsubstitutions L28T, Y93H, R30Q in combination with Y93H, and L31M in combination with Y93H, \nrespectively. All other double substitutions of Y93H in combination with substitutions at positions 28, 31, \nor 58 reduced the activity of ombitasvir by more than 400-fold.\n\nGenotype 4\n\nIn genotype 4a, resistance to paritaprevir or ombitasvir by variants in NS3 or NS5A, respectively, selected \nin cell culture were phenotypically characterised. Substitutions R155C, A156T/V, and D168H/V in HCV \nNS3 reduced susceptibility to paritaprevir by 40- to 323-fold. Substitution L28V in HCV NS5A reduced \nthe susceptibility to ombitasvir by 21-fold.\n\nEffect of baseline HCV substitutions/polymorphisms on treatment outcome\nA pooled analysis of subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, who were treated with ombitasvir, \nparitaprevir, and dasabuvir (a non-nucleotide NS5B inhibitor) with or without ribavirin in the Phase 2b \nand 3 clinical trials was conducted to explore the association between baseline NS3/4A, NS5A or NS5B \nsubstitutions/polymorphisms and treatment outcome in recommended regimens.\n\nIn the greater than 500 genotype 1a baseline samples in this analysis, the most frequently observed \nresistance-associated variants were M28V (7.4%) in NS5A and S556G (2.9%) in NS5B. Q80K, although a \nhighly prevalent polymorphism in NS3 (41.2% of samples), confers minimal resistance to paritaprevir. \n\n\n\n42\n\nResistance-associated variants at amino acid positions R155 and D168 in NS3 were rarely observed (less \nthan 1%) at baseline. In the greater than 200 genotype 1b baseline samples in this analysis, the most \nfrequently observed resistance-associated variants observed were Y93H (7.5%) in NS5A, and C316N \n(17.0%) and S556G (15%) in NS5B. Given the low virologic failure rates observed with recommended \ntreatment regimens for HCV genotype 1a- and 1b-infected subjects, the presence of baseline variants \nappears to have little impact on the likelihood of achieving SVR.\n\nIn clinical studies\nOf the 2,510 HCV genotype 1 infected subjects who were treated with regimens containing ombitasvir, \nparitaprevir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (for 8, 12, or 24 weeks) in Phase 2b and 3 clinical \ntrials, a total of 74 subjects (3%) experienced virologic failure (primarily post-treatment relapse). \nTreatment-emergent variants and their prevalence in these virologic failure populations are shown in \nTable 5. In the 67 genotype 1a infected subjects, NS3 variants were observed in 50 subjects, NS5A \nvariants were observed in 46 subjects, NS5B variants were observed in 37 subjects, and treatment-\nemergent variants were seen in all 3 drug targets in 30 subjects. In the 7 genotype 1b infected subjects, \ntreatment-emergent variants were observed in NS3 in 4 subjects, in NS5A in 2 subjects, and in both NS3 \nand NS5A in 1 subject. No genotype 1b infected subjects had treatment-emergent variants in all 3 drug \ntargets.\n\nTable 5.

Ombitasvir treatment-emergent variants M28T, M28V or Q30R in NS5A were observed in 32 \nsubjects. Dasabuvir treatment-emergent variants M414T, G554S, S556G, G558R or D559G/N in NS5B \nwere observed in 34 subjects.\n\nNS3 variants V36A/M and R155K and NS5B variants M414T and S556G remained detectable at post-\ntreatment Week 48, whereas NS3 variant D168V and all other NS5B variants were not observed at post-\ntreatment Week 48. All treatment-emergent variants in NS5A remained detectable at post-treatment Week \n48. Due to high SVR rates in genotype 1b, trends in persistence of treatment-emergent variants in this \ngenotype could not be established.\n\nThe lack of detection of virus containing a resistance-associated substitution does not indicate that the \nresistant virus is no longer present at clinically significant levels. The long-term clinical impact of the \nemergence or persistence of virus containing Viekirax- and dasabuvir-resistance-associated substitutions\non future treatment is unknown.\n\nCross-resistance\n\nCross-resistance is expected among NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside \nNS5B inhibitors by class. The impact of prior ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir treatment experience \non the efficacy of other NS5A inhibitors, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, or NS5B inhibitors has not been \nstudied.\n\nClinical efficacy and safety\n\nClinical studies in subjects with genotype 1 hepatitis C infection\nThe efficacy and safety of Viekirax in combination with dasabuvir with and without ribavirin was \nevaluated in eight Phase 3 clinical trials, including two trials exclusively in subjects with cirrhosis (Child-\nPugh A), in over 2,360 subjects with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection as summarised in Table 6.\n\n\n\n44\n\nTable 6.

For subjects who received ribavirin, the ribavirin dose was 1000 mg per day for \nsubjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg per day for subjects weighing greater than or equal to 75 kg.\n\nSustained virologic response (SVR) was the primary endpoint to determine the HCV cure rate in the Phase \n3 studies and was defined as unquantifiable or undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of \ntreatment (SVR12). Treatment duration was fixed in each trial and was not guided by subjects\u2019 HCV RNA \nlevels (no response guided algorithm).

PEARL I was conducted in the US and Europe, M12-\n536 in Japan. The treatment-experienced subjects studied were primarily pegIFN/RBV null responders. \nThe doses of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir were 25 mg 150 mg, 100 mg once daily in PEARL-I, while \nthe dose of paritaprevir was 100 mg or 150 mg in study M12-536. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for \ntreatment na\u00efve subjects, 12-24 weeks for treatment experienced subjects and 24 weeks for subjects with \ncirrhosis. Overall, 107 of 113 subjects without cirrhosis and 147 of 155 subjects with cirrhosis achieved \nSVR12 after 12-24 weeks of treatment.\n\nViekirax with ribavirin & without dasabuvir was evaluated for 12 weeks in genotype 1 treatment naive \nand treatment experienced non-cirrhotic subjects in a phase 2 study M11-652 (AVIATOR). The doses of \nparitaprevir were 100 mg and 200 mg and ombitasvir 25 mg. Ribavirin was dosed based on weight (1000 \nmg \u2013 1200 mg per day). Overall, 72 of 79 treatment-naive subjects (45 of 52 GT1a and 27 of 27 GT1b) \nand 40 of 45 treatment-experienced subjects (21 of 26 GT1a and 19 of 19 GT1b) achieved SVR12 after 12 \nweeks of treatment. \n\nImpact of ribavirin dose adjustment on probability of SVR\n\nIn Phase 3 clinical trials, 91.5% of subjects did not require ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy. In \nthe 8.5% of subjects who had ribavirin dose adjustments during therapy, the SVR rate (98.5%) was \ncomparable to subjects who maintained their starting ribavirin dose throughout treatment.\n\n\n\n51\n\nTURQUOISE-I: treatment-na\u00efve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced with HCV GT1 or GT4/HIV-1 co-\ninfection, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis\n\nDesign: randomised, global multicentre, open-label\nTreatment: Viekirax with or without dasabuvir coadminstered with or without weight-based ribavirin \nfor 12 or 24 weeks\n\nSee section 4.2 for dosing recommendations in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients. HCV GT1- or 4-infected \nsubjects with HIV-1 coinfection were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen that \nincluded ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, raltegravir, dolutegravir (Part 2 only), or darunavir (Part 1b and Part \n2 GT4 only)-, co-administered with a backbone of tenofovir plus emtricitabine or lamivudine.\n\nPart 1 of the study was a Phase 2 pilot cohort consisting of 2 parts, Part 1a (63 subjects) and Part 1b (22 \nsubjects). Part 2 was a Phase 3 cohort consisting of 233 subjects.  \n\nIn Part 1a, all subjects received Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks.  \nTreated subjects (N = 63) had a median age of 51 years (range: 31 to 69); 24% were Black; 19% had \ncompensated cirrhosis; 67% were treatment-na\u00efve; 33% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; \n89% had HCV genotype 1a infection. \n\nIn Part 1b, all subjects received Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks.  Treated subjects (N = \n22) had a median age of 54 years (range: 34 to 68); 41% were Black; 14% had compensated cirrhosis; \n86% were HCV treatment-na\u00efve; 14% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 68% had HCV \ngenotype 1a infection.\n\nIn Part 2, subjects with HCV GT1 received Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin for 12 or 24 \nweeks.  Subjects with HCV GT4 received Viekirax with ribavirin for 12 or 24 Weeks.  Treated subjects \n(N = 233) had a median age of 49 years (range: 26 to 69); 10% were Black; 12% had compensated \ncirrhosis; 66% were treatment-na\u00efve; 32% had failed prior treatment with pegIFN/RBV; 2% had failed \nprior treatment with sofosbuvir.\n\nTable 17 shows the primary efficacy analysis of SVR12 performed on  subjects with HCV GT1/HIV-1 co-\ninfection that received recommended regimen in Part 2 of the TURQUOISE-I study.  \n\nTable 17.

In Part \n1a, SVR12 was achieved by 29/31 (93.5%) subjects on the 12-week arm (95% CI: 79.3%, 98.2%) and by \n29/32 (90.6%) subjects on the 24-week arm (95% CI: 75.8% \u2013 96.8%). There was 1 relapse in the 12-\nweek arm and 1 on-treatment virologic failure in the 24-week arm. In Part 1b, SVR12 was achieved by \n22/22 (100%) subjects (95% CI: 85.1%, 100%). In Part 2, SVR12 was achieved by 27/28 (96.4%) subjects \nwith HCV GT4/HIV-1 coinfection (95% CI: 82.3%, 99.4%) with no virologic failures.\n\nThe SVR12 rates in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects were thus consistent with SVR12 rates in the phase \n3 trials of HCV mono-infected subjects. \n\nCORAL-I: treatment-na\u00efve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced, at least 3 months post liver transplant or \n12 months post renal transplant\n\nDesign: randomised, global multicentre, open-label\nTreatment: Viekirax and dasabuvir for 12 or 24 weeks with or without ribavirin ( investigator chosen \ndose ) for GT1 and GT4 infection \n\nIn subjects with liver transplant, no cirrhosis and GT1 infection, patients were dosed with Viekirax and \ndasabuvir for 12-24 weeks, with and without RBV. Liver transplant subjects with cirrhosis were dosed \nwith Viekirax and dasabuvir with RBV (GT1a for 24 weeks [n=4], GT1b for 12 weeks [n=2]). Subjects \nwith renal transplant and no cirrhosis were dosed for 12 weeks (with RBV for GT1a [n=9], without RBV \nfor GT1b [n=3]). Subjects with liver transplant and GT4 infection were dosed with Viekirax with RBV \n(non-cirrhotic for 12 weeks [n=2] and cirrhotic for 24 weeks [n=1]. The dose of ribavirin was left to the \ndiscretion of the investigator, with most subjects receiving 600 to 800 mg per day as a starting dose, and \nmost subjects also receiving 600 to 800 mg per day at the end of treatment.\n\nA total of 129 subjects were treated, 84 with GT1a, 41 with GT1b, 1 with GT1 other, 3 with GT4 \ninfection. Overall, 61% had fibrosis stage F0-F1, 26% F2, 9% F3, and 4% F4.  61% had prior HCV \ntreatment experience before transplant. For immunosuppressive medication, most subjects were taking \ntacrolimus (81%), with the remainder taking cyclosporine.\n\nAmong all GT1 subjects who were post liver transplant, 111/114 (97.4%) achieved SVR12; with 2 \nrelapsing post treatment and 1 breakthrough on treatment.  Among the GT1 subjects who were post renal \ntransplant, 9/12 (75%) achieved SVR12; however, there were no virologic failures. All 3 (100%) subjects \nwith GT4 infection who were post liver transplant achieved SVR12.\n\nClinical trial in patients receiving opioid substitution therapy\n\nIn a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single arm study, 38 treatment-na\u00efve or pegIFN/RBV treatment \nexperienced, non-cirrhotic subjects with genotype 1 infection who were on stable doses of methadone \n(N=19) or buprenorphine +/- naloxone (N=19) received 12 weeks of Viekirax and dasabuvir with \nribavirin. Treated subjects had a median age of 51 years (range: 26 to 64); 65.8% were male and 5.3% \nwere Black. A majority (86.8%) had baseline HCV RNA levels of at least 800,000 IU/mL and a majority \n(84.2%) had genotype 1a infection; 15.8% had portal fibrosis (F2) and 5.3% had bridging fibrosis (F3); \nand 94.7% were na\u00efve to prior HCV treatment. \n\nOverall, 37 (97.4%) of 38 subjects achieved SVR12.

Table 20 shows mean Cmax and AUC of \nViekirax 25 mg/150 mg/100 mg once daily with dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily following multiple doses \nwith food in healthy volunteers.\n\nTable 20. Geometric mean Cmax, AUC of multiple doses of Viekirax 150 mg/100 mg/25 mg once daily \nwith dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily with food in healthy volunteers\n\nCmax (ng/ml) (% CV) AUC (ng*hr/ml) (% CV)\n\nOmbitasvir 127 (31) 1420 (36)\n\nParitaprevir 1470 (87) 6990 (96)\n\nRitonavir 1600 (40) 9470 (41)\n\nAbsorption\n\nOmbitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir were absorbed after oral administration with mean Tmax of \napproximately 4 to 5 hours. While ombitasvir exposures increased in a dose proportional manner, \nparitaprevir and ritonavir exposures increased in a more than dose proportional manner. Accumulation is \nminimal for ombitasvir and approximately 1.5- to 2-fold for ritonavir and paritaprevir. Pharmacokinetic \nsteady state for the combination is achieved after approximately 12 days of dosing.\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of ombitasvir and paritaprevir was approximately 50% when administered\nwith food as Viekirax.\n\n\n\n55\n\nEffect of paritaprevir/ritonavir on ombitasvir and dasabuvir \n\nIn the presence of paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir exposures decreased by approximately 50% to 60% \nwhile ombitasvir exposures increased by 31-47%.\n\nEffect of ombitasvir on paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir\n\nIn the presence of ombitasvir, paritaprevir exposures were minimally affected (5% to 27% change) while \ndasabuvir exposures increase by approximately 30%.\n\nEffect of dasabuvir on paritaprevir/ritonavir and ombitasvir\n\nIn the presence of dasabuvir, paritaprevir exposures increased by 50% to 65% while there was no change \nin ombitasvir exposures.\n\nEffects of food\n\nOmbitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir should be administered with food. All clinical trials with ombitasvir, \nparitaprevir and ritonavir have been conducted following administration with food.\n\nFood increased the exposure (AUC) of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir by up to 82%, 211% and \n49%, respectively relative to the fasting state. The increase in exposure was similar regardless of meal \ntype (e.g., high-fat versus moderate-fat) or calorie content (approximately 600 Kcal versus approximately \n1000 Kcal). To maximise absorption, Viekirax should be taken with food without regard to fat or calorie \ncontent.\n\nDistribution\n\nOmbitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is not \nmeaningfully altered in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood to plasma concentration \nratios in humans ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 indicating that ombitasvir and paritaprevir were preferentially \ndistributed in the plasma compartment of whole blood. Ombitasvir was approximately 99.9% bound to \nhuman plasma proteins. Paritaprevir was approximately 97-98.6% bound to human plasma proteins. \nRitonavir was greater than 99% bound to human plasma proteins.\n\nIn vitro data indicate that paritaprevir is a substrate for the human hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 \nand OATP1B3.\n\nBiotransformation\n\nOmbitasvir\n\nOmbitasvir is metabolised via amide hydrolysis followed by oxidative metabolism. Following a 25 mg \nsingle dose of 14C-ombitasvir given alone, unchanged parent drug accounted for 8.9% of total radioactivity \nin human plasma; a total of 13 metabolites were identified in human plasma. These metabolites are not \nexpected to have antiviral activity or off-target pharmacologic activity.\n\nParitaprevir\n\nParitaprevir is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP3A5. Following \nadministration of a single 200 mg/100 mg oral dose of 14C paritaprevir /ritonavir to humans, the parent \ndrug was the major circulating component, accounting for approximately 90% of the plasma radioactivity. \nAt least 5 minor metabolites of paritaprevir have been identified in circulation that accounted for \napproximately 10% of plasma radioactivity. These metabolites are not expected to have antiviral activity.\n\n\n\n56\n\nRitonavir\n\nRitonavir is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A and to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Nearly the entire \nplasma radioactivity after a single 600 mg dose of 14C-ritonavir oral solution in humans was attributed to \nunchanged ritonavir.\n\nElimination\n\nOmbitasvir\n\nFollowing dosing of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, mean plasma half-life of \nombitasvir was approximately 21 to 25 hours. Following a single 25 mg dose of 14C- ombitasvir\napproximately 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 2% in urine. Unchanged parent drug \naccounted for 88% of total radioactivity recovered in faeces, indicating that biliary excretion is a major \nelimination pathway for ombitasvir. \n\nParitaprevir\n\nFollowing dosing of ombitasvir/paritaprevir /ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, mean plasma half-life of \nparitaprevir was approximately 5.5 hours. Following a 200 mg 14C -paritaprevir dose with 100 mg \nritonavir, approximately 88% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces with limited radioactivity \n(8.8%) in urine. Metabolism as well as biliary excretion of parent drug contribute to the elimination of \nparitaprevir.\n\nRitonavir\n\nFollowing dosing of ombitasvir/paritaprevir /ritonavir, mean plasma half-life of ritonavir was \napproximately 4 hours. Following a 600 mg dose of 14C -ritonavir oral solution, 86.4% of the radioactivity \nwas recovered in the faeces and 11.3% of the dose was excreted in the urine.\n\nIn vitro interaction data\n\nOmbitasvir and paritaprevir do not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo and are not expected \nto inhibit organic cation transporters (OCT1 and OCT2), organic anion transporters (OAT3), or multidrug \nand toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at clinically relevant concentrations. Ritonavir does \nnot inhibit OAT1 and is not expected to inhibit OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K at clinically \nrelevant concentrations.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, a 10 year increase or \ndecrease in age from 54 years (median age in the Phase 3 studies) would result in approximately 10% \nchange in ombitasvir exposures, and \u226420% change in paritaprevir exposures. There is no pharmacokinetic\ninformation in patients >75 years.\n\nSex or body weight\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, female subjects \nwould have approximately 55% higher, 100% higher and 15% higher ombitasvir, paritaprevir and \nritonavir exposures than male subjects. However, no dose-adjustment based on gender is warranted. A \n\n\n\n57\n\n10 kg change in body weight from 76 kg (median weight in the Phase 3 studies) would results in <10% \nchange in ombitasvir exposures, and no change in paritaprevir exposures. Body weight is not a significant \npredictor of ritonavir exposures.\n\nRace or ethnicity\n\nBased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from Phase 3 clinical studies, Asian subjects had \n18% to 21% higher ombitasvir exposures, and 37% to 39% higher paritaprevir exposures than non-Asian \nsubjects. The ritonavir exposures were comparable between Asians and non-Asians.\n\nRenal impairment\n\nThe changes in ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir exposures in subjects with mild, moderate and \nsevere renal impairment are not considered to be clinically significant. Limited data in patients with end-\nstage renal disease indicate no clinically significant changes in exposure also in this patient group. No \ndose adjustment of Viekirax with and without dasabuvir is required for patients with mild, moderate or \nsevere renal impairment , or end-stage-renal disease on dialysis (see section 4.2). \n\nPharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 150 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, \nwith or without dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in subjects with mild (CrCl: 60 to 89 ml/min), moderate \n(CrCl: 30 to 59 ml/min) and severe (CrCl: 15 to 29 ml/min) renal impairment.\n\nFollowing administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir\n\nCompared to the subjects with normal renal function, ombitasvir exposures were comparable in subjects \nwith mild, moderate and severe renal impairment. Compared to the subjects with normal renal function, \nparitaprevir Cmax values were comparable, but AUC values were 19%, 33% and 45% higher in mild, \nmoderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. Ritonavir plasma concentrations increased when \nrenal function was reduced: Cmax and AUC values were 26% to 42% higher, 48% to 80% higher and 66% \nto 114% higher in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.\n\nFollowing administration of Viekirax\n\nFollowing administration of Viekirax, the changes in ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir exposures in \nsubjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment were similar to those observed when Viekirax\nwas administered with dasabuvir, and are not considered to be clinically significant. \n\nHepatic impairment\n\nFollowing administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir\n\nPharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, \nwith dasabuvir 400 mg were evaluated in non-HCV infected subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate \n(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment.\n\nIn subjects with mild hepatic impairment, paritaprevir, ritonavir and ombitasvir mean Cmax and AUC \nvalues decreased by 29% to 48%, 34% to 38% and up to 8%, respectively, compared to subjects with \nnormal hepatic function.\n\nIn subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, ombitasvir and ritonavir mean Cmax and AUC values \ndecreased by 29% to 30% and 30 to 33%, respectively, while paritaprevir mean Cmax and AUC values\nincreased by 26% to 62% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and \n4.8).\n\n\n\n58\n\nIn subjects with severe hepatic impairment, paritaprevir mean Cmax and AUC values increased by 3.2-to \n9.5-fold; ritonavir mean Cmax values were 35% lower and AUC values were 13% higher and ombitasvir\nmean Cmax and AUC values decreased by 68% and 54%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal \nhepatic function, therefore, Viekirax must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.4).\n\nIn HCV-infected subjects, in comparison to those without cirrhosis, paritaprevir AUC increased to 2.2- to \n2.4-fold for those with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) and 3- to 4-fold for those with Child-Pugh B \ncirrhosis.\n\nFollowing administration of Viekirax\n\nPharmacokinetics of the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg \nwere not evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-\nPugh C) hepatic impairment. Results from the pharmacokinetic evaluation of the combination of \nombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg, with dasabuvir 400 mg can be extrapolated \nto the combination of ombitasvir 25 mg, paritaprevir 200 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of Viekirax in paediatric patients has not been established (see section 4.2).\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nOmbitasvir\n\nOmbitasvir and its major inactive human metabolites (M29, M36) were not genotoxic in a battery of in \nvitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral \nblood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nOmbitasvir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage tested \n(150 mg/kg/day), resulting in ombitasvir AUC exposures approximately 26-fold higher than those in \nhumans at the recommended clinical dose of 25 mg.\n\nSimilarly, ombitasvir was not carcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dose tested (30 mg per \nkg per day), resulting in ombitasvir exposures approximately 16-fold higher than those in humans at 25 \nmg.\n\nOmbitasvir has shown malformations in rabbits at maximal feasible exposures 4-fold higher than the AUC \nexposure at recommended clinical dose. Malformations at low incidence were observed mainly in the eyes \n(microphthalmia) and teeth (absent incisors). In mice, an increased incidence of open eye lid was present \nin foetuses of dams administered ombitasvir; however, the relationship to treatment with ombitasvir is \nuncertain. The major, inactive human metabolites of ombitasvir were not teratogenic in mice at exposures \napproximately 26 times higher than in humans at the recommended clinical dose. Ombitasvir had no effect \non fertility when evaluated in mice.\nUnchanged ombitasvir was the predominant component observed in the milk of lactating rats, without \neffect on nursing pups. Ombitasvir-derived material was minimally transferred through the placenta in \npregnant rats.\n\nParitaprevir/ritonavir\n\n\n\n59\n\nParitaprevir was positive in an in vitro human chromosome aberration test. Paritaprevir was negative in a \nbacterial mutation assay, and in two in vivo genetic toxicology assays (rat bone marrow micronucleus and \nrat liver Comet tests).\n\nParitaprevir /ritonavir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study up to the highest dosage \ntested (300 mg/30 mg/kg/day), resulting in paritaprevir AUC exposures approximately 38-fold higher than \nthose in humans at the recommended dose of 150 mg. Similarly, paritaprevir/ritonavir was not \ncarcinogenic in a 2-year rat study up to the highest dosage tested (300 mg/30 mg/kg/day), resulting in \nparitaprevir AUC exposures approximately 8-fold higher than those in humans at 150 mg.\n\nParitaprevir/ritonavir has shown malformations (open eye lids) at a low incidence in mice at exposures \n32/8-fold higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose. Paritaprevir/ritonavir had \nno effects on embryo-foetal viability or on fertility when evaluated in rats at exposures 2- to 8-fold higher \nthan the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose.\nParitaprevir and its hydrolysis product M13 were the predominant components observed in the milk of \nlactating rats, without effect on nursing pups. Paritaprevir -derived material was minimally transferred \nthrough the placenta in pregnant rats.\n\n6.

What Viekirax is and what it is used for\n\nViekirax contains the active substances ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir. It is an antiviral medicine \nused to treat adults with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused \nby the hepatitis C virus). \nThe combined action of the three active substances stops the hepatitis C virus from multiplying and \ninfecting new cells, thus clearing the virus from your blood over a period of time. Ombitasvir and\nparitaprevir block two proteins essential for the virus to multiply. Ritonavir acts as a \u2018booster\u2019 to prolong \nthe action of paritaprevir in the body.\n\nViekirax tablets are taken with other antiviral medicines such as dasabuvir and ribavirin. Your doctor will \ntalk with you about which of these medicines to take with Viekirax.\n\nIt is very important that you also read the package leaflets for the other antiviral medicines that you take \nwith Viekirax.
