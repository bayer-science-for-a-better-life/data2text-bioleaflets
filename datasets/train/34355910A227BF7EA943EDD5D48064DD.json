CLINICAL PARTICULARS  \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nAMGEVITA in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:  \n\uf0b7 the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the \n\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been \ninadequate.  \n\n\uf0b7 the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously \ntreated with methotrexate.  \n\n \nAMGEVITA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued \ntreatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.  \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nAMGEVITA reduces the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by x-ray and improves \nphysical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nAMGEVITA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular \njuvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response \nto one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). AMGEVITA can be given as \nmonotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is \ninappropriate (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in \npatients aged less than 2 years. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of \nage and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy \n(see section 5.1). \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS)  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who \nhave had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without \nradiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, \nwho have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when \nthe response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. \nAMGEVITA reduces the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by x-ray in \npatients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and improves physical \nfunction.  \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult \npatients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and \nadolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate \ncandidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne \ninversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional \nsystemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease, in adult \npatients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid \nand/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies. \n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in \npaediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy \nincluding primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are \nintolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult \npatients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-\nmercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies. \n \nUveitis \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in \nadult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of \ncorticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nAMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in \npatients from 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional \ntherapy, or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. \n \n4.2  Posology and method of administration  \n \nAMGEVITA treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of conditions for which AMGEVITA is indicated. Ophthalmologists are \nadvised to consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with AMGEVITA (see \nsection 4.4). Patients treated with AMGEVITA should be given the Patient Reminder Card.  \n \nAfter proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with AMGEVITA if their \nphysician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  \n \nDuring treatment with AMGEVITA, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or \nimmunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nPosology \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg \nadalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate \nshould be continued during treatment with AMGEVITA.  \n \nGlucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued \nduring treatment with AMGEVITA. Regarding combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \ndrugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1.  \n \nIn monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to AMGEVITA 40 mg \nevery other week may benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg \nevery other week. \n \nAvailable adalimumab data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of \ntreatment. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time \nperiod. \n \nDose interruption  \n \nThere may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs.  \n \nRe-introduction of AMGEVITA after discontinuation for 70 days or longer should result in the same \nmagnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose interruption. \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic \narthritis  \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg \nadalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. \n \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. \nContinued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered \nsubcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the \ninitial dose. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period.  \n \nBeyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week may \nbenefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and \nrisks of continued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered \nin a patient with an inadequate response after the increase in dosage (see section 5.1). If adequate \nresponse is achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dosage may subsequently \nbe reduced to 40 mg every other week. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThe recommended AMGEVITA dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is \n160 mg initially at day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day \nfor two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at day 15 (given as two 40 mg \ninjections in one day). Two weeks later (day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg \nevery other week (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during \ntreatment with AMGEVITA if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical \nantiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with AMGEVITA. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period.  \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, AMGEVITA 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be \nre-introduced (see section 5.1).  \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease  \n \nThe recommended AMGEVITA induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely \nactive Crohn\u2019s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a \nmore rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one \nday or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), 80 mg at week 2 (given as two \n40 mg injections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is higher \nduring induction.  \n \nAfter induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous \ninjection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped AMGEVITA and signs and symptoms of disease \nrecur, AMGEVITA may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after \nmore than 8 weeks since the previous dose. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week \nmay benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg AMGEVITA every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \nSome patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy \nthrough week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding \nwithin this time period.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nThe recommended AMGEVITA induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe \nulcerative colitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg \ninjections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in \none day). After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection. \n \nDuring maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice \nguidelines.  \n \nSome patients who experience decrease in their response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week \nmay benefit from an increase in dosage to 40 mg AMGEVITA every week or 80 mg every other week.  \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. AMGEVITA therapy should not \nbe continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, \nfollowed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited \nexperience in the initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with AMGEVITA can be \ninitiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory \nagents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two \nweeks after initiating treatment with AMGEVITA. \n \nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \n \nNo dose adjustment is required.  \n \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in these patient populations. No dose recommendations can be \nmade. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis from 2 years of age \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \nfrom 2 years of age is based on body weight (table 1). AMGEVITA is administered every other week \nvia subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 1. AMGEVITA Dose for Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n10 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n\n \nClinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be \ncarefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in patients aged less than 2 years for this indication.  \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis from 6 years of \nage is based on body weight (table 2). AMGEVITA is administered every other week via \nsubcutaneous injection.  \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 2. AMGEVITA Dose for Patients with Enthesitis-Related Arthritis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg 20 mg every other week \n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week \n\n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years. \n \nPaediatric plaque psoriasis  \n \nThe recommended AMGEVITA dose for patients with plaque psoriasis from 4 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (table 3). AMGEVITA is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nTable 3. AMGEVITA Dose for Paediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis  \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n15 kg to < 30 kg Initial dose of 20 mg, followed by 20 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n\u2265 30 kg Initial dose of 40 mg, followed by 40 mg given every \n\nother week starting one week after the initial dose \n \nContinued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully considered in a patient not responding within \nthis time period. \n \nIf retreatment with AMGEVITA is indicated, the above guidance on dose and treatment duration \nshould be followed.  \n \nThe safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of \n13 months.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.  \n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of \nAMGEVITA in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation \n(see section 5.2). \n \nThe recommended AMGEVITA dose is 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week \nstarting at Week 1 via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn adolescent patients with inadequate response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week, an increase \nin dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. \n \nAntibiotics may be continued during treatment with AMGEVITA if necessary. It is recommended that \nthe patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment \nwith AMGEVITA. \n \nContinued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no \nimprovement within this time period. \n \nShould treatment be interrupted, AMGEVITA may be re-introduced as appropriate. \n \nThe benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data \nin section 5.1). \n \nThere is no relevant use of AMGEVITA in children aged less than 12 years in this indication. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nPaediatric Crohn's disease  \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from 6 to 17 years of age is \nbased on body weight (table 4). AMGEVITA is administered via subcutaneous injection.  \n \nTable 4. AMGEVITA Dose for Paediatric Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease \n \nPatient \nWeight \n\nInduction Dose Maintenance \nDose \nStarting at \nWeek 4 \n\n< 40 kg \uf0b7 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\uf0b7 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2\n\n20 mg every \nother week \n\n\u2265 40 kg \uf0b7 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2 \n \n\nIn case there is a need for a more rapid response to therapy with the \nawareness that the risk for adverse events may be higher with use of the \nhigher induction dose, the following dose may be used: \n\uf0b7 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2\n\n40 mg every \nother week \n\n \nPatients who experience insufficient response may benefit from an increase in dosage: \n\uf0b7 < 40 kg: 20 mg every week \n\uf0b7 \u2265 40 kg: 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week \n \nContinued therapy should be carefully considered in a subject not responding by week 12.  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 6 years for this indication.  \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe recommended dose of AMGEVITA for paediatric patients with uveitis from 2 years of age is \nbased on body weight (table 5). AMGEVITA is administered via subcutaneous injection. \n \nIn paediatric uveitis, there is no experience in the treatment with AMGEVITA without concomitant \ntreatment with methotrexate. \n \nTable 5. AMGEVITA Dose for Paediatric Patients with Uveitis \n \n\nPatient Weight Dosing Regimen \n< 30 kg 20 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate\n\u2265 30 kg 40 mg every other week in combination with \n\nmethotrexate\n \nWhen AMGEVITA therapy is initiated, a loading dose of 40 mg for patients < 30 kg or 80 mg for \npatients \u2265 30 kg may be administered one week prior to the start of maintenance therapy. No clinical \ndata are available on the use of a AMGEVITA loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nThere is no relevant use of AMGEVITA in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nIt is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a \nyearly basis (see section 5.1). \n \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab in children aged 4-17 years have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. There is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this \nindication.  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing spondylitis  \n \nThere is no relevant use of adalimumab in the paediatric population for the indications of ankylosing \nspondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nAMGEVITA is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the \npackage leaflet. \n \n4.3  Contraindications  \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nActive tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nModerate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded.  \n \nInfections  \n \nPatients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function \nmay increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for \ninfections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with AMGEVITA. Because the \nelimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout \nthis period.  \n \nTreatment with AMGEVITA should not be initiated in patients with active infections including \nchronic or localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to \ntuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, \nsuch as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with \nAMGEVITA should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections).  \n \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with AMGEVITA, should be \nmonitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of AMGEVITA \nshould be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate \nantimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians \nshould exercise caution when considering the use of AMGEVITA in patients with a history of \nrecurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, \nincluding the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.  \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSerious infections \n \nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  \n \nTuberculosis \n \nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients \nreceiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) \ntuberculosis. \n \nBefore initiation of therapy with AMGEVITA, all patients must be evaluated for both active or \ninactive (\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment \nof patient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and \nprevious and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin \ntest and chest x-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is \nrecommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. \nPrescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients \nwho are severely ill or immunocompromised.  \n \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, AMGEVITA therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \n \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully \nconsidered.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.  \n \nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis \nprophylaxis treatment before the initiation of AMGEVITA, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations.  \n \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of \nAMGEVITA in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test \nfor tuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate \ncourse of treatment cannot be confirmed.  \n \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in \npatients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active \ntuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.  \n \nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or \nafter therapy with AMGEVITA.  \n \nOther opportunistic infections \n \nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nadalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-\nantagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal \noutcomes.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant \nshock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of AMGEVITA should be \npromptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients \nshould be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive \nfungal infections.  \n \nHepatitis B reactivation  \n \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal \noutcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with AMGEVITA. \nFor patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in \nthe treatment of hepatitis B is recommended.  \n \nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with AMGEVITA should be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination \nof therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in \nconjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients \nwho develop HBV reactivation, AMGEVITA should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with \nappropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  \n \nNeurological events  \n \nTNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating \ndisease, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use \nof AMGEVITA in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders; discontinuation of AMGEVITA should be considered if any of these \ndisorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central \ndemyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious \nintermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of AMGEVITA therapy and regularly during treatment to \nassess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. \n \nAllergic reactions  \n \nSerious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious \nallergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of \nserious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab \nadministration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of \nAMGEVITA should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  \n \nDry natural rubber \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nImmunosuppression  \n \nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no \nevidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or \nchange in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.  \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nIn the controlled portions of adalimumab clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of \nmalignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist \ncompared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases \nof leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased \nbackground risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing \nhighly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current \nknowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in \npatients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.  \n \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated \nwith adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is \nusually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in \nyoung adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for \ninflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or \n6-mercaptopurine and AMGEVITA should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of \nhepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with AMGEVITA cannot be excluded (see \nsection 4.8).  \n \nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom \ntreatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional \ncaution should be exercised in considering AMGEVITA treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).  \n \nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy \nor psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with AMGEVITA. Melanoma and Merkel cell \ncarcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab \n(see section 4.8).  \n \nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients \nwith moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in \nthe lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. \nAll patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any \nTNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking.  \n \nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia \nor colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon \ncarcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing \ncholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for \ndysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation \nshould include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.  \n \nHaematologic reactions  \n \nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to \nseek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias \n\n\n\n14 \n\n(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on AMGEVITA. Discontinuation of \nAMGEVITA therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic \nabnormalities.  \n \nVaccinations  \n \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection \nby live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy.  \n \nPatients on AMGEVITA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. \nAdministration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to AMGEVITA in utero is not \nrecommended for 5 months following the mother\u2019s last AMGEVITA injection during pregnancy. \n \nCongestive heart failure  \n \nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased \nmortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart \nfailure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. AMGEVITA should be used with \ncaution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). AMGEVITA is contraindicated in \nmoderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with AMGEVITA must be discontinued \nin patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.  \n \nAutoimmune processes  \n \nTreatment with AMGEVITA may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of \nlong-term treatment with AMGEVITA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a \npatient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with \nAMGEVITA and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with \nAMGEVITA should not be given (see section 4.8).  \n \nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists  \n \nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-\nantagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of AMGEVITA and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \nConcomitant administration of AMGEVITA with other biologic DMARDS (e.g. anakinra and \nabatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for \ninfections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see \nsection 4.5).  \n \nSurgery  \n \nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The \nlong half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A \npatient who requires surgery while on AMGEVITA should be closely monitored for infections, and \nappropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing \narthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.  \n \n\n\n\n15 \n\nSmall bowel obstruction  \n \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause \nstrictures.  \n \nElderly \n \nThe frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) \nwas higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular \nattention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nSee Vaccinations above. \n \nExcipients with known effects \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  \n \nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and \npsoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant \nmethotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate \nin comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted \nin increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see \nsection 5.1).  \n \nThe combination of AMGEVITA and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d).  \n \nThe combination of AMGEVITA and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d).  \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \n \nWomen of child bearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last AMGEVITA treatment. \n \nPregnancy  \n \nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first \ntrimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. \n \nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) \ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated \nwith adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. \nThe rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 \n(8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA \n(unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with \nCD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The \nadjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD \n\n\n\n16 \n\ncombined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for \nthe secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and \nserious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation \nof data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size \nand non-randomised design. \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3).  \n \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal \nimmune responses in the new born. AMGEVITA should only be used during pregnancy if clearly \nneeded. \n \nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration \nof live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended \nfor 5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.  \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk \nat very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% \nto 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal \nproteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. \nConsequently, AMGEVITA can be used during breastfeeding. \n \nFertility  \n \nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available.  \n \n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  \n \nAMGEVITA may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual \nimpairment may occur following administration of AMGEVITA (see section 4.8).  \n \n4.8  Undesirable effects  \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nAdalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to \n60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long-\nstanding disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-\nrelated arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, \nhidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients \nreceiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled \nperiod.  \n \nThe proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, \ncontrolled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control \ntreated patients.  \n \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper \nrespiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain \nor swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as AMGEVITA \naffect the immune system and their use may affect the body\u2019s defence against infection and cancer.  \n \nFatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV \nreactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been \nreported with use of adalimumab.  \n \nSerious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These \ninclude rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events \nand reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nIn general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in \nadult patients.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on post-\nmarketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in table 6 below: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency \nseen among the various indications has been included.

consistent \nwith the known safety profile of adalimumab. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions  \n \nInjection site reactions  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab \ndeveloped injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared \nto 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not \nnecessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. \n \nInfections  \n \nIn the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in \nthe adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated \npatients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and \nsinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.  \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nThe incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and 0.03 \nper patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled and open-label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections \n(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of \ntuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections \n(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \npneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred \nwithin the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.  \n \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  \n \nNo malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient-years \nduring adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric \npatients with an exposure of 498.1 patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with \nCrohn\u2019s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 \npatient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No \nmalignancies were observed in 60 paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an \nadalimumab trial in paediatric patients with uveitis. \n \nDuring the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in \npatients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis \nsuppurativa, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per \n1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 \npatient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for \nadalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients \nand 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell \ncarcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The rate \n(95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients.  \n \nWhen combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open-label extension \nstudies of adalimumab, with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients \nand over 26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and \nnon-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient-years. The observed rate of non-\nmelanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of \nlymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years.  \n \nIn post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with \nrheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment \nyears. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and \n0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). \n \nRare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated \nwith adalimumab (see section 4.4).  \n \nAutoantibodies  \n \nPatients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis \nstudies I\u2212V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and active \ncontrol-treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at \nweek 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic \n\n\n\n22 \n\narthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients \nimproved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central \nnervous system symptoms. \n \nHepato-biliary events  \n \nIn controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis \nwith a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in \n3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  \n \nIn controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations \n\u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. \nMost ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN \noccurred in the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \nwho were 2 to < 4 years.  \n \nIn controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis with \na control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  \n \nIn the phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy \nand safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted \ninduction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of \npatients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline.  \n \nIn controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period \nduration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-\ntreated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.  \n \nNo ALT elevations \u2265 3 X ULN occurred in the phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with \nplaque psoriasis. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed \nby 40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control \nperiod duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of \nadalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients. \n \nIn controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 \ndays and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations \n\u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. \n \nAcross all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases \nelevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-\nmarketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, \nsuch as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab.  \n \nConcurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine  \n \nIn adult Crohn\u2019s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse \nevents were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared \nwith adalimumab alone.  \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions  \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9  Overdose  \n \nNo dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has \nbeen multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended \ndose.  \n \n \n5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors. \nATC code: L04AB04  \n \nAMGEVITA is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nMechanism of action  \n \nAdalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its \ninteraction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  \n \nAdalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including \nchanges in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, \nand ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  \n \nPharmacodynamic effects  \n \nAfter treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation \n(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was \nobserved, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage \ndestruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab \nusually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.  \n \nA rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic \narthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with \nadalimumab. In patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing \ninflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNF\u03b1 was seen. \nEndoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab-\ntreated patients.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nAdalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The \nefficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled \nstudies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.  \n \n\n\n\n24 \n\nRA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had \ninsufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) \nevery week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, \n40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. \n \nRA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses \nof 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo \non alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same \nduration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed.  \n \nRA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were \n\u2265 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have \nbeen intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first \nreceived placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab \nevery week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with \nplacebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in \nan open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other \nweek up to 10 years. \n \nRA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid \narthritis who were \u2265 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-\nrheumatic drug-na\u00efve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy \nwas stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, \nhydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of \nadalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  \n \nRA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-na\u00efve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early \nrheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every \nother week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate \nof progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 \nweeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was \nadministered every other week up to 10 years. \n \nThe primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the \npercent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA \nstudy V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and \nV had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by \nx-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  \n \nACR response \n \nThe percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent \nacross RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in \ntable 7. \n \nTable 7.

In RA study III, \nthese improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  \n \nIn the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained \nresponse when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. \nAmong those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; \nand 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab \n40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 \npatients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. \n \nIn RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was \nstatistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).  \n \nIn RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 \nresponses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment.  \n \nIn RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate na\u00efve, combination \ntherapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at \nweek 104 (see table 8). \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nTable 8.

Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 170 \npatients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients \n(90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients \n(60.0%) had ACR 70 responses.  \n \nAt week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved \nclinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate \nmonotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate \ncombination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and \nadalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently \ndiagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was \nsimilar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or \nadalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, 171 \nsubjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were \nreported to be in remission at 10 years. \n \nRadiographic response  \n \nIn RA study III, where adalimumab-treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of \napproximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as \nchange in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space \nnarrowing score. Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic \nprogression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see table 9).  \n \nIn the open-label extension of RA study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is \nmaintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated \nwith 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients \nshowed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or \nless. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were \nevaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage \ndefined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nTable 9.

The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, \n23.7% and 36.7% respectively. \n \nQuality of life and physical function  \n \nHealth-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the \nHealth Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, \nwhich was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability \nindex of the HAQ from baseline to month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was \nseen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of \nadalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component \n\n\n\n28 \n\nsummary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the \n40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional \nassessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was \nassessed (RA studies I, III, IV).  \n \nIn RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued \ntreatment maintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. \nImprovement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was \nmaintained through that time. \n \nIn RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 \nshowed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus \nmethotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through \nweek 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in \nphysical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. \n \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with \nactive polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset \ntypes (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended \noligoarthritis).  \n \npJIA-I  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, \nparallel-group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in \nphase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-\ntreated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either na\u00efve to or had been withdrawn from \nMTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of \nNSAIDs and or prednisone (\u2264 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients \nreceived 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. The \ndistribution of patients by age and minimum, median and maximum dose received during the OL LI \nphase is presented in table 11. \n \nTable 11.

Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age \ngroup 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer.  \n \nOverall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with \nthe combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into \nconsideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as \nmonotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). \n \npJIA II \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children \n(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active \npolyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a \nmaximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During \nthe study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or \nNSAIDs. \n \nAt week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed \ndata approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were \n90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded \n(paediatric ACR 30) at week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the paediatric ACR 30 responses were \nmaintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this \ntime period. Overall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. \n \nEnthesitis-related arthritis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study \nin 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were \nrandomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-\nlabel (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of \n40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was \nthe percent change from baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not \ndue to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with \nmean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the adalimumab \ngroup compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. \n\n\n\n30 \n\nImprovement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through \nweek 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. \nAlthough not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in \nsecondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count \n(SJC), paediatric ACR 50 response, and paediatric ACR 70 response. \n \nAxial spondyloarthritis \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) \n \nAdalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline \nscore of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in \nall groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) \npatients were treated concomitantly with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) \npatients with glucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which \npatients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional \n28 weeks. Subjects (n = 215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received \nearly escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently \ntreated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. \n \nIn the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the \nsigns and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to \nplacebo.

Radiographs of hands, wrists, \nand feet were obtained at baseline and week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on \nadalimumab or placebo and at week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified \nTotal Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS \nused for rheumatoid arthritis), was used.  \n \nAdalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with \nplacebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean \u00b1 SD) 0.8 \u00b1 2.5 in the placebo \ngroup (at week 24) compared with 0.0 \u00b1 1.9; (p < 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48). \n \nIn subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 \n(n = 102), 84% continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. \nAdalimumab-treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function \nas assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. \nImproved physical function continued during the open-label extension up to week 136. \n \nPsoriasis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis \n(\u2265 10% BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) \u2265 12 or \u2265 10) who were \ncandidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients \nenrolled in psoriasis studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety \nand efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque \npsoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a \nrandomised double-blind study (psoriasis study III). \n \nPsoriasis study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, \npatients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other \nweek starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least \na PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B \nand received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained \u2265 PASI 75 \nresponse at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in period A, were re-randomised \nin period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. \nAcross all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician\u2019s \nGlobal Assessment (PGA) score ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d (53% of subjects included) to \u201csevere\u201d \n(41%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n \nPsoriasis study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate \nand placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter \ndose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab \nfollowed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are \nno data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving \nMTX who achieved a \u2265 PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. \nAcross all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score \nranged from \u201cmild\u201d (< 1%) to \u201cmoderate\u201d (48%) to \u201csevere\u201d (46%) to \u201cvery severe\u201d (6%). \n \nPatients participating in all phase 2 and phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-\nlabel extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks.  \n \nIn psoriasis studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI \n75 response from baseline at week 16 (see tables 17 and 18). \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nTable 17.

Of the \npatients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-\nlabel extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks \nof retreatment, respectively. \n \nA total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy \nfor 52 weeks in psoriasis study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 \nand PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, \nafter an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all \npatients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, \nwere considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these \npatients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy \n(total of 160 weeks).  \n \nA total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-\nlabel extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a \nmedian time to relapse (decline to PGA \u201cmoderate\u201d or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of \nthese patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of \npatients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d after 16 \nweeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and \n88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, \nrespectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal.  \n \nSignificant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (studies I and II) and MTX \n(study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In study I, improvements \nin the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to \nplacebo. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nIn an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to \n40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients \nachieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. \n \nPsoriasis study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 72 \npatients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients \nreceived an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week \nafter the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater \nproportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands \nand/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). \n \nPsoriasis study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients \nwith moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed \nby 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed \nby open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included \nthe Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment of \nFingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see table 19). \nAdalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin \ninvolvement (BSA \u2265 10% (60% of patients) and BSA < 10% and \u2265 5% (40% of patients)). \n \nTable 19.

After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-\nrandomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab \n40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to \nplacebo in Period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B. \n \nStudy HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients \nreceived placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and \n40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral \nantibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab \nin Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every \nweek, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had \nbeen randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive placebo in Period B. \n \nPatients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension \nstudy in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab \npopulation was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. \n \nClinical response \n \nReduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was \nassessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa clinical response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total \nabscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining \nfistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric \nRating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 \npoint scale.  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\nAt week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo \nachieved HiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in study HS-II experienced \na clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see table 21). Patients treated with adalimumab \nhad significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment.  \n \nTable 21.

Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in \nthe first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group \nexperienced worsening of abscesses (23.0% versus 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% \nversus 13.9%, respectively). \n \nGreater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-\nspecific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; \nStudies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the \nTreatment Satisfaction Questionnaire-medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical \nhealth as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (study HS-I). \n \nIn patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR rate at \nweek 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing \nfrequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see table 22).  \n \nTable 22.

Longer term \ntreatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. \n \nAmong patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, \nthe HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar \nto that observed before withdrawal (56.0%). \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nAdolescent hidradenitis suppurativa \n \nThere are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab \nfor the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and \nexposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, \npathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure \nlevels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on \ncross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more \nfrequent doses (see section 5.2). \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to \nseverely active Crohn\u2019s disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2265 220 and \u2264 450) in \nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, \ncorticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to \nreceive at least one of these medications.  \n \nInduction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD study I \n(CLASSIC I) and CD study II (GAIN). In CD study I, 299 TNF-antagonist na\u00efve patients were \nrandomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nand 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week \n2. In CD study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised \nto receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The \nprimary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further \nevaluated. \n \nMaintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 \npatients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were \nrandomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of \n56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI \u2265 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed \nseparately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week \n8.  \n \nCD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in table 23. \n \nTable 23.

Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to \n\n\n\n40 \n\nother TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in table 24. Clinical \nremission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist exposure.  \n \nDisease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab \ncompared with placebo at week 56. \n \nTable 24.

These results suggest that \nsome patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through \nweek 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see \nsection 4.2).  \n \n117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed \nthrough at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, \ncontinued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and \n233 patients, respectively. \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific \ninflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients \nrandomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 \nand 56 in CD study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo \ngroup. \n \nPaediatric Crohn\u2019s disease  \n \nAdalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to \nevaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body \nweight (< 40 kg or \u2265 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, \nwith moderate to severe Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index \n(PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid \nand/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been \nintolerant to infliximab.  \n \nAll subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their baseline body weight: \n160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects \u2265 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for \nsubjects < 40 kg.  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \nAt week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the low dose \nor standard dose maintenance regimens as shown in table 25. \n \nTable 25.

After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in \nthe study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in \nclinical response per PCDAI. \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with \nmoderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) \nin randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  \n \nIn study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist na\u00efve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at weeks \n0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at week 0 \nfollowed by 40 mg at week 2. After week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg every \nother week. Clinical remission (defined as Mayo score \u2264 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at week \n8.  \n \nIn study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg \nevery other week thereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for \ninduction of remission at week 8 and for maintenance of remission at week 52.  \n \nPatients induced with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at week 8 in \nstatistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% versus 9% respectively, p = 0.031) \nand study UC-II (17% versus 9% respectively, p = 0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with \nadalimumab who were in remission at week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at week 52.  \n \nResults from the overall UC-II study population are shown in table 28. \n \nTable 28.

Among patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, week 52 remission was achieved by \n3% on placebo and 10% on adalimumab.  \n \n\n\n\n43 \n\nPatients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term \nextension study (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in \nclinical remission per partial Mayo score. \n \nHospitalisation rates  \n \nDuring 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related \nhospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The \nnumber of all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year \nversus 0.26 per patient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related \nhospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year versus 0.22 per patient year. \n \nQuality of life  \n \nIn study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score. \n \nUveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious \nintermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two \nrandomised, doublemasked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or \nadalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after \nthe initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. \n \nStudy UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral \nprednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2 week standardised dose of \nprednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete \ncorticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. \n \nStudy UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment \n(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent \na mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. Treatment failure was \ndefined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory \nretinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA). \n \nPatients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term \nextension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on \nstudy medication beyond Week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. \n \nClinical response \n \nResults from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment \nfailure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see table 29). Both \nstudies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus \nplacebo (see figure 2). \n \n\n\n\n44 \n\nTable 29.

In study UV II, statistically significant differences \nwere observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of \nadalimumab. \n \nOf the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 \nsubjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic \nretinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of \nefficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label \nadalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no \nactive inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade \u2264 0.5+, VH grade \u2264 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose \n\u2264 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or \nmaintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond week 78 were \ngenerally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. \nOverall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and \n8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment. \n \nQuality of life \n \nPatient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, \nusing the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with \nstatistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and \ntotal score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. vision related \neffects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UVI and for colour \nvision, peripheral vision and near vision in study UV II. \n \nPaediatric uveitis \n \nThe safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-masked, controlled \nstudy of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious \nanterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received \neither placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if \u2265 30 kg) every other week \nin combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. \n \nThe primary endpoint was \u2018time to treatment failure\u2019. The criteria determining treatment failure were \nworsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with \ndevelopment of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted \nuse of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time. \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \nClinical Response \n \nAdalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (see figure 3, \nP < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects \ntreated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects \ntreated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. \nAdalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown \nby the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]). \n \nFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier curves summarising time to treatment failure in the paediatric uveitis \nstudy \n \n\nPR\nO\n\nB\nA\n\nBI\nL\n\nIT\nY\n\n O\nF \n\nFA\nIL\n\nIN\nG\n\n T\nR\n\nE\nA\n\nTM\nEN\n\nT\n \n\n TIME (WEEKS) \n Treatment Placebo  Adalimumab\n Note: P = Placebo (Number at Risk); H = Adalimumab (Number at Risk). \n\n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nAnti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of anti-\nadalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. \nThere is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the \noccurrence of adverse events.  \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nPaediatric population  \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the \nreference medicinal product containing adalimumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric \npopulation in ulcerative colitis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  \n \nAbsorption and distribution  \n \nAfter subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab \nwas slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The \naverage absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg \nsubcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, \nconcentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg (~40 mg), clearances ranged from \n11 to 15 mL/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 6 litres and the mean terminal phase \nhalf-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from several \nrheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of those in serum.  \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 \u03bcg/mL \n(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 \u03bcg/mL (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. \nThe serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose \nfollowing 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean \ntrough steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was \n5.6 \u00b1 5.6 \u03bcg/mL (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/mL \n(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  \n \nIn patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg \ndosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations \nwas 6.0 \u00b1 6.1 \u00b5g/mL (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 7.9 \u00b1 \n5.6 \u00b5g/mL (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing the administration of 24 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state \n(values measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 \u00b1 6.6 \u00b5g/mL for \nadalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 \u00b1 4.3 \u00b5g/mL with concomitant methotrexate. \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-\nradiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (\u00b1SD) trough steady-state concentration at \nWeek 68 was 8.0 \u00b1 4.6 \uf06dg/ml. \n \nIn adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 \u03bcg/mL during \nadalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.  \n \nFollowing the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other \nweek to paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean \u00b1 SD steady-state adalimumab \ntrough concentration was approximately 7.4 \u00b1 5.8 \u03bcg/mL (79% CV). \n \nIn adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 \u03bcg/mL at \nweek 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.  \n \n\n\n\n48 \n\nAdalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since \nexposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and \ninadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. \n \nIn patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n5.5 \u03bcg/mL during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by \n80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately \n12 \u03bcg/mL during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 \u03bcg/mL \nwere observed in Crohn\u2019s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab \nevery other week. \n \nIn paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was \n160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. \nAt week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg eow) or Low Dose \n(20/10 mg eow) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. The mean (\u00b1SD) serum \nadalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7 \u00b1 6.6 \u03bcg/mL for patients \u2265 40 kg \n(160/80 mg) and 10.6 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcg/mL for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  \n \nFor patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (\u00b1SD) adalimumab trough \nconcentrations at week 52 were 9.5 \u00b1 5.6 \u03bcg/mL for the standard dose group and 3.5 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcg/mL for \nthe low dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to \nreceive adalimumab treatment every other week for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from \nevery other week to weekly regimen, the mean (\u00b1SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 \nwere 15.3 \u00b1 11.4 \u03bcg/mL (40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 \u00b1 3.5 \u03bcg/mL (20/10 mg, weekly).  \n \nIn patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg \nadalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 \u03bcg/mL \nduring the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 \u03bcg/mL were observed \nin ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. \n \nIn adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg \nadalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of \napproximately 8 to 10 \u03bcg/mL. \n \nAdalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic \nmodelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients \n(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, and enthesitis-related \narthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. \nThe predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an \ninitial increase in systemic exposure. \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation \npredicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other \nweek when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, \npatients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients \u2265 40 kg with CD). \n \nExposure-response relationship in paediatric population \n \nOn the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response \nrelationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent \nadalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 \nresponse (EC50) was 3 \u03bcg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 \u03bcg/ml). \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nExposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients \nwith severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, \nrespectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab \nconcentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 \u03bcg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and \n1.9-10.5, respectively). \n \nElimination  \n \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward \nhigher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight \ndifferences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum \nlevels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be \nlower in patients with measurable AAA.  \n \nHepatic or renal impairment  \n \nAdalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data  \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, \nrepeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  \n \nAn embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in \nCynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of \nharm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of \nfertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models \nfor an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising \nantibodies in rodents.  \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again.  \n- Your doctor will also give you a Patient Reminder Card, which contains important safety \n\ninformation that you need to be aware of before you are given AMGEVITA and during \ntreatment with AMGEVITA. Keep this Patient Reminder Card with you.  \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet (see section 4). \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What AMGEVITA is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you use AMGEVITA  \n3. How to use AMGEVITA \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store AMGEVITA  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What AMGEVITA is and what it is used for \n \nAMGEVITA contains the active substance adalimumab.  \n \nAMGEVITA is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n\uf0b7 Rheumatoid arthritis \n\uf0b7 Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\uf0b7 Enthesitis-related arthritis \n\uf0b7 Ankylosing spondylitis \n\uf0b7 Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n\uf0b7 Psoriatic arthritis \n\uf0b7 Plaque psoriasis  \n\uf0b7 Hidradenitis suppurativa \n\uf0b7 Crohn\u2019s disease  \n\uf0b7 Ulcerative colitis \n\uf0b7 Non-infectious uveitis \n \nThe active ingredient in AMGEVITA, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. \nBy attaching to TNF\u03b1, AMGEVITA decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n76 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.  \n \nAMGEVITA can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \nprevious methotrexate treatment. \n \nAMGEVITA slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nto improve physical function.  \n \nUsually, AMGEVITA is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, AMGEVITA can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis  \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years and \nenthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years. You may first be given other disease-modifying \nmedicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven AMGEVITA to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \nmedicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to \nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift \naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the \nbody\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. AMGEVITA is also used \nto treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical \ntherapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \n\n\n\n77 \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner \nthighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nAMGEVITA can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well \nenough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children  \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \nCrohn\u2019s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \nAMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat \n\uf0b7 Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye.  \n\uf0b7 Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting \n\nthe front of the eye. \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black \ndots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). AMGEVITA works by reducing this \ninflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use AMGEVITA \n \nDo not use AMGEVITA: \n \n- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems.  \n\n- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d).  \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AMGEVITA: \n \n- If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more AMGEVITA and contact your doctor immediately since, in \nrare cases, these reactions can be life threatening.  \n\n \n- If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \n\nconsult your doctor before starting AMGEVITA. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n \n\n- You might get infections more easily while you are receiving AMGEVITA treatment. This risk \nmay increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \ndoctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA.  \n\n \n- As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting AMGEVITA. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening \ntests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests \nshould be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who \nhas had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received \npreventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight \nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your \ndoctor immediately.  \n\n \n- Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  \n \n- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections.  \n \n- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. \nAMGEVITA can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \nHBV can be life-threatening.  \n\n \n- If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking AMGEVITA. \n\nYou and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being \ntreated with AMGEVITA. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, \nsuch as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking AMGEVITA. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA. \n \n- If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \n\nif you should receive or continue to receive AMGEVITA. Tell your doctor immediately if you \nexperience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness \nor tingling in any part of your body. \n \n\n- Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving AMGEVITA. \nPlease check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, \n\n\n\n79 \n\nif possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current \nimmunisation guidelines prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy. If you received AMGEVITA \nwhile you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to \napproximately five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that \nyou tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your AMGEVITA use \nduring your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n- If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with AMGEVITA, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor will decide if you should receive AMGEVITA. \n\n \n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n \n\n- There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \nadalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had \nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer \nthat affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone \nmarrow). If you take AMGEVITA the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers \nmay increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in \npatients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with \nAMGEVITA. In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients \ntaking adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions \nchange appearance, tell your doctor. \n \n\n- There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  \n \n\n- On rare occasions, treatment with AMGEVITA could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact \nyour doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nIn order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name \nand the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make \na note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n- Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nAMGEVITA. \n \n- Do not give AMGEVITA to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the \n\nage of 2 years. \n \n\nOther medicines and AMGEVITA  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \n\n\n\n80 \n\nAMGEVITA can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n \nYou should not take AMGEVITA with medicines containing the active substances, anakinra or \nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\uf0b7 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \n\nuse for at least 5 months after the last AMGEVITA treatment. \n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\uf0b7 AMGEVITA should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\uf0b7 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived AMGEVITA during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive AMGEVITA. \n\n\uf0b7 AMGEVITA can be used during breast-feeding. \n\uf0b7 If you receive AMGEVITA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for \n\ngetting an infection. \n\uf0b7 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nAMGEVITA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more \ninformation on vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAMGEVITA may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. Room \nspinning sensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking AMGEVITA. \n \nAMGEVITA contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 mL dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-\nfree\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use AMGEVITA \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nAdults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or axial spondyloarthritis \nwithout radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis  \n \nAMGEVITA is injected under the skin (subcutaneous use). The usual dose for adults with rheumatoid \narthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg given every other week as a single dose.  \n \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is continued while using AMGEVITA.

What AMGEVITA is and what it is used for \n \nAMGEVITA contains the active substance adalimumab.  \n \nAMGEVITA is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: \n\uf0b7 Rheumatoid arthritis \n\uf0b7 Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n\uf0b7 Enthesitis-related arthritis \n\uf0b7 Ankylosing spondylitis \n\uf0b7 Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis \n\uf0b7 Psoriatic arthritis \n\uf0b7 Plaque psoriasis  \n\uf0b7 Hidradenitis suppurativa  \n\uf0b7 Crohn\u2019s disease  \n\uf0b7 Ulcerative colitis \n\uf0b7 Non-infectious uveitis  \n \nThe active ingredient in AMGEVITA, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target.  \n \nThe target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), which is involved in the \nimmune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. \nBy attaching to TNF\u03b1, AMGEVITA decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. \n \n\n\n\n97 \n\nRheumatoid arthritis  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active \nrheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. \nIf you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to treat your \nrheumatoid arthritis.  \n \nAMGEVITA can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without \nprevious methotrexate treatment. \n \nAMGEVITA slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and \nto improve physical function.  \n \nUsually, AMGEVITA is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is \ninappropriate, AMGEVITA can be given alone. \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis \n \nPolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years and \nenthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years. You may first be given other disease-modifying \nmedicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be \ngiven AMGEVITA to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis  \n \nAnkylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing \nspondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic \nevidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial \nspondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other \nmedicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to \nreduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis  \n \nPsoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the \ncartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  \n \nPlaque psoriasis in adults and children \n \nPlaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery \nscales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift \naway from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the \nbody\u2019s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. AMGEVITA is also used \nto treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical \ntherapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. \n \n\n\n\n98 \n\nHidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents \n \nHidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory \nskin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. \nIt most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner \nthighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. \nAMGEVITA can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often \nassociated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well \nenough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA. \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease in adults and children  \n \nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have \nCrohn\u2019s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these \nmedicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn\u2019s disease.  \n \nUlcerative colitis  \n \nUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat ulcerative colitis in adults. If you have ulcerative colitis you will first be \ngiven other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given \nAMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease. \n \nNon-infectious uveitis in adults and children \n \nNon-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  \n \nAMGEVITA is used to treat  \n\uf0b7 Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. \n\uf0b7 Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting \n\nthe front of the eye. \n \nThis inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black \ndots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). AMGEVITA works by reducing this \ninflammation. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use AMGEVITA \n \nDo not use AMGEVITA: \n \n- if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n- if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). \n\nIt is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of infections, e.g. fever, wounds, \nfeeling tired, dental problems.  \n\n- if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or \nhave a serious heart condition (see \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d).  \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AMGEVITA: \n \n- If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, \n\nswelling or rash do not inject more AMGEVITA and contact your doctor immediately since, in \nrare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. \n \n\n- If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) \nconsult your doctor before starting AMGEVITA. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. \n \n\n- You might get infections more easily while you are receiving AMGEVITA treatment. This risk \nmay increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include \ntuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic \ninfections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your \ndoctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor \nmay recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA.  \n\n \n- As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor \n\nwill check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting AMGEVITA. This will \ninclude a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening \ntests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests \nshould be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your \ndoctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who \nhas had tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received \npreventative treatment for tuberculosis. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight \nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your \ndoctor immediately.  \n\n \n- Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as \n\nhistoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  \n \n- Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase \n\nthe risk of infections.  \n \n- Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV \n\nor if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. \nAMGEVITA can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, \nespecially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of \nHBV can be life-threatening.  \n\n \n- If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking AMGEVITA. \n\nYou and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being \ntreated with AMGEVITA. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, \nsuch as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. \n\n \n- If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are \n\ntaking AMGEVITA. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA. \n \n- If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide \n\nif you should receive or continue to receive AMGEVITA. Tell your doctor immediately if you \nexperience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness \nor tingling in any part of your body. \n\n \n- Certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving AMGEVITA. \n\nPlease check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, \n\n\n\n100 \n\nif possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current \nimmunisation guidelines prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy. If you received AMGEVITA \nwhile you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to \napproximately five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. It is important that \nyou tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your AMGEVITA use \nduring your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. \n\n \n- If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with AMGEVITA, your heart failure \n\nstatus must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have \nhad or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart \nfailure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor \nimmediately. Your doctor will decide if you should receive AMGEVITA. \n\n \n- In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body \n\nfight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, \nbruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may \ndecide to stop treatment. \n\n \n- There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking \n\nadalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had \nthe disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer \nthat affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone \nmarrow). If you take AMGEVITA the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers \nmay increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in \npatients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-\nmercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with \nAMGEVITA. In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients \ntaking adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions \nchange appearance, tell your doctor. \n\n \n- There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung \n\ndisease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF \nblocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor \nwhether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  \n \n\n- On rare occasions, treatment with AMGEVITA could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact \nyour doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. \n\n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name \nand the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make \na note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \n- Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using \n\nAMGEVITA. \n \n- Do not give AMGEVITA to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the \n\nage of 2 years.  \n \n\n\n\n101 \n\nOther medicines and AMGEVITA  \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nAMGEVITA can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic \nagents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or \npain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  \n \nYou should not take AMGEVITA with medicines containing the active substances, anakinra or \nabatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \n\uf0b7 You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its \n\nuse for at least 5 months after the last AMGEVITA treatment. \n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice about taking this medicine. \n\uf0b7 AMGEVITA should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. \n\uf0b7 According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had \n\nreceived AMGEVITA during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did \nnot receive AMGEVITA. \n\n\uf0b7 AMGEVITA can be used during breast-feeding. \n\uf0b7 If you receive AMGEVITA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for \n\ngetting an infection. \n\uf0b7 It is important that you tell your baby\u2019s doctors and other health care professionals about your \n\nAMGEVITA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more \ninformation on vaccines see the \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d section. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nAMGEVITA may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines.

Part of the \nAMGEVITA pre-filled pen may be broken even if you cannot see the break. Use a new \nAMGEVITA pre-filled pen. \n\n\u25cf The needle cover of the AMGEVITA pre-filled pen is made from dry natural rubber, which \ncontains latex. Tell your healthcare provider if you are allergic to latex.\n\n \nStep 1: Prepare\n\n \n\nA. Remove one AMGEVITA pre-filled pen from the package.\nCarefully lift the pre-filled pen straight up out of the box. \n \nPut the original package with any unused pre-filled pens back in the refrigerator. \n \nFor a more comfortable injection, leave the pre-filled pen at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes \nbefore injecting. \n \n\u25cf Do not put the pre-filled pen back in the refrigerator once it has reached room temperature.\n\u25cf Do not try to warm the pre-filled pen by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave.\n\u25cf Do not shake the pre-filled pen. \n\u25cf Do not remove the yellow cap from the pre-filled pen yet.\n\n \nB. Inspect the AMGEVITA pre-filled pen.\n\nYellow cap on Window Medicine\n \n\nMake sure the medicine in the window is clear and colourless to slightly yellow. \n \n\u25cf Do not use the pre-filled pen if: \n - The medicine is cloudy or discoloured, or contains flakes or particles. \n\n- Any part appears cracked or broken. \n- The pre-filled pen has been dropped on a hard surface. \n- The yellow cap is missing or not securely attached. \n- The expiration date printed on the label has passed.\n\nIn all cases, use a new pre-filled pen. \n \n\n\n\n113 \n\nC. Gather all materials needed for your injection. \nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. \nOn a clean, well-lit work surface, place a new, pre-filled pen. \n \nYou will also need these additional items, as they are not included in the carton: \n\u25cf Alcohol wipes \n\u25cf Cotton ball or gauze pad \n\u25cf Plaster \n\u25cf Sharps disposal container \n\n \n\n \n\n \nD. Prepare and clean your injection site.\n\nBelly \n\nThigh \n\n \n\nYou can use: \n\n\u25cf Your thigh \n\u25cf Belly, except for a 2-inch (5 centimetre) area right around your belly button \n \nClean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. \n\u25cf Do not touch this area again before injecting. \n\u25cf If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection \n\nsite you used for a previous injection. \n - Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting \n\ninto areas with scars or stretch marks.\n\u25cf If you have psoriasis, you should avoid injecting directly into raised, thick, red, or scaly skin \n\npatch or lesion. \n \n\n\n\n114 \n\nStep 2: Get ready\n \nE. Pull the yellow cap straight off when you are ready to inject.\n\n \n\nIt is normal to see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle or yellow safety guard. \n\u25cf Do not twist or bend the yellow cap.\n\u25cf Do not put the yellow cap back onto the pre-filled pen.\n\u25cf Do not remove the yellow cap from the pre-filled pen until you are ready to inject. \n\n \nF. Stretch or pinch your injection site to create a firm surface.\nStretch method \n\n \n\nStretch the skin firmly by moving your thumb and fingers in opposite directions, creating an area \nabout 2 inches (5 centimetres) wide. \n\nOR \nPinch method \n\nPinch the skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, creating an area about 2 inches (5 \ncentimetres) wide. \nImportant: Keep the skin stretched or pinched while injecting.\n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\nStep 3: Inject\n \n\nG. Hold the stretch or pinch. With the yellow cap off, place the pre-filled pen on your skin at \n90 degrees. \n\n \n\nImportant: Do not touch the blue start button yet. \n \nH. Firmly push the pre-filled pen down onto the skin until it stops moving. \n\n \n\nPush down \n\n \n\nImportant: You must push all the way down but do not touch the blue start button until you are \nready to inject. \n\n \nI. When you are ready to inject, press the blue start button. You will hear a click. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cClick\u201d \n\n\n\n116 \n\nJ. Keep pushing down on your skin. Your injection could take about 10 seconds. \n\n  \n\n~10s  \n\n \n\n \nThe window turns yellow when \nthe injection is done. \nYou may hear a second click. \n\n \n\nNote: After you remove the pre-filled pen from your  \nskin, the needle will be automatically covered. \n\nImportant: When you remove the pre-filled pen, if the window has not turned yellow, or if it looks \nlike the medicine is still injecting, this means you have not received a full dose. Call your doctor \nimmediately. \n\n \n\n\u201cClick\u201d \n\n\n\n117 \n\nStep 4: Finish\n \nK. Discard the used pre-filled pen and the yellow cap.\n\n \n\n\u25cf Put the used pre-filled pen in a sharps disposal container immediately after use. Do not throw \naway (dispose of) the pre-filled pen in your household waste.\n\n\u25cf Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about proper disposal. There may be local guidelines for \ndisposal. \n\n\u25cf Do not reuse the pre-filled pen. \n\u25cf Do not recycle the pre-filled pen or sharps disposal container or throw them into the household \n\nwaste. \nImportant: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \nL. Examine the injection site. \nIf there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. \nApply a plaster if needed. \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition (see \"warnings and precautions\"). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using amgevita: - if you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, swelling or rash do not inject more amgevita and contact your doctor immediately since, in rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. - if you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) consult your doctor before starting amgevita. if you are unsure, contact your doctor. - you might get infections more easily while you are receiving amgevita treatment. this risk may increase if your lung function is impaired. these infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. it is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of amgevita. - as cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting amgevita. this will include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). the conduct and results of these tests should be recorded on your patient reminder card. it is very important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis. tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for tuberculosis. if symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately. - advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as histoplasmosis coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic. - advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase the risk of infections. - advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis b virus (hbv), if you have active hbv or if you think you might be at risk of contracting hbv. your doctor should test you for hbv. amgevita can cause reactivation of hbv in people who carry this virus. in some rare cases, especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of hbv can be life-threatening. - if you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking amgevita. you and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being treated with amgevita. it is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. - if you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are taking amgevita. your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of amgevita. - if you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide if you should receive or continue to receive amgevita. tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness or tingling in any part of your body. - certain vaccines may cause infections and should not be given while receiving amgevita. please check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. it is recommended that children, 79 if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating amgevita therapy. if you received amgevita while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last dose you received during pregnancy. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your amgevita use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. - if you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with amgevita, your heart failure status must be closely monitored by your doctor. it is important to tell your doctor if you have had or have a serious heart condition. if you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor immediately. your doctor will decide if you should receive amgevita. - in some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body fight infections or help you to stop bleeding. if you develop a fever that does not go away, bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. your doctor may decide to stop treatment. - there have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking adalimumab or other tnf blockers. people with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow). if you take amgevita the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may increase. on rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking adalimumab. some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine. tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with amgevita. in addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking adalimumab. if new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. - there have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) treated with another tnf blocker. if you have copd, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a tnf blocker is appropriate for you. - on rare occasions, treatment with amgevita could result in lupus-like syndrome. contact your doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. in order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. you may also wish to make a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. children and adolescents - vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using amgevita. - do not give amgevita to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the age of 2 years. other medicines and amgevita tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. amgevita can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). you should not take amgevita with medicines containing the active substances, anakinra or abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. if you have questions, please ask your doctor. pregnancy and breast-feeding you should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last amgevita treatment. if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice about taking this medicine. amgevita should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. according to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had received amgevita during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did not receive amgevita. amgevita can be used during breast-feeding. if you receive amgevita during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for getting an infection. it is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care professionals about your amgevita use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. for more information on vaccines see the \"warnings and precautions\" section. driving and using machines amgevita may have a minor influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. room spinning sensation and vision disturbances may occur after taking amgevita. amgevita contains sodium this medicine contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, i.e. essentially 'sodium-
