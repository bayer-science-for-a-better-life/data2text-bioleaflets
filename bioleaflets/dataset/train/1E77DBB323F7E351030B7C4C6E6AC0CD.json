CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nCapecitabine medac is indicated:  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\u2022 for the adjuvant treatment of patients following surgery of stage III (Dukes\u2019 stage C) colon \ncancer (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\u2022 for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (see section 5.1). \n \n\u2022 for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer in combination with a platinum based regimen \n\n(see section 5.1). \n \n\u2022 in combination with docetaxel (see section 5.1) for the treatment of patients with locally \n\nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Previous therapy \nshould have included an anthracycline. \n\n \n\u2022 as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer \n\nafter failure of taxanes and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen or for whom \nfurther anthracycline therapy is not indicated. \n\n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nCapecitabine medac should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in the utilisation \nof anti-neoplastic medicinal products. Careful monitoring during the first cycle of treatment is \nrecommended for all patients. \n \nTreatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable toxicity is observed. Standard \nand reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for starting doses of Capecitabine medac \nof 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 and 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 are provided in tables 1 and 2, respectively. \n \nPosology \nRecommended posology (see section 5.1): \n \nMonotherapy \nColon, colorectal and breast cancer \nGiven as monotherapy, the recommended starting dose for capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of \ncolon cancer, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or of locally advanced or metastatic \nbreast cancer is 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 administered twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to \n2,500 mg/m\u00b2 total daily dose) for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Adjuvant treatment in \npatients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months. \n \nCombination therapy \nColon, colorectal and gastric cancer \nIn combination treatment, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine should be reduced to \n800-1,000 mg/m\u00b2 when administered twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, or to \n625 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily when administered continuously (see section 5.1). For combination with \nirinotecan, the recommended starting dose is 800 mg/m\u00b2 when administered twice daily for 14 days \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period combined with irinotecan 200 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1. The inclusion of \nbevacizumab in a combination regimen has no effect on the starting dose of capecitabine. \nPremedication to maintain adequate hydration and anti-emesis according to the cisplatin summary of \nproduct characteristics should be started prior to cisplatin administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus cisplatin combination. Premedication with antiemetics according to the oxaliplatin \nsummary of product characteristics is recommended for patients receiving the capecitabine plus \noxaliplatin combination.Adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for \na duration of 6 months. \n \nBreast cancer \nIn combination with docetaxel, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine in the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer is 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, \ncombined with docetaxel at 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Pre-medication \n\n\n\n4 \n\nwith an oral corticosteroid such as dexamethasone according to the docetaxel summary of product \ncharacteristics should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the \ncapecitabine plus docetaxel combination. \n \nCapecitabine medac dose calculations \n \nTable 1 Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose of \n\ncapecitabine of 1,250 mg/m\u00b2. \n Dose level 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 (twice daily) \n Full dose \n\n \n \n\n1,250 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg tablets, \n300 mg tablets and/or \n\n500 mg tablets per \nadministration (each \n\nadministration to be given \nmorning and evening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75 %) \n\n \n950 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50 %) \n\n \n625 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nBody surface area \n(m\u00b2) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n150 mg 300 mg 500 mg \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\u2264 1.26 1,500 - - 3 1,150 800 \n1.27 - 1.38 1,650 1 - 3 1,300 800 \n1.39 - 1.52 1,800 - 1 3 1,450 950 \n1.53 - 1.66 2,000 - - 4 1,500 1,000 \n1.67 - 1.78 2,150 1 - 4 1,650 1,000 \n1.79 - 1.92 2,300 - 1 4 1,800 1,150 \n1.93 - 2.06 2,500 - - 5 1,950 1,300 \n2.07 - 2.18 2,650 1 - 5 2,000 1,300 \n\u2265 2.19 2,800 - 1 5 2,150 1,450 \n \nTable 2 Standard and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for a starting dose of \n\ncapecitabine of 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 \n Dose level 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 (twice daily) \n Full dose \n\n \n \n\n1,000 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nNumber of 150 mg tablets, \n300 mg tablets and/or 500 mg \n\ntablets per administration \n(each administration to be \n\ngiven morning and evening) \n\nReduced dose \n(75 %) \n\n \n750 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nReduced dose \n(50 %) \n\n \n500 mg/m\u00b2 \n\nBody surface \narea (m\u00b2) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n150 mg 300 mg 500 mg \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\nDose per \nadministration \n\n(mg) \n\u22641.26 1,150 1 - 2 800 600 \n1.27 - 1.38 1,300 - 1 2 1,000 600 \n1.39 - 1.52 1,450 1 1 2 1,100 750 \n1.53 - 1.66 1,600 - 2 2 1,200 800 \n1.67 - 1.78 1,750 1 2 2 1,300 800 \n1.79 - 1.92 1,800 - 1 3 1,400 900 \n1.93 - 2.06 2,000 - - 4 1,500 1,000 \n2.07 - 2.18 2,150 1 - 4 1,600 1,050 \n\u2265 2.19 2,300 - 1 4 1,750 1,100 \n \nPosology adjustments during treatment \n \nGeneral \nToxicity due to capecitabine administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment and/or \nmodification of the dose (treatment interruption or dose reduction). Once the dose has been reduced, it \n\n\n\n5 \n\nshould not be increased at a later time. For those toxicities considered by the treating physician to be \nunlikely to become serious or life-threatening, e.g. alopecia, altered taste, nail changes, treatment can \nbe continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption. Patients taking capecitabine should be \ninformed of the need to interrupt treatment immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs. Doses \nof capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced.

For hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and \nhyperbilirubinaemia, see section 4.4. \n \nHaematology \nPatients with baseline neutrophil counts of < 1.5 x 109/L and/or thrombocyte counts of < 100 x 109/L \nshould not be treated with capecitabine. If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a treatment \ncycle show that the neutrophil count drops below 1.0 x 109/L or that the platelet count drops below \n75 x 109/L treatment with capecitabine should be interrupted. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3-weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3-weekly cycle in combination with \nother medicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to \nthe appropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nAt the beginning of a treatment cycle, if a treatment delay is indicated for either capecitabine or the \nother medicinal product(s), then administration of all therapy should be delayed until the requirements \nfor restarting all medicinal products are met. \n \nDuring a treatment cycle for those toxicities considered by the treating physician not to be related to \ncapecitabine, capecitabine should be continued and the dose of the other medicinal product should be \nadjusted according to the appropriate Prescribing Information. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \nIf the other medicinal product(s) have to be discontinued permanently, capecitabine treatment can be \nresumed when the requirements for restarting capecitabine are met. \n \nThis advice is applicable to all indications and to all special populations. \n \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products \nDose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other \nmedicinal products should be made according to table 3 above for capecitabine and according to the \nappropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). \n \nPosology adjustments for special populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nInsufficient safety and efficacy data are available in patients with hepatic impairment to provide a dose \nadjustment recommendation. No information is available on hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis or \nhepatitis. \n \nRenal impairment \nCapecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below \n30 ml/min [Cockcroft and Gault] at baseline). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 - 50 ml/min at baseline) is increased \ncompared to the overall population. In patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, a dose \nreduction to 75 % for a starting dose of 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 is recommended. In patients with moderate renal \nimpairment at baseline, no dose reduction is required for a starting dose of 1,000 mg/m\u00b2. In patients \nwith mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51 - 80 ml/min at baseline) no adjustment of the \nstarting dose is recommended. Careful monitoring and prompt treatment interruption is recommended \nif the patient develops a grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse event during treatment and subsequent dose \nadjustment as outlined in table 3 above. If the calculated creatinine clearance decreases during \ntreatment to a value below 30 ml/min, Capecitabine medac should be discontinued. These dose \nadjustment recommendations for renal impairment apply both to monotherapy and combination use \n(see also section \u201cElderly\u201d below). \n \nElderly \nDuring capecitabine monotherapy, no adjustment of the starting dose is needed. However, grade 3 or 4 \ntreatment-related adverse reactions were more frequent in patients \u2265 60 years of age compared to \nyounger patients. \n \nWhen capecitabine was used in combination with other medicinal products, elderly patients (\u2265 65 \nyears) experienced more grade 3 and grade 4 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including those leading \nto discontinuation, compared to younger patients. Careful monitoring of patients \u2265 60 years of age is \nadvisable. \n- In combination with docetaxel: an increased incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse \n\nreactions and treatment-related serious adverse reactions were observed in patients 60 years of \nage or more (see section 5.1). For patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of \ncapecitabine to 75 % (950 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily) is recommended. If no toxicity is observed in \npatients \u2265 60 years of age treated with a reduced capecitabine starting dose in combination with \ndocetaxel, the dose of capecitabine may be cautiously escalated to 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily. \n\n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Capecitabine medac in the paediatric population in the indications colon, \ncolorectal, gastric and breast cancer. \n \nMethod of administration \nCapecitabine medac tablets should be swallowed whole with water within 30 minutes after a meal. \n\n\n\n7 \n\nCapecitabine medac tablets should not be crushed or cut. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy, \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or \n\nfluorouracil, \n\u2022 Known complete dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4), \n\u2022 During pregnancy and lactation, \n\u2022 In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, \n\u2022 In patients with severe hepatic impairment, \n\u2022 In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min), \n\u2022 Recent or concomitant treatment with brivudine (see section 4.4 and 4.5 for drug drug \n\ninteraction), \n\u2022 If contraindications exist to any of the medicinal products in the combination regimen, that \n\nmedicinal product should not be used. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDose limiting toxicities  \nDose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome \n(HFS, hand-foot skin reaction, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Most adverse reactions are \nreversible and do not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be \nwithheld or reduced. \n \nDiarrhoea  \nPatients with severe diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte \nreplacement if they become dehydrated. Standard antidiarrhoeal treatments (e.g. loperamide) may be \nused. NCIC CTC grade 2 diarrhoea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools, \ngrade 3 diarrhoea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption. Grade 4 \ndiarrhoea is an increase of \u2265 10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhoea or the need for parenteral \nsupport. Dose reduction should be applied as necessary (see section 4.2). \n \nDehydration  \nDehydration should be prevented or corrected at the onset. Patients with anorexia, asthenia, nausea, \nvomiting or diarrhoea may rapidly become dehydrated. Dehydration may cause acute renal failure, \nespecially in patients with pre-existing compromised renal function or when capecitabine is given \nconcomitantly with known nephrotoxic medicinal products. Acute renal failure secondary to \ndehydration might be potentially fatal. If grade 2 (or higher) dehydration occurs, capecitabine \ntreatment should be immediately interrupted and the dehydration corrected. Treatment should not be \nrestarted until the patient is rehydrated and any precipitating causes have been corrected or controlled. \nDose modifications applied should be applied for the precipitating adverse event as necessary (see \nsection 4.2). \n \nHand--foot syndrome  \nHFS also known as hand-foot skin reaction or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy \ninduced acral erythema. Grade 1 HFS is defined as numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, \npainless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort which does not disrupt the \npatient\u2019s normal activities. \nGrade 2 HFS is painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the \npatient\u2019s activities of daily living. \nGrade 3 HFS is moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands and/or feet \nand/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily \nliving. Persistent or severe HFS (Grade 2 and above) can eventually lead to loss of fingerprints which \ncould impact patient identification. If grade 2 or 3 HFS occurs, administration of capecitabine should \n\n\n\n8 \n\nbe interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 HFS, \nsubsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. When capecitabine and cisplatin are used in \ncombination, the use of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is not advised for symptomatic or secondary \nprophylactic treatment of HFS, because of published reports that it may decrease the efficacy of \ncisplatin. There is some evidence that dexpanthenol is effective for HFS prophylaxis in patients treated \nwith capecitabine. \n \nCardiotoxicity  \nCardiotoxicity has been associated with fluoropyrimidine therapy, including myocardial infarction, \nangina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and electrocardiographic changes (including \nvery rare cases of QT prolongation). These adverse reactions may be more common in patients with a \nprior history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation, torsade \nde pointes, and bradycardia), angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiomyopathy \nhave been reported in patients receiving capecitabine. Caution must be exercised in patients with \nhistory of significant cardiac disease, arrhythmias and angina pectoris (see section 4.8). \n \nHypo- or hypercalcaemia  \nHypo- or hypercalcaemia has been reported during capecitabine treatment. Caution must be exercised \nin patients with pre-existing hypo- or hypercalcaemia (see section 4.8). \n \nCentral or peripheral nervous system disease  \nCaution must be exercised in patients with central or peripheral nervous system disease, e.g. brain \nmetastasis or neuropathy (see section 4.8). \n \nDiabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances  \nCaution must be exercised in patients with diabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances, as these may \nbe aggravated during capecitabine treatment. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulation  \nIn an interaction study with single-dose warfarin administration, there was a significant increase in the \nmean AUC (+57 %) of S-warfarin. These results suggest an interaction, probably due to an inhibition \nof the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system by capecitabine. Patients receiving concomitant \ncapecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant \nresponse (International Normalised Ratio [INR] or prothrombin time) monitored closely and the \nanticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see section 4.5). \n \nBrivudine \nBrivudine must not be administered concomitantly with capecitabine. Fatal cases have been reported \nfollowing this drug interaction. There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end of \ntreatment with brivudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started \n24 hours after the last dose of capecitabine (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \nIn the event of accidental administration of brivudine to patients being treated with capecitabine, \neffective measures should be taken to reduce the toxicity of capecitabine. Immediate admission to \nhospital is recommended. All measures should be initiated to prevent systemic infections and \ndehydration. \n \nHepatic impairment  \nIn the absence of safety and efficacy data in patients with hepatic impairment, capecitabine use should \nbe carefully monitored in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, regardless of the presence \nor absence of liver metastasis. Administration of capecitabine should be interrupted if \ntreatment-related elevations in bilirubin of > 3.0 x ULN or treatment-related elevations in hepatic \naminotransferases (ALT, AST) of > 2.5 x ULN occur. Treatment with capecitabine monotherapy may \nbe resumed when bilirubin decreases to \u2264 3.0 x ULN or hepatic aminotransferases decrease to \n\u2264 2.5 x ULN. \n \nRenal impairment  \n\n\n\n9 \n\nThe incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 30 - 50 ml/min) is increased compared to the overall population (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). \n \nDihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency  \n \nDPD activity is rate limiting in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (see section 5.2). Patients with DPD \ndeficiency are therefore at increased risk of fluoropyrimidines-related toxicity, including for example \nstomatitis, diarrhoea, mucosal inflammation, neutropenia and neurotoxicity.  \n \nDPD-deficiency related toxicity usually occurs during the first cycle of treatment or after dose \nincrease.  \n \nComplete DPD deficiency  \nComplete DPD deficiency is rare (0.01-0.5% of Caucasians). Patients with complete DPD deficiency \nare at high risk of life-threatening or fatal toxicity and must not be treated with Capecitabine medac \n(see section 4.3).  \n \nPartial DPD deficiency  \nPartial DPD deficiency is estimated to affect 3-9% of the Caucasian population. Patients with partial \nDPD deficiency are at increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity. A reduced \nstarting dose should be considered to limit this toxicity. DPD deficiency should be considered as a \nparameter to be taken into account in conjunction with other routine measures for dose reduction. \nInitial dose reduction may impact the efficacy of treatment. In the absence of serious toxicity, \nsubsequent doses may be increased with careful monitoring.  \n \nTesting for DPD deficiency  \nPhenotype and/or genotype testing prior to the initiation of treatment with Capecitabine medac is \nrecommended despite uncertainties regarding optimal pre-treatment testing methodologies. \nConsideration should be given to applicable clinical guidelines.  \n \nGenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency  \nPre-treatment testing for rare mutations of the DPYD gene can identify patients with DPD deficiency.  \n \nThe four DPYD variants c.1905+1G>A [also known as DPYD*2A], c.1679T>G [DPYD*13], \nc.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3 can cause complete absence or reduction of DPD enzymatic \nactivity. Other rare variants may also be associated with an increased risk of severe or life-threatening \ntoxicity. \n \nCertain homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the DPYD gene locus (e.g. \ncombinations of the four variants with at least one allele of c.1905+1G>A or c.1679T>G) are known \nto cause complete or near complete absence of DPD enzymatic activity.  \n \nPatients with certain heterozygous DPYD variants (including c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T \nand c.1236G>A/HapB3) have increased risk of severe toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidines.  \n \nThe frequency of the heterozygous c.1905+1G>A genotype in the DPYD gene in Caucasian patients is \naround 1%, 1.1% for c.2846A>T, 2.6-6.3% for c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants and 0.07 to 0.1% for \nc.1679T>G.  \n \nData on the frequency of the four DPYD variants in other populations than Caucasian is limited. At \nthe present, the four DPYD variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3) \nare considered virtually absent in populations of African (-American) or Asian origin. \n \nPhenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency  \nFor phenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency, the measurement of pre-therapeutic blood levels \nof the endogenous DPD substrate uracil (U) in plasma is recommended.  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \nElevated pre-treatment uracil concentrations are associated with an increased risk of toxicity. Despite \nuncertainties on uracil thresholds defining complete and partial DPD deficiency, a blood uracil level \n\u2265 16 ng/ml and < 150 ng/ml should be considered indicative of partial DPD deficiency and associated \nwith an increased risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity. A blood uracil level \u2265 150 ng/ml should be \nconsidered indicative of complete DPD deficiency and associated with a risk for life-threatening or \nfatal fluoropyrimidine toxicity. \n \nOphthalmologic complications  \nPatients should be carefully monitored for ophthalmological complications such as keratitis and \ncorneal disorders, especially if they have a prior history of eye disorders. Treatment of eye disorders \nshould be initiated as clinically appropriate. \n \nSevere skin reactions  \nCapecitabine can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic \nEpidermal Necrolysis. Capecitabine should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a \nsevere skin reaction during treatment. \n \nExcipients \nAs this medicinal product contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient, patients with rare hereditary \nproblems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption \nshould not take this medicine. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nCapecitabine medac tablets should not be crushed or cut. In case of exposure of either patient or \ncaregiver to crushed or cut Capecitabine medac tablets adverse drug reactions could occur (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nInteraction with other medicinal products \n \nBrivudine  \nA clinically significant interaction between brivudine and fluoropyrimidines (e.g. capecitabine, \n5-fluorouracil, tegafur), resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase by \nbrivudine, has been described. This interaction, which leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is \npotentially fatal. Therefore, brivudine must not be administered concomitantly with capecitabine  (see \nsection 4.3 and 4.4). There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end of treatment with \nbrivudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started 24 hours after the \nlast dose of capecitabine. \n \nCytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates  \nOther than warfarin, no formal interaction studies between capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates \nhave been conducted. Care should be exercised when capecitabine is co-administered with 2C9 \nsubstrates (e.g. phenytoin). See also interaction with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants below, and \nsection 4.4. \n \nCoumarin-derivative anticoagulants  \nAltered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking capecitabine \nconcomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. These \nreactions occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy \nand, in a few cases, within one month after stopping capecitabine. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nIn a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study, after a single 20 mg dose of warfarin, capecitabine \ntreatment increased the AUC of S-warfarin by 57 % with a 91 % increase in INR value. Since \nmetabolism of R-warfarin was not affected, these results indicate that capecitabine down-regulates \nisozyme 2C9, but has no effect on isozymes 1A2 and 3A4. Patients taking coumarin-derivative \nanticoagulants concomitantly with capecitabine should be monitored regularly for alterations in their \ncoagulation parameters (PT or INR) and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly. \n \nPhenytoin  \nIncreased phenytoin plasma concentrations resulting in symptoms of phenytoin intoxication in single \ncases have been reported during concomitant use of capecitabine with phenytoin. Patients taking \nphenytoin concomitantly with capecitabine should be regularly monitored for increased phenytoin \nplasma concentrations. \n \nFolinic acid/folic acid  \nA combination study with capecitabine and folinic acid indicated that folinic acid has no major effect \non the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. However, folinic acid has an effect on the \npharmacodynamics of capecitabine and its toxicity may be enhanced by folinic acid: the maximum \ntolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3,000 mg/m\u00b2 per day \nwhereas it is only 2,000 mg/m\u00b2 per day when capecitabine was combined with folinic acid (30 mg \norally bid). The enhanced toxicity may be relevant when switching from 5-FU/LV to a capecitabine \nregimen. This may also be relevant with folic acid supplementation for folate deficiency due to the \nsimilarity between folinic acid and folic acid. \n \nAntacid  \nThe effect of an aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid on the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated. There was a small increase in plasma \nconcentrations of capecitabine and one metabolite 5\u2019-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5\u2019-DFCR); there was no \neffect on the 3 major metabolites: 5\u2019-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5\u2019-DFUR), 5-FU and \u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-alanine \n(FBAL). \n \nAllopurinol  \nInteractions with allopurinol have been observed for 5-FU; with possible decreased efficacy of 5-FU. \nConcomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine should be avoided. \n \nInterferon alpha  \nThe MTD of capecitabine was 2,000 mg/m\u00b2 per day when combined with interferon alpha- 2a \n(3 MIU/m\u00b2 per day) compared to 3,000 mg/m\u00b2 per day when capecitabine was used alone. \n \nRadiotherapy  \nThe MTD of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3,000 mg/m\u00b2 per day, whereas, when \ncombined with radiotherapy for rectal cancer, the MTD of capecitabine is 2,000 mg/m\u00b2 per day using \neither a continuous schedule or given daily Monday through Friday during a 6-week course of \nradiotherapy. \n \nOxaliplatin  \nNo clinically significant differences in exposure to capecitabine or its metabolites, free platinum or \ntotal platinum occurred when capecitabine was administered in combination with oxaliplatin or in \ncombination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. \n \nBevacizumab  \nThere was no clinically significant effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetic parameters of \ncapecitabine or its metabolites in the presence of oxaliplatin. \n \nFood interaction \n\n\n\n12 \n\nIn all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. \nSince current safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that \ncapecitabine be administered with food. Administration with food decreases the rate of capecitabine \nabsorption (see section 5.2). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving \ntreatment with capecitabine. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving capecitabine, the \npotential hazard to the foetus must be explained. An effective method of contraception should be used \nduring treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of capecitabine. \nBased on genetic toxicity findings, male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should \nuse effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of capecitabine. \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no studies in pregnant women using capecitabine; however, it should be assumed that \ncapecitabine may cause foetal harm if administered to pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity \nstudies in animals, capecitabine administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity. These \nfindings are expected effects of fluoropyrimidine derivatives. Capecitabine is contraindicated during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether capecitabine is excreted in human breast milk. No studies have been \nconducted to assess the impact of capecitabine on milk production or its presence in human breast \nmilk. In lactating mice, considerable amounts of capecitabine and its metabolites were found in milk. \nAs the potential for harm to the nursing infant is unknown, breast-feeding should be discontinued \nwhile receiving treatment with capecitabine and for 2 weeks after the final dose. \n \nFertility \nThere is no data on capecitabine and impact on fertility. The capecitabine pivotal studies included \nfemales of childbearing potential and males only if they agreed to use an acceptable method of birth \ncontrol to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a reasonable period thereafter. \nIn animal studies effects on fertility were observed (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nCapecitabine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Capecitabine \nmay cause dizziness, fatigue and nausea. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe overall safety profile of capecitabine is based on data from over 3,000 patients treated with \ncapecitabine as monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in \nmultiple indications. The safety profiles of capecitabine monotherapy for the metastatic breast cancer, \nmetastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant colon cancer populations are comparable. See section 5.1 for \ndetails of major studies, including study designs and major efficacy results. \n \nThe most commonly reported and/or clinically relevant treatment-related ADRs were gastrointestinal \ndisorders (especially diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, stomatitis), HFS (palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia), fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, cardiotoxicity, increased renal dysfunction on those \nwith pre-existing compromised renal function, and thrombosis/embolism. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nADRs considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or remotely related to the \nadministration of capecitabine are listed in table 4 for capecitabine given as monotherapy and in \ntable 5 for capecitabine given in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications. The following headings are used to rank the ADRs by frequency: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very \nrare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing \nseriousness. \n \nCapecitabine monotherapy \nTable 4 lists ADRs associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis of \nsafety data from three major studies including over 1,900 patients (studies M66001, SO14695, and \nSO14796). ADRs are added to the appropriate frequency grouping according to the overall incidence \nfrom the pooled analysis. \n \nTable 4 Summary of related ADRs reported in patients treated with capecitabine monotherapy \nBody system Very  \n\ncommon \n \n\nAll grades \n\nCommon \n \n\nAll grades \n\nUncommon \n \n\nSevere and/or \nlife-threatening \n(grade 3 -

ADRs are added according to the highest incidence seen in any \nof the major combination trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHFS (see section 4.4) \nFor the capecitabine dose of 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks, a frequency of \n53 % to 60 % of all-grades HFS was observed in capecitabine monotherapy trials (comprising studies \nin adjuvant therapy in colon cancer, treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and treatment of breast \ncancer) and a frequency of 63 % was observed in the capecitabine/docetaxel arm for the treatment of \nmetastatic breast cancer. For the capecitabine dose of 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every \n3 weeks, a frequency of 22 % to 30 % of all-grade HFS was observed in capecitabine combination \ntherapy. \n \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4,700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that HFS (all grades) occurred in \n2,066 (43 %) patients after a median time of 239 [95 % CI 201, 288] days after starting treatment with \n\n\n\n18 \n\ncapecitabine. In all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically significantly \nassociated with an increased risk of developing HFS: increasing capecitabine starting dose (gram), \ndecreasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg), increasing relative dose intensity in the first six \nweeks, increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year increments), female \ngender, and good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status at baseline (0 \nversus \u2265 1). \n \nDiarrhoea (see section 4.4) \nCapecitabine can induce the occurrence of diarrhoea, which has been observed in up to 50 % of \npatients. \n \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4,700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically \nsignificantly associated with an increased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing capecitabine \nstarting dose (gram), increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year \nincrements), and female gender. The following covariates were statistically significantly associated \nwith a decreased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg) and \nincreasing relative dose intensity in the first six weeks. \n \nCardiotoxicity (see section 4.4) \nIn addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, the following ADRs with an incidence of less than \n0.1 % were associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis from \nclinical safety data from 7 clinical trials including 949 patients (2 phase III and 5 phase II clinical trials \nin metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic breast cancer): cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, sudden \ndeath, and ventricular extrasystoles. \n \nEncephalopathy \nIn addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, and based on the above pooled analysis from \nclinical safety data from 7 clinical trials, encephalopathy was also associated with the use of \ncapecitabine monotherapy with an incidence of less than 0.1 %. \n \nExposure to crushed or cut capecitabine tablets \nIn the instance of exposure to crushed or cut capecitabine tablets, the following adverse drug reactions \nhave been reported: eye irritation, eye swelling, skin rash, headache, paresthesia, diarrhea, nausea, \ngastric irritation, and vomiting. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly patients (see section 4.2) \nAn analysis of safety data in patients \u2265 60 years of age treated with capecitabine monotherapy and an \nanalysis of patients treated with capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy showed an increase \nin the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions and treatment-related serious \nadverse reactions compared to patients < 60 years of age. Patients \u2265 60 years of age treated with \ncapecitabine plus docetaxel also had more early withdrawals from treatment due to adverse reactions \ncompared to patients < 60 years of age. \n \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4,700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, increasing age (by 10 year increments) was \nstatistically significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HFS and diarrhoea and with a \ndecreased risk of developing neutropenia. \n \nGender \nThe results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4,700 patients treated with \ncapecitabine showed that in all studies combined, female gender was statistically significantly \nassociated with an increased risk of developing HFS and diarrhoea and with a decreased risk of \ndeveloping neutropenia. \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \nPatients with renal impairment (see section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2) \nAn analysis of safety data in patients treated with capecitabine monotherapy (colorectal cancer) with \nbaseline renal impairment showed an increase in the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 \nadverse reactions compared to patients with normal renal function (36 % in patients without renal \nimpairment n = 268, vs. 41 % in mild n = 257 and 54 % in moderate n = 59, respectively) (see \nsection 5.2). Patients with moderately impaired renal function show an increased rate of dose \nreduction (44 %) vs. 33 % and 32 % in patients with no or mild renal impairment and an increase in \nearly withdrawals from treatment (21 % withdrawals during the first two cycles) vs. 5 % and 8 % in \npatients with no or mild renal impairment. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe manifestations of acute overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, gastrointestinal \nirritation and bleeding, and bone marrow depression. Medical management of overdose should include \ncustomary therapeutic and supportive medical interventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical \nmanifestations and preventing their possible complications. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Pyrimidine analogues, antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01BC06 \n \nCapecitabine is a non-cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which functions as an orally \nadministered precursor of the cytotoxic moiety 5-FU. Capecitabine is activated via several enzymatic \nsteps (see section 5.2). The enzyme involved in the final conversion to 5-FU, thymidine phosphorylase \n(ThyPase), is found in tumour tissues, but also in normal tissues, albeit usually at lower levels. In \nhuman cancer xenograft models capecitabine demonstrated a synergistic effect in combination with \ndocetaxel, which may be related to the upregulation of ThyPase by docetaxel. \n \nThere is evidence that the metabolism of 5-FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation \nreaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thereby interfering with the synthesis of \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The incorporation of 5-FU also leads to inhibition of ribonucleic acid \n(RNA) and protein synthesis. Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the \neffect of 5-FU may be to create a thymidine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and death of \na cell. The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which proliferate \nmore rapidly and which metabolise 5-FU at a more rapid rate. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n20 \n\nColon and colorectal cancer \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in adjuvant colon cancer \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes\u2019 C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the adjuvant treatment of patients with \ncolon cancer (XACT Study; M66001). In this trial, 1,987 patients were randomised to treatment with \ncapecitabine (1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as \n3-week cycles for 24 weeks) or 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo Clinic regimen: 20 mg/m\u00b2 leucovorin \nintravenous followed by 425 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days for \n24 weeks). Capecitabine was at least equivalent to intravenous 5-FU/LV in disease-free survival in per \nprotocol population (hazard ratio 0.92; 95 % CI 0.80 - 1.06). In the all-randomised population, tests \nfor difference of capecitabine vs 5-FU/LV in disease-free and overall survival showed hazard ratios of \n0.88 (95 % CI 0.77 - 1.01; p = 0.068) and 0.86 (95 % CI 0.74 - 1.01; p = 0.060), respectively. The \nmedian follow up at the time of the analysis was 6.9 years. In a pre-planned multivariate Cox analysis, \nsuperiority of capecitabine compared with bolus 5-FU/LV was demonstrated. The following factors \nwere pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan for inclusion in the model: age, time from surgery to \nrandomisation, gender, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels at baseline, lymph nodes at baseline, \nand country. In the all-randomised population, capecitabine was shown to be superior to 5-FU/LV for \ndisease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.849; 95 % CI 0.739\u20130.976; p = 0.0212), as well as for overall \nsurvival (hazard ratio 0.828; 95 % CI 0.705\u20130.971; p = 0.0203). \n \nCombination therapy in adjuvant colon cancer \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 clinical trial in patients with stage III \n(Dukes\u2019 C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) \nfor the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer (NO16968 study). In this trial, 944 patients \nwere randomised to 3-week cycles for 24 weeks with capecitabine (1,000 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for \n2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period) in combination with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous \ninfusion over 2 hours on day 1 every 3 weeks); 942 patients were randomised to bolus 5-FU and \nleucovorin. In the primary analysis for DFS in the ITT population, XELOX was shown to be \nsignificantly superior to 5-FU/LV (HR = 0.80, 95 % CI = [0.69; 0.93]; p = 0.0045). The 3 year DFS \nrate was 71 % for XELOX versus 67 % for 5-FU/LV. The analysis for the secondary endpoint of RFS \nsupports these results with a HR of 0.78 (95 % CI = [0.67; 0.92]; p = 0.0024) for XELOX vs. \n5-FU/LV. XELOX showed a trend towards superior OS with a HR of 0.87 (95 % CI = [0.72; 1.05]; \np = 0.1486) which translates into a 13 % reduction in risk of death. The 5 year OS rate was 78 % for \nXELOX versus 74 % for 5-FU/LV. The efficacy data is based on a median observation time of \n59 months for OS and 57 months for DFS. The rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher in \nthe XELOX combination therapy arm (21 %) as compared with that of the 5-FU/LV monotherapy arm \n(9 %) in the ITT population. \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine in metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from two identically designed, multi centre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trials \n(SO14695; SO14796) support the use of capecitabine for first line treatment of metastatic colorectal \ncancer. In these trials, 603 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1,250 mg/m\u00b2 \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-week cycles). 604 patients \nwere randomised to treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo regimen: 20 mg/m\u00b2 leucovorin \nintravenous followed by 425 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days). The \noverall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were \n25.7 % (capecitabine) vs. 16.7 % (Mayo regimen); p < 0.0002. The median time to progression was \n140 days (capecitabine) vs. 144 days (Mayo regimen). Median survival was 392 days (capecitabine) \nvs. 391 days (Mayo regimen). Currently, no comparative data are available on capecitabine \nmonotherapy in colorectal cancer in comparison with first line combination regimens. \n \nCombination therapy in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer \nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16966) support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for \nthe first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The study contained two parts: an initial 2-arm \n\n\n\n21 \n\npart in which 634 patients were randomised to two different treatment groups, including XELOX or \nFOLFOX-4, and a subsequent 2x2 factorial part in which 1,401 patients were randomised to four \ndifferent treatment groups, including XELOX plus placebo, FOLFOX-4 plus placebo, XELOX plus \nbevacizumab, and FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab. See table 6 for treatment regimens. \n \nTable 6 Treatment regimens in study NO16966 (mCRC)  \n  Treatment Starting dose Schedule \n\nFOLFOX-4 \nor \n\nFOLFOX-4 + \nBevacizumab \n\nOxaliplatin 85 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous \n2 hr \n\nOxaliplatin on Day 1, every 2 weeks \n \nLeucovorin on Days 1 and 2, every \n2 weeks \n5-fluorouracil intravenous bolus/infusion, \neach on Days 1 and 2, every 2 weeks \n\n Leucovorin  200 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous \n2 hr \n\n5-Fluorouracil 400 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous \nbolus, followed by \n600 mg/ m\u00b2 intravenous \n22 hr \n\nPlacebo or \nBevacizumab \n\n5 mg/kg intravenous \n30 - 90 mins \n\nDay 1, prior to FOLFOX-4, every 2 weeks \n\nXELOX \nor \n\nXELOX+ \nBevacizumab \n\nOxaliplatin 130 mg/m\u00b2 intravenous \n2 hr \n\nOxaliplatin on Day 1, every 3 weeks \ncapecitabine oral twice daily for 2 weeks \n(followed by 1 week off- treatment) \n\nCapecitabine 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 oral twice \ndaily \n\nPlacebo or \nBevacizumab \n\n7.5 mg/kg intravenous \n30 - 90 mins \n\nDay 1, prior to XELOX, every 3 weeks \n\n5-Fluorouracil: intravenous bolus injection immediately after leucovorin \n \nNon-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in the \noverall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in the eligible \npatient population and the intent-to-treat population (see table 7). The results indicate that XELOX is \nequivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see table 7). A comparison of XELOX plus \nbevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab was a pre-specified exploratory analysis. In this \ntreatment subgroup comparison, XELOX plus bevacizumab was similar compared to FOLFOX-4 plus \nbevacizumab in terms of PFS (hazard ratio 1.01; 97.5 % CI 0.84 \u2013 1.22). The median follow up at the \ntime of the primary analyses in the intent-to-treat population was 1.5 years; data from analyses \nfollowing an additional 1 year of follow up are also included in table 7. However, the on-treatment \nPFS analysis did not confirm the results of the general PFS and OS analysis: the hazard ratio of \nXELOX versus FOLFOX-4 was 1.24 with 97.5 % CI 1.07\u20131.44. Although sensitivity analyses show \nthat differences in regimen schedules and timing of tumour assessments impact the on-treatment PFS \nanalysis, a full explanation for this result has not been found. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\nTable 7 Key efficacy results for the non-inferiority analysis of study NO16966 \n\nPRIMARY ANALYSIS \n\n XELOX/ XELOX+P/ \nXELOX+BV \n(EPP*: N = 967; ITT**: \nN = 1,017) \n\nFOLFOX-4/FOLFOX-4+P \n/FOLFOX-4+BV \n(EPP*: N = 937; ITT**: \nN = 1,017) \n\n \n\nPopulation Median time to event (days) HR \n(97.5 % CI) \n\nParameter: Progression-free survival \n\nEPP \nITT \n\n241 \n244 \n\n259 \n259 \n\n1.05 (0.94; 1.18) \n1.04 (0.93; 1.16) \n\nParameter: Overall survival \n\nEPP \nITT \n\n577 \n581 \n\n549 \n553 \n\n0.97 (0.84; 1.14) \n0.96 (0.83; 1.12) \n\nADDITIONAL 1 YEAR OF FOLLOW UP \n\nPopulation Median time to event (days) HR \n(97.5 % CI) \n\nParameter: Progression-free survival \n\nEPP \nITT \n\n242 \n244 \n\n259 \n259 \n\n1.02 (0.92; 1.14) \n1.01 (0.91; 1.12) \n\nParameter: Overall survival \n\nEPP \nITT \n\n600 \n602 \n\n594 \n596 \n\n1.00 (0.88; 1.13) \n0.99 (0.88; 1.12) \n\n*EPP = eligible patient population; **ITT = intent-to-treat population. \n \nIn a randomised, controlled phase III study (CAIRO), the effect of using capecitabine at a starting dose \nof 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan for the first-line treatment \nof patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was studied. 820 Patients were randomised to receive \neither sequential treatment (n = 410) or combination treatment (n = 410). Sequential treatment \nconsisted of first-line capecitabine (1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for 14 days), second-line irinotecan \n(350 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1), and third-line combination of capecitabine (1,000 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for \n14 days) with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1). Combination treatment consisted of first-line \ncapecitabine (1,000 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for 14 days) combined with irinotecan (250 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1) \n(XELIRI) and second-line capecitabine (1,000 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for 14 days) plus oxaliplatin \n(130 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1). All treatment cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. In first-line \ntreatment the median PFS in the intent-to-treat population was 5.8 months (95 %CI 5.1 - 6.2 months) \nfor capecitabine monotherapy and 7.8 months (95 %CI 7.0-8.3 months; p = 0.0002) for XELIRI. \nHowever this was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and neutropenia \nduring first-line treatment with XELIRI (26 % and 11 % for XELIRI and first line capecitabine \nrespectively). \n \nThe XELIRI has been compared with 5-FU + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in three randomised studies in \npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The XELIRI regimens included capecitabine 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 \ntwice daily on days 1 to 14 of a 3-week cycle combined with irinotecan 250 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1. In the \nlargest study (BICC-C), patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n = 144), \nbolus 5-FU (mIFL) (n = 145) or XELIRI (n = 141) and were additionally randomised to receive either \ndouble-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, \n5.9 months for mIFL (p = 0.004) for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for XELIRI \n(p = 0.015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (p = 0.09), and \n\n\n\n23 \n\n18.9 months for XELIRI (p = 0.27). Patients treated with XELIRI experienced excessive \ngastrointestinal toxicity compared with FOLFIRI (diarrhoea 48 % and 14 % for XELIRI and FOLFIRI \nrespectively). \n \nIn the EORTC study patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n = 41) or \nXELIRI (n = 44) with additional randomisation to either double-blind treatment with celecoxib or \nplacebo. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were shorter for XELIRI versus FOLFIRI (PFS \n5.9 versus 9.6 months and OS 14.8 versus 19.9 months), in addition to which excessive rates of \ndiarrhoea were reported in patients receiving the XELIRI regimen (41 % XELIRI, 5.1 % FOLFIRI).  \n\nIn the study published by Skof et al, patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI or XELIRI. \nOverall response rate was 49 % in the XELIRI and 48 % in the FOLFIRI arm (p = 0.76). At the end of \ntreatment, 37 % of patients in the XELIRI and 26 % of patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without \nevidence of the disease (p = 0.56). Toxcity was similar between treatments with the exception of \nneutropenia reported more commonly in patients treated with FOLFIRI. \n\nMontagnani et al used the results from the above three studies to provide an overall analysis of \nrandomised studies comparing FOLFIRI and XELIRI treatment regimens in the treatment of mCRC. \nA significant reduction in the risk of progression was associated with FOLFIRI (HR, 0.76; 95 % CI, \n0.62-0.95; P < 0.01), a result partly due to poor tolerance to the XELIRI regimens used. \n\nData from a randomised clinical study (Souglakos et al, 2012) comparing FOLFIRI + bevacizumab \nwith XELIRI + bevacizumab showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between treatments. \nPatients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (Arm-A, n = 167) or XELIRI \nplus bevacizumab (Arm-B, n-166). For Arm B, the XELIRI regimen used capecitabine 1,000 mg/m\u00b2 \ntwice daily for 14 days + irinotecan 250 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1. Median PFS was 10.0 and 8.9 months; \np = 0.64, overall survival 25.7 and 27.5 months; p = 0.55 and response rates 45.5 and 39.8 %; p = 0.32 \nfor FOLFIRI-Bev and XELIRI-Bev, respectively. Patients treated with XELIRI + bevacizumab \nreported a significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia and hand-foot skin reactions \nthan patients treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab with significantly increased treatment delays, dose \nreductions and treatment discontinuations. \n\nData from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase II study (AIO KRK 0604) supports the use of \ncapecitabine at a starting dose of 800 mg/m\u00b2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan \nand bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 120 Patients \nwere randomised to a modified XELIRI regimen with capecitabine 800 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for two \nweeks followed by a 7-day rest period), irinotecan (200 mg/m\u00b2 as a 30 minute infusion on day 1 every \n3 weeks), and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1every 3 weeks); \n127 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1,000 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for two weeks \nfollowed by a 7-day rest period), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m\u00b2 as a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), \nand bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks).

In this trial, 627 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have received prior \ntreatment with irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimidine regimen as first line therapy were \nrandomised to treatment with XELOX or FOLFOX-4. For the dosing schedule of XELOX and \nFOLFOX-4 (without addition of placebo or bevacizumab), refer to table 6. XELOX was demonstrated \nto be non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 in terms of PFS in the per-protocol population and intent-to-treat \npopulation (see table 9). The results indicate that XELOX is equivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of \noverall survival (see table 9).

In this trial, 160 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1,000 mg/m\u00b2 \ntwice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin (80 mg/m\u00b2 as a 2-hour infusion \nevery 3 weeks). A total of 156 patients were randomised to treatment with 5-FU (800 mg/m\u00b2 per day, \ncontinuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m\u00b2 as a 2-hour infusion on day \n1, every 3 weeks). Capecitabine in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior to 5-FU in \ncombination with cisplatin in terms of PFS in the per protocol analysis (hazard ratio 0.81; 95 % CI \n0.63 \u2013 1.04). The median PFS was 5.6 months (capecitabine + cisplatin) versus 5.0 months \n(5-FU + cisplatin). The hazard ratio for duration of survival (overall survival) was similar to the \nhazard ratio for PFS (hazard ratio 0.85; 95 % CI 0.64 \u2013 1.13). The median duration of survival was \n10.5 months (capecitabine + cisplatin) versus 9.3 months (5-FU + cisplatin). \n \nData from a randomised multicentre, phase III study comparing capecitabine to 5-FU and oxaliplatin \nto cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the first-line \ntreatment of advanced gastric cancer (REAL-2). In this trial, 1,002 patients were randomised in a 2x2 \nfactorial design to one of the following 4 arms: \n \n- ECF: epirubicin (50 mg/ m\u00b2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m\u00b2 as a two \n\nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) and 5-FU (200 mg/m\u00b2 daily given by continuous infusion \nvia a central line). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n- ECX: epirubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m\u00b2 as a two \nhour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily continuously). \n\n- EOF: epirubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m\u00b2 given as \na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and 5-FU (200 mg/m\u00b2 daily given by continuous \ninfusion via a central line). \n\n- EOX: epirubicin (50 mg/m\u00b2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m\u00b2 given as \na 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily \ncontinuously). \n\n \nThe primary efficacy analyses in the per protocol population demonstrated non-inferiority in overall \nsurvival for capecitabine- vs 5-FU-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.86; 95 % CI 0.8 \u2013 0.99) and for \noxaliplatin- vs cisplatin-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.92; 95 % CI 0.80 \u2013 1.1). The median overall \nsurvival was 10.9 months in capecitabine-based regimens and 9.6 months in 5-FU based regimens. \nThe median overall survival was 10.0 months in cisplatin-based regimens and 10.4 months in \noxaliplatin-based regimens. \n \nCapecitabine has also been used in combination with oxaliplatin for the treatment of advanced gastric \ncancer. Studies with capecitabine monotherapy indicate that capecitabine has activity in advanced \ngastric cancer. \n \nColon, colorectal and advanced gastric cancer: meta-analysis \n \nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials (studies SO14695, SO14796, M66001, NO16966, NO16967, \nM17032) supports capecitabine replacing 5-FU in mono- and combination treatment in gastrointestinal \ncancer. The pooled analysis includes 3,097 patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and \n3,074 patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. Median overall survival time was 703 days \n(95 % CI: 671; 745) in patients treated with capecitabine-containing regimens and 683 days (95 % CI: \n646; 715) in patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. The hazard ratio for overall survival was \n0.94 (95 % CI: 0.89; 1.00, p = 0.0489) indicating that capecitabine-containing regimens are \nnon-inferior to 5-FU-containing regimens. \n \nBreast cancer \n \nCombination therapy with capecitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer \nData from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial support the use of \ncapecitabine in combination with docetaxel for treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this \ntrial, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for \n2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period and docetaxel 75 mg/m\u00b2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion \nevery 3 weeks). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m\u00b2 as a \n1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel \ncombination arm (p = 0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 352 days \n(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator \nassessment) were 41.6 % (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 29.7 % (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to \nprogressive disease was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel combination arm (p < 0.0001). The \nmedian time to progression was 186 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). \n \nMonotherapy with capecitabine after failure of taxanes, anthracycline containing chemotherapy, and \nfor whom anthracycline therapy is not indicated \nData from two multicentre phase II clinical trials support the use of capecitabine monotherapy for \ntreatment of patients after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or \nfor whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. In these trials, a total of 236 patients were \ntreated with capecitabine (1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). The \noverall objective response rates (investigator assessment) were 20 % (first trial) and 25 % (second \ntrial). The median time to progression was 93 and 98 days. Median survival was 384 and 373 days. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nAll indications \n \nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4,700 patients treated with capecitabine \nmonotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple \nindications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that patients on capecitabine who \ndeveloped HFS had a longer overall survival compared to patients who did not develop HFS: median \noverall survival 1,100 days (95 % CI 1,007;1,200) vs 691 days (95 % CI 638;754) with a hazard ratio \nof 0.61 (95 % CI 0.56; 0.66). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to conduct studies with capecitabine in all \nsubsets of the paediatric population in adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum, gastric \nadenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of capecitabine have been evaluated over a dose range of 502 \u2013\n 3,514 mg/m\u00b2/day. The parameters of capecitabine, 5\u2019-DFCR and 5\u2019-DFUR measured on days 1 and \n14 were similar. The AUC of 5-FU was 30 % - 35 % higher on day 14. Capecitabine dose reduction \ndecreases systemic exposure to 5-FU more than dose-proportionally, due to non--linear \npharmacokinetics for the active metabolite.  \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration, capecitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, followed by extensive \nconversion to the metabolites, 5\u2019-DFCR and 5\u2019-DFUR. Administration with food decreases the rate of \ncapecitabine absorption, but only results in a minor effect on the AUC of 5\u2019-DFUR, and on the AUC \nof the subsequent metabolite 5-FU. At the dose of 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 on day 14 with administration after \nfood intake, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax in \u00b5g/ml) for capecitabine, 5\u2019-DFCR, 5\u2019-DFUR, \n5-FU and FBAL were 4.67, 3.05, 12.1, 0.95 and 5.46 respectively. The time to peak plasma \nconcentrations (Tmax in hours) were 1.50, 2.00, 2.00, 2.00 and 3.34. The AUC0-\u221e values in \u03bcg\u2022h/ml \nwere 7.75, 7.24, 24.6, 2.03 and 36.3. \n \nDistribution \nIn vitro human plasma studies have determined that capecitabine, 5\u2019-DFCR, 5\u2019-DFUR and 5-FU are \n54 %, 10 %, 62 % and 10 % protein bound, mainly to albumin. \n \nBiotransformation \nCapecitabine is first metabolised by hepatic carboxylesterase to 5\u2019-DFCR, which is then converted to \n5\u2019-DFUR by cytidine deaminase, principally located in the liver and tumour tissues. Further catalytic \nactivation of 5\u2019-DFUR then occurs by ThyPase. The enzymes involved in the catalytic activation are \nfound in tumour tissues but also in normal tissues, albeit usually at lower levels. The sequential \nenzymatic biotransformation of capecitabine to 5-FU leads to higher concentrations within tumour \ntissues. In the case of colorectal tumours, 5-FU generation appears to be in large part localised in \ntumour stromal cells. Following oral administration of capecitabine to patients with colorectal cancer, \nthe ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumours to adjacent tissues was 3.2 (ranged from 0.9 to \n8.0). The ratio of 5-FU concentration in tumour to plasma was 21.4 (ranged from 3.9 to 59.9, n = 8) \nwhereas the ratio in healthy tissues to plasma was 8.9 (ranged from 3.0 to 25.8, n = 8). ThyPase \nactivity was measured and found to be 4 times greater in primary colorectal tumour than in adjacent \nnormal tissue. According to immunohistochemical studies, ThyPase appears to be in large part \nlocalised in tumour stromal cells. \n \n5-FU is further catabolised by the enzyme DPD to the much less toxic dihydro-5-fluorouracil (FUH2). \nDihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5-fluoro-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA). \nFinally, \u03b2-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to FBAL which is cleared in the urine. DPD activity is the \nrate limiting step. Deficiency of DPD may lead to increased toxicity of capecitabine (see section 4.3 \nand 4.4). \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \nElimination \nThe elimination half-life (t1/2 in hours) of capecitabine, 5\u2019-DFCR, 5\u2019-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL were \n0.85, 1.11, 0.66, 0.76 and 3.23 respectively. Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly \nexcreted in urine; 95.5 % of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Faecal excretion is \nminimal (2.6 %). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL, which represents 57 % of the \nadministered dose. About 3 % of the administered dose is excreted in urine unchanged. \n \nCombination therapy \nPhase I studies evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of either docetaxel or \npaclitaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel or \npaclitaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel or paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of \n5\u2019-DFUR. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \nA population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after capecitabine treatment of 505 patients \nwith colorectal cancer dosed at 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 twice daily. Gender, presence or absence of liver \nmetastasis at baseline, Karnofsky Performance Status, total bilirubin, serum albumin, \naspartate-aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine-aminotransferase (ALAT) had no statistically \nsignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5\u2019-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL.  \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment due to liver metastases \nAccording to a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to moderate liver impairment due \nto liver metastases, the bioavailability of capecitabine and exposure to 5-FU may increase compared to \npatients with no liver impairment. There are no pharmacokinetic data on patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment  \nBased on a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to severe renal impairment, there is no \nevidence for an effect of creatinine clearance on the pharmacokinetics of intact drug and 5-FU. \nCreatinine clearance was found to influence the systemic exposure to 5\u2019-DFUR (35 % increase in \nAUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50 %) and to FBAL (114 % increase in AUC when \ncreatinine clearance decreases by 50 %). FBAL is a metabolite without antiproliferative activity. \n \nElderly  \nBased on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included patients with a wide range of ages \n(27 to 86 years) and included 234 (46 %) patients greater or equal to 65, age has no influence on the \npharmacokinetics of 5\u2019-DFUR and 5-FU. The AUC of FBAL increased with age (20 % increase in age \nresults in a 15 % increase in the AUC of FBAL). This increase is likely due to a change in renal \nfunction. \n \nEthnic factors  \nFollowing oral administration of 825 mg/m\u00b2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days, Japanese patients \n(n = 18) had about 36 % lower Cmax and 24 % lower AUC for capecitabine than Caucasian patients \n(n = 22). Japanese patients had also about 25 % lower Cmax and 34 % lower AUC for FBAL than \nCaucasian patients. The clinical relevance of these differences is unknown. No significant differences \noccurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5\u2019-DFCR, 5\u2019-DFUR, and 5-FU). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn repeat-dose toxicity studies, daily oral administration of capecitabine to cynomolgus monkeys and \nmice produced toxic effects on the gastrointestinal, lymphoid and haemopoietic systems, typical for \nfluoropyrimidines. These toxicities were reversible. Skin toxicity, characterised by \ndegenerative/regressive changes, was observed with capecitabine. Capecitabine was devoid of hepatic \nand CNS toxicities. Cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. PR- and QT-interval prolongation) was detectable in \ncynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration (100 mg/kg) but not after repeated oral dosing \n(1,379 mg/m\u00b2/day). \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nA two-year mouse carcinogenicity study produced no evidence of carcinogenicity by capecitabine. \n \nDuring standard fertility studies, impairment of fertility was observed in female mice receiving \ncapecitabine; however, this effect was reversible after a drug-free period. In addition, during a \n13-week study, atrophic and degenerative changes occurred in reproductive organs of male mice; \nhowever these effects were reversible after a drug-free period (see section 4.6). \n \nIn embryotoxicity and teratogenicity studies in mice, dose-related increases in foetal resorption and \nteratogenicity were observed. In monkeys, abortion and embryolethality were observed at high doses, \nbut there was no evidence of teratogenicity. \n \nCapecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster \nV79/HPRT gene mutation assay). However, similar to other nucleoside analogues (i.e., 5-FU), \ncapecitabine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes (in vitro) and a positive trend occurred in mouse \nbone marrow micronucleus tests (in vivo). \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Capecitabine medac is and what it is used for \n \nCapecitabine medac belongs to the group of medicines called \"cytostatic medicines\", which stop the \ngrowth of cancer cells. Capecitabine medac contains capecitabine, which itself is not a cytostatic \nmedicine. Only after being absorbed by the body is it changed into an active anti-cancer medicine \n(more in tumour tissue than in normal tissue). \n \nCapecitabine medac is used in the treatment of colon, rectal, gastric, or breast cancers. \nFurthermore, Capecitabine medac is used to prevent new occurrence of colon cancer after complete \nremoval of the tumour by surgery. \n \nCapecitabine medac may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Capecitabine medac \n \nDo not take Capecitabine medac \n\u2022 if you are allergic to capecitabine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). You must inform your doctor if you know that you have an allergy or over-reaction \nto this medicine, \n\n\u2022 if you previously have had severe reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy (a group of anticancer \nmedicines such as fluorouracil), \n\n\u2022 if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, \n\u2022 if you have severely low levels of white cells or platelets in the blood (leukopenia, neutropenia \n\nor thrombocytopenia), \n\u2022 if you have severe liver or kidney problems, \n\u2022 if you know that you do not have any activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase \n\n(DPD) (complete DPD defiency), \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\u2022 if you are being treated now or have been treated in the last 4 weeks with brivudine as part of \nherpes zoster (chickenpox or shingles) therapy. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Capecitabine medac \n\u2022 if you know that you have a partial deficiency in the activity of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine \n\ndehydrogenase (DPD), \n\u2022 if you have a family member who has partial or complete deficiency of the enzyme \n\ndihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), \n\u2022 if you have liver or kidney diseases, \n\u2022 if you have or had heart problems (for example an irregular heart beat or pains to the chest, jaw \n\nand back, brought on by physical effort and due to problems with the blood flow to the heart), \n\u2022 if you have brain diseases (for example cancer that has spread to the brain) or nerve damage \n\n(neuropathy), \n\u2022 if you have calcium imbalances (seen in blood tests), \n\u2022 if you have diabetes, \n\u2022 if you cannot keep food or water in your body because of severe nausea and vomiting, \n\u2022 if you have diarrhoea, \n\u2022 if you are or become dehydrated, \n\u2022 if you have imbalances of ions in your blood (electrolyte imbalances, seen in tests), \n\u2022 if you have a history of eye problems as you may need extra monitoring of your eyes, \n\u2022 if you have a severe skin reaction. \n \nDPD deficiency  \nDPD deficiency is a genetic condition that is not usually associated with health problems unless you \nreceive certain medicines. If you have DPD deficiency and take Capecitabine medac, you are at an \nincreased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is recommended to \ntest you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the enzyme you \nshould not take Capecitabine medac. If you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your \ndoctor might prescribe a reduced dose. If you have negative test results for DPD deficiency, severe \nand life-threatening side effects may still occur. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nCapecitabine medac is not indicated in children and adolescents. Do not give Capecitabine medac to \nchildren and adolescents. \n \nOther medicines and Capecitabine medac \nBefore starting treatment, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might \ntake any other medicines. This is extremely important, as taking more than one medicine at the same \ntime can strengthen or weaken the effect of the medicines.  \n \nYou must not take brivudine (an anti-viral medicine for the treatment of shingles or chickenpox) \nat the same time as capecitabine treatment (including during any rest periods when you are not \ntaking any capecitabine tablets). \nIf you have taken brivudine you must wait for at least 4 weeks after stopping brivudine before \nstarting to take capecitabine. See also section \u201cDo not take Capecitabine medac\u201d. \n \nAlso, you need to be particularly careful if you are taking any of the following: \n\u2022 gout medicines (allopurinol) \n\u2022 blood-thinning medicines (coumarin, warfarin) \n\u2022 medicines for seizures or tremors (phenytoin) \n\u2022 interferon alpha \n\u2022 radiotherapy and certain medicines used to treat cancer (folinic acid, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, \n\ncisplatin, irinotecan) \n\u2022 medicines used to treat folic acid deficiency \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \nCapecitabine medac with food and drink \nYou should take Capecitabine medac no later than 30 minutes after meals. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.You must not take Capecitabine \nmedac if you are pregnant or think you might be. \nYou must not breast-feed if you are taking Capecitabine medac and for 2 weeks after the last dose. \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant you should use effective contraception during \ntreatment with Capecitabine medac and for 6 months after the last dose. \nIf you are a male patient and your female partner could become pregnant, you should use effective \ncontraception during treatment with Capecitabine medac and for 3 months after the last dose. \n \nDriving and using machines \nCapecitabine medac may make you feel dizzy, nauseous or tired. It is therefore possible that \nCapecitabine medac could affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines.  \n \nCapecitabine medac contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nCapecitabine medac contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Capecitabine medac \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nCapecitabine medac should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer \nmedicines. \n \nYour doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of Capecitabine \nmedac is based on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and weight. The usual \ndose for adults is 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and evening). Two \nexamples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m has a body \nsurface area of 1.7 m\u00b2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times daily. A \nperson whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m\u00b2 and should \ntake 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. \n \nYour doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need \nto take it. \n \nYour doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. \n\u2022 Take the tablets in the morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. \n\u2022 Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow \n\nwhole with water. Do not crush or cut tablets. If you cannot swallow Capecitabine medac \ntablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. \n\n\u2022 It is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. \n \nCapecitabine medac tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no \ntablets are taken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle. \n \n\n\n\n51 \n\nIn combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 of body \nsurface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no \nrest period). \n \nIf you take more Capecitabine medac than you should \nIf you take more Capecitabine medac than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before \ntaking the next dose. \nYou might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling, \nor being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the \nintestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your \ndoctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. \n \nIf you forget to take Capecitabine medac \nDo not take the missed dose at all. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, \ncontinue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. \n \nIf you stop taking Capecitabine medac \nThere are no side effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. In case you are using \ncoumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that \nyour doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSTOP taking Capecitabine medac immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms \noccur: \n\u2022 Diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal \n\nbowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night. \n\u2022 Vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. \n\u2022 Nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than \n\nusual. \n\u2022 Stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and or throat. \n\u2022 Hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or \n\nfeet. \n\u2022 Fever: if you have a temperature of 38 \u00b0C or greater. \n\u2022 Infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms. \n\u2022 Chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs \n\nduring exercise. \n\u2022 Stevens-Johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and \n\nblisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in \nparticular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) \nand/or fever. \n\n \nIf caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after treatment discontinuation. If \nthese side effects continue, however, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may instruct you \nto restart treatment at a lower dose. \n \nIf severe stomatitis (sores in your mouth and/or throat), mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia \n(increased risk for infections), or neurotoxicity occurs during the first cycle of treatment a DPD \ndeficiency may be involved (please see Section 2: Warning and precautions). \n \n\n\n\n52 \n\nHand and foot skin-reaction can lead to loss of fingerprint, which could impact your identification by \nfingerprint scan. \n \nIn addition to the above, when Capecitabine medac is used alone, very common side effects which \nmay affect more than 1 in 10 people are: \n\u2022 abdominal pain \n\u2022 rash, dry or itchy skin \n\u2022 tiredness \n\u2022 loss of appetite (anorexia) \n \nThese side effects can become severe; therefore, it is important that you always contact your doctor \nimmediately when you start to experience a side effect. Your doctor may instruct you to decrease the \ndose and/or temporarily discontinue treatment with Capecitabine medac. This will help reduce the \nlikelihood that the side effect continues or becomes severe. \n \nOther side effects are: \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 decreases in the number of white blood cells or red blood cells (seen in tests) \n\u2022 dehydration, weight loss \n\u2022 sleeplessness (insomnia), depression \n\u2022 headache, sleepiness, dizziness, abnormal sensation in the skin (numbness or tingling sensation), \n\ntaste changes \n\u2022 eye irritation, increased tears, eye redness (conjunctivitis) \n\u2022 inflammation of the veins (thrombophlebitis) \n\u2022 shortness of breath, nose bleeds, cough, runny nose \n\u2022 cold sores or other herpes infections \n\u2022 infections of the lungs or respiratory system (e.g. pneumonia or bronchitis) \n\u2022 bleeding from the gut, constipation, pain in upper abdomen, indigestion, excess wind, dry mouth \n\u2022 skin rash, hair loss (alopecia), skin reddening, dry skin, itching (pruritus), skin discolouration, \n\nskin loss, skin inflammation, nail disorder \n\u2022 pain in the joints or in the limbs (extremities), chest or back \n\u2022 fever, swelling in the limbs, feeling ill \n\u2022 problems with liver function (seen in blood tests) and increased blood bilirubin (excreted by the \n\nliver) \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n\u2022 blood infection, urinary tract infection, infection of the skin, infections in the nose and throat, \n\nfungal infections (including those of the mouth), influenza, gastroenteritis, tooth abscess \n\u2022 lumps under the skin (lipoma) \n\u2022 decreases in blood cells including platelets, thinning of blood (seen in tests) \n\u2022 allergy \n\u2022 diabetes, decrease in blood potassium, malnutrition, increased blood triglycerides \n\u2022 confusional state, panic attacks, depressed mood, decreased libido \n\u2022 difficulty speaking, impaired memory, loss of movement coordination, balance disorder, \n\nfainting, nerve damage (neuropathy) and problems with sensation \n\u2022 blurred or double vision \n\u2022 vertigo, ear pain \n\u2022 irregular heartbeat and palpitations (arrhythmias), chest pain and heart attack (infarction) \n\u2022 blood clots in the deep veins, high or low blood pressure, hot flushes, cold limbs (extremities), \n\npurple spots on the skin \n\u2022 blood clots in the veins in the lung (pulmonary embolism), collapsed lung, coughing up blood, \n\nasthma, shortness of breath on exertion \n\u2022 bowel obstruction, collection of fluid in the abdomen, inflammation of the small or large \n\nintestine, the stomach or the oesophagus, pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal discomfort, \nheartburn (reflux of food from the stomach), blood in the stool \n\n\n\n53 \n\n\u2022 jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) \n\u2022 skin ulcer and blister, reaction of the skin with sunlight, reddening of palms, swelling or pain of \n\nthe face \n\u2022 joint swelling or stiffness, bone pain, muscle weakness or stiffness \n\u2022 fluid collection in the kidneys, increased frequency of urination during the night, incontinence, \n\nblood in the urine, increase in blood creatinine (sign of kidney dysfunction) \n\u2022 unusual bleeding from the vagina \n\u2022 swelling (oedema), chills and rigors \n \nSome of these side effects are more common when capecitabine is used with other medicines for the \ntreatment of cancer.

"Section_3": {"Title": "3. how to take capecitabine medac", "Section_Content": "always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. capecitabine medac should only be prescribed by a doctor experienced in the use of anticancer medicines. your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. the dose of capecitabine medac is based on your body surface area. this is calculated from your height and weight. the usual dose for adults is 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning and evening). two examples are provided here: a person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 1.64 m has a body surface area of 1.7 m\u00b2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg two times daily. a person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 2.00 m\u00b2 and should take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. your doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need to take it. your doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. take the tablets in the morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow whole with water. do not crush or cut tablets. if you cannot swallow capecitabine medac tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. it is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. capecitabine medac tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no tablets are taken). this 21 day period is one treatment cycle. in combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1,250 mg/m\u00b2 of body surface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no rest period). if you take more capecitabine medac than you should if you take more capecitabine medac than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before taking the next dose. you might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should: feeling, or being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the intestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. if you forget to take capecitabine medac do not take the missed dose at all. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. instead, continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. if you stop taking capecitabine medac there are no side effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. in case you are using coumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "capecitabine medac", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset":

cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. stop taking capecitabine medac immediately and contact your doctor if any of these symptoms occur: diarrhoea: if you have an increase of 4 or more bowel movements compared to your normal bowel movements each day or any diarrhoea at night. vomiting: if you vomit more than once in a 24-hour time period. nausea: if you lose your appetite, and the amount of food you eat each day is much less than usual. stomatitis: if you have pain, redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and or throat. hand-and-foot skin-reaction: if you have pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet. fever: if you have a temperature of 38 or greater. infection: if you experience signs of infection caused by bacteria or virus, or other organisms. chest pain: if you experience pain localised to the centre of the chest, especially if it occurs during exercise. stevens-johnson syndrome: if you experience painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters and/or other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membrane (e.g. mouth and lips), in particular if you had before light sensitivity, infections of the respiratory system (e.g. bronchitis) and/or fever. if caught early, these side effects usually improve within 2 to 3 days after treatment discontinuation. if these side effects continue, however, contact your doctor immediately. your doctor may instruct you to restart treatment at a lower dose. if severe stomatitis (sores in your mouth and/or throat), mucosal inflammation, diarrhoea, neutropenia (increased risk for infections), or neurotoxicity occurs during the first cycle of treatment a dpd deficiency may be involved (please see section 2: warning and precautions). hand and foot skin-reaction can lead to loss of fingerprint, which could impact your identification by fingerprint scan. in addition to the above, when capecitabine medac is used alone, very common side effects which may affect more than 1 in 10 people are: abdominal pain rash, dry or itchy skin tiredness loss of appetite (anorexia) these side effects can become severe; therefore, it is important that you always contact your doctor immediately when you start to experience a side effect. your doctor may instruct you to decrease the dose and/or temporarily discontinue treatment with capecitabine medac. this will help reduce the likelihood that the side effect continues or becomes severe. other side effects are: common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): decreases in the number of white blood cells or red blood cells (seen in tests) dehydration, weight loss sleeplessness (insomnia), depression headache, sleepiness, dizziness, abnormal sensation in the skin (numbness or tingling sensation), taste changes eye irritation, increased tears, eye

liver function (seen in blood tests) and increased blood bilirubin (excreted by the liver) uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): blood infection, urinary tract infection, infection of the skin, infections in the nose and throat, fungal infections (including those of the mouth), influenza, gastroenteritis, tooth abscess lumps under the skin (lipoma) decreases in blood cells including platelets, thinning of blood (seen in tests) allergy diabetes, decrease in blood potassium, malnutrition, increased blood triglycerides confusional state, panic attacks, depressed mood, decreased

weakness or stiffness fluid collection in the kidneys, increased frequency of urination during the night, incontinence, blood in the urine, increase in blood creatinine (sign of kidney dysfunction) unusual bleeding from the vagina swelling (oedema), chills and rigors some of these side effects are more common when capecitabine is used with other medicines for the treatment of cancer. other side-effects seen in this setting are the following: common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): decrease in blood sodium, magnesium or calcium, increase in blood sugar nerve pain ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus), loss of hearing vein inflammation hiccups, change in voice pain or altered/abnormal sensation in the mouth, pain in the jaw sweating, night sweats muscle spasm difficulty in urination, blood or protein in the urine bruising or reaction at the injection site (caused by medicines given by injection at the same time) rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): narrowing or
