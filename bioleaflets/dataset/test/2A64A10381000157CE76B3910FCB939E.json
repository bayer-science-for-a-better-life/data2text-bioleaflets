NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 10 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 10 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.4 ml (25 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n3 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n5 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n6 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n7 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n8 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n9 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n10 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n11 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n12 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 15 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 15 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.375 ml (40 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n15 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n16 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n17 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n18 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n19 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n20 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n21 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n22 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n23 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n24 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n27 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n29 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n30 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n31 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n32 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n33 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n34 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n35 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n36 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 30 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 30 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.3 ml (100 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n39 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n41 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n42 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n43 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n44 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n45 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n46 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n47 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n48 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 40 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.4 ml (100 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n51 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n52 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n53 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n54 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n55 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n56 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n57 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n58 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n59 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n60 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 50 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.5 ml (100 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n63 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n65 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n66 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n67 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n68 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n69 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n70 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n71 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n72 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 60 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 60 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.3 ml (200 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n75 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n77 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n78 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n79 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n80 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n81 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n82 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n83 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n84 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 80 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.4 ml (200 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n87 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n88 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n89 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n90 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n91 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n92 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n93 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n94 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n95 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n96 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n99 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n101 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n102 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n103 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n104 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n105 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n106 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n107 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n108 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 130 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 130 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.65 ml (200 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n111 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n113 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n114 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n115 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n116 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n117 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n118 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n119 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n120 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 150 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.3 ml (500 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n123 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n124 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n125 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n126 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n127 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n128 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n129 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n130 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n131 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n132 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n135 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n137 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n138 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n139 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n140 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n141 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n142 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n143 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n144 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 500 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled syringe contains 500 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 1 ml (500 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled syringe. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled syringe.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal \nare given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n147 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n149 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n150 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n151 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n152 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n153 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n154 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa  retains a very narrow specificity \nfor the erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n155 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients.  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n156 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 15 micrograms solution for injection in a vial. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 15 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 1 ml (15 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a vial. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied in vials.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n159 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n160 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u226511 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \n\u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an \ninitial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.

Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between 500 \n\u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n162 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n163 \n\n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n164 \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n165 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n166 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n167 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg (SD \n0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was 73 \nhours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n168 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a vial. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied in vials.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n171 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n172 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u226511 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \n\u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an \ninitial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n173 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between 500 \n\u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n174 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n175 \n\n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n176 \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n177 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n178 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n179 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg (SD \n0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was 73 \nhours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n180 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 40 micrograms solution for injection in a vial. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 40 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 1 ml (40 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a vial. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied in vials.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n183 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u226511 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \n\u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an \ninitial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n185 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between 500 \n\u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n186 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n187 \n\n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n188 \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n189 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n190 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n191 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg (SD \n0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was 73 \nhours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n192 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 60 micrograms solution for injection in a vial. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 60 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 1 ml (60 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a vial. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo is supplied in vials.  The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n195 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u226511 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \n\u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an \ninitial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n197 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between 500 \n\u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n198 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n199 \n\n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n200 \n\nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n201 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n202 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n203 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg (SD \n0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was 73 \nhours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every 3 \nweeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of the \nterminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n204 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nNespo 10 micrograms solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 10 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.4 ml (25 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n207 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n208 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n209 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n210 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n211 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n212 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n213 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n214 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n215 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n216 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 15 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.375 ml (40 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n219 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n220 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n221 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n222 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n223 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n224 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n225 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n226 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n227 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n228 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n231 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n232 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n233 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n234 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n235 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n236 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n237 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n238 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n239 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n240 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n243 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n244 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n245 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n246 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n247 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n248 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n249 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n250 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n251 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n252 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 40 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.4 ml (100 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n255 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n256 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n257 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n258 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n259 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n260 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n261 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n262 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n263 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n264 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n267 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n268 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n269 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n270 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n271 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n272 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n273 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n274 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n275 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n276 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n279 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n280 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n281 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n282 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n283 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n284 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n285 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n286 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n287 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n288 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 80 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.4 ml (200 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n291 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n293 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n294 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n295 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n296 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n297 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n298 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n299 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n300 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n303 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n304 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n305 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n306 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n307 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n308 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n309 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n310 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n311 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n312 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n315 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n317 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n318 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n319 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n320 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n321 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n322 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n323 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n324 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach pre-filled pen contains 150 micrograms of darbepoetin alfa in 0.3 ml (500 \u00b5g/ml). \n \nDarbepoetin alfa is produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO-K1). \n \nFor excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n327 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.

When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n329 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n330 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n331 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n332 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n333 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n334 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n335 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n336 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n339 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n340 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n341 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n342 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n343 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n344 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n345 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n346 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n347 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n348 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection (injection) in a pre-filled pen. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults and \npaediatric patients. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving \nchemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nNespo treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications. \n \nNespo (SureClick) is supplied ready for use in a pre-filled pen.  The pre-filled pen is only for \nsubcutaneous administration. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. \n \nTreatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients \n \nAnaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a \nphysician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.  Nespo \nshould be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not \ngreater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis to avoid the puncture of peripheral veins.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.    A rise in haemoglobin of \ngreater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) over a four week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate \ndose adjustment should be made as provided.  \n \nTreatment with Nespo is divided into two stages \u2013 correction and maintenance phase. Guidance is \ngiven separately for adult and paediatric patients.  Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year \nof age has not been studied: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n351 \n\nAdult patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nThe initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single \ninjection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, an initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be \nadministered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two weeks.  If the increase in \nhaemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) increase the dose by \napproximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once every four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%. If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l),  a dose reduction should be \nconsidered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be reduced by approximately \n25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to increase, the dose should be temporarily \nwithheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose.    \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nIn the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be administered as a single injection once weekly or \nonce every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting from once weekly to once every other week dosing \nwith Nespo should initially receive a dose equivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In \npatients not on dialysis, once the target haemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week \ndosing, Nespo may be administered subcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice \nthe previous once every two week dose.   \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.  \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that adult patients receiving r-HuEPO one, two or three times \nweekly may be converted to once weekly or once every other week Nespo. The initial weekly dose of \nNespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing the total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 200.  \nThe initial every other week dose of Nespo (\u03bcg/every other week) can be determined by dividing the \ntotal cumulative dose of r-HuEPO administered over a two-week period by 200.  Because of \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n352 \n\nindividual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When \nsubstituting Nespo for r-HuEPO the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and \nthe same route of administration should be used. \n \nPaediatric patients with chronic renal failure \n \nCorrection Phase \n \nFor patients \u2265 11 years of age, the initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is \n0.45 \u00b5g/kg body weight, as a single injection once weekly.  Alternatively, in patients not on dialysis, \nan initial dose of 0.75 \u03bcg/kg may be administered subcutaneously as a single injection once every two \nweeks.  If the increase in haemoglobin is inadequate (less than 1 g/dl (0.6 mmol/l) in four weeks) \nincrease the dose by approximately 25%. Dose increases must not be made more frequently than once \nevery four weeks. \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase. If the haemoglobin exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, \nthe dose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues \nto increase, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at \nwhich point therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nThe haemoglobin should be measured every one or two weeks until it is stable. Thereafter the \nhaemoglobin can be measured at longer intervals.  \n \nNo guidance regarding the correction of haemoglobin is available for paediatric patients 1 to 10 years \nof age. \n \nMaintenance Phase \n \nFor paediatric patients \u2265 11 years of age, in the maintenance phase, Nespo may continue to be \nadministered as a single injection once weekly or once every two weeks. Dialysis patients converting \nfrom once weekly to once every other week dosing with Nespo should initially receive a dose \nequivalent to twice the previous once weekly dose.  In patients not on dialysis, once the target \nhaemoglobin has been achieved with once every two week dosing, Nespo may be administered \nsubcutaneously once monthly using an initial dose equal to twice the previous once every two week \ndose.   \n \nFor pediatric patients 1-18 years of age, clinical data in paediatric patients has demonstrated that \npatients receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly may be converted to once weekly Nespo, and \nthose receiving r-HuEPO once weekly may be converted to once every other week Nespo.  The initial \nweekly or once every other week pediatric dose of Nespo (\u00b5g/week) can be determined by dividing \nthe total weekly dose of r-HuEPO (IU/week) by 240.  Because of individual variability, titration to \noptimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients. When substituting Nespo for r-HuEPO \nthe haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks and the same route of administration \nshould be used. \n \nDosing should be titrated as necessary to maintain the haemoglobin target.  \n \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain haemoglobin at the desired level, it is recommended that \nthe dose is adjusted by approximately 25%.  \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in four weeks reduce the dose by \napproximately 25%, depending on the rate of increase.  If the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l), a dose reduction should be considered. If the haemoglobin continues to increase, the \ndose should be reduced by approximately 25%.  If after a dose reduction, haemoglobin continues to \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n353 \n\nincrease, the dose should be temporarily withheld until the haemoglobin begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be reinitiated at approximately 25% lower than the previous dose.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to \nprovide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia. \n \nAfter any dose or schedule adjustment the haemoglobin should be monitored every one or two weeks.  \nDose changes in the maintenance phase of treatment should not be made more frequently than every \ntwo weeks. \n \nWhen changing the route of administration the same dose must be used and the haemoglobin \nmonitored every one or two weeks so that the appropriate dose adjustments can be made to keep the \nhaemoglobin at the desired level.  \n \nTreatment of symptomatic chemotherapy induced anaemia in cancer patients \n \nNespo should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin \nconcentration \u2264 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/l)) in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l). Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of \ndisease; a physician\u2019s evaluation of the individual patient\u2019s clinical course and condition is necessary.   \n \nDue to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and \nbelow the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed \nthrough dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl \n(6.2 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl \n(7.5 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustments for when haemoglobin \nvalues exceeding 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) are observed are described below.  \n \nThe recommended initial dose is 500 \u03bcg (6.75 \u03bcg/kg) given once every three weeks, or once weekly \ndosing can be given at 2.25 \u03bcg/kg body weight.   If the clinical response of the patient (fatigue, \nhaemoglobin response) is inadequate after nine weeks, further therapy may not be effective.  \n \nNespo therapy should be discontinued approximately four weeks after the end of chemotherapy. \n \nOnce the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Nespo is used to maintain \nhaemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia. Appropriate dose titration between \n500 \u03bcg, 300 \u03bcg, and 150 \u03bcg should be considered.   \n \nPatients should be monitored closely, if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dose \nshould be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.  Treatment with Nespo should be temporarily \ndiscontinued if haemoglobin levels exceed 13 g/dl (8.1 mmol/l). Therapy should be reinitiated at \napproximately 25% lower than the previous dose after haemoglobin levels fall to 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) \nor below.   \n \nIf the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.25 mmol/l) in 4 weeks, the dose should be reduced \nby 25 to 50%. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to darbepoetin alfa, r-HuEPO or any of the excipients. \n \nPoorly controlled hypertension.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n354 \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGeneral  \n \nBlood pressure should be monitored in all patients, particularly during initiation of Nespo therapy. If \nblood pressure is difficult to control by initiation of appropriate measures, the haemoglobin may be \nreduced by decreasing or withholding the dose of Nespo (see section 4.2). \n \nIn order to ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron status should be evaluated for all patients prior to and \nduring treatment and supplementary iron therapy may be necessary. \n \nNon-response to therapy with Nespo should prompt a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of \niron, folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and should \ntherefore be corrected. Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, \nhaemolysis, severe aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis \nmay also compromise the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of \nthe evaluation. If typical causes of non-response are excluded, and the patient has reticulocytopenia, \nan examination of the bone marrow should be considered.  If the bone marrow is consistent with \nPRCA, testing for anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be performed. \n \nPure red cell aplasia caused by neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in \nassociation with recombinant erythropoietic proteins, including darbepoetin alfa. This has been \npredominantly reported in patients with CRF treated subcutaneously.  These antibodies have been \nshown to cross-react with all erythropoietic proteins, and patients suspected or confirmed to have \nneutralising antibodies to erythropoietin should not be switched to darbepoetin alfa (see section 4.8). \n \nActive liver disease was an exclusion criteria in all studies of Nespo, therefore no data are available \nfrom patients with impaired liver function. Since the liver is thought to be the principal route of \nelimination of Nespo and r-HuEPO, Nespo should be used with caution in patients with liver disease. \n \nNespo should also be used with caution in those patients with sickle cell anaemia or epilepsy. \n \nMisuse of Nespo by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in packed cell volume. This \nmay be associated with life-threatening complications of the cardiovascular system. \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled pen contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may \ncause allergic reactions. \n \nIn patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the \nupper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2. In clinical studies, an \nincreased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events, and vascular access thrombosis was observed \nwhen erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater \nthan 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l).   \n \nControlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of \nepoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control \nsymptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.  \n \nNespo should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.  Convulsions have been reported in \npatients receiving Nespo. \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nSupplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 100 \u00b5g/l \nor whose transferrin saturation is below 20%.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n355 \n\nIn patients with chronic renal failure and clinical evidence of ischaemic heart disease or congestive \nheart failure, the target haemoglobin should be determined individually.  In these patients an upper \nlimit of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) should be aimed for, unless severe symptoms (e.g. angina) dictate \notherwise. \n \nSerum potassium levels should be monitored regularly during Nespo therapy. Potassium elevation has \nbeen reported in a few patients receiving Nespo, though causality has not been established. If an \nelevated or rising potassium level is observed then consideration should be given to ceasing Nespo \nadministration until the level has been corrected. \n \nCancer patients \n \nEffect on tumour growth \n \nEpoetins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, \nthere is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.  In several controlled studies, \nepoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression \nin patients with anaemia associated with cancer.  \n \nIn controlled clinical studies, use of Nespo and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nshown: \n \n\u2022 shortened time to tumour progression in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving \n\nradiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/dl \n(8.7 mmol/l), ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \n\u2022 shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in \n\npatients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a \nhaemoglobin of 12-14 g/dl (7.5-8.7 mmol/l)  \n\n \n\u2022 increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) in \n\npatients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation \ntherapy.ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population. \n\n \nIn view of the above, in some clinical situations blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment \nfor the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.  The decision to administer recombinant \nerythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual \npatient, which should take into account the specific clinical context.  Factors that should be considered \nin this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage; the degree of anaemia; life-\nexpectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section \n5.1). \n \nIn patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds \n12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in \norder to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.  Platelet counts and haemoglobin level \nshould also be monitored at regular intervals. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of Nespo with other substances.  \nHowever, there is potential for an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. \ncyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If darbepoetin alfa is given concomitantly with any of these drugs, blood \nlevels of these drugs should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n356 \n\n4.6 Pregnancy and lactation \n \nFor Nespo no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal \ndevelopment, parturition or postnatal development. \n \nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n \nAs there is no clinical experience with lactating women Nespo should not be administered to women \nwho are breast-feeding. When Nespo therapy is absolutely indicated women must stop breast-feeding.  \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nThere have been no observed effects with Nespo on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nGeneral \n \nThere have been reports of serious allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, \ndyspnoea, skin rash and urticaria associated with darbepoetin alfa. \n \nClinical Trial Experience \n \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nData presented from controlled studies included 1357 patients, 766 who received Nespo and 591 \npatients who received r-HuEPO. In the Nespo group, 83% were receiving dialysis and 17% were not \nreceiving dialysis. \n \nInjection site pain was reported as attributable to treatment in studies where Nespo was administered \nvia subcutaneous injection. This was seen more frequently than with r-HuEPO. The injection site \ndiscomfort was generally mild and transient in nature and occurred predominantly after the first \ninjection.  \n \nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nCardiac Disorders Very Common (\u2265 1/10) Hypertension \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to \n< 1/100) \n\nThromboembolic Events \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nCancer patients \n \nAdverse reactions were determined based on pooled data from seven randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled studies of Nespo with a total of 2112 patients (Nespo 1200, placebo 912).  Patients \nwith solid tumours (e.g., lung, breast, colon, ovarian cancers) and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., \nlymphoma, multiple myeloma) were enrolled in the clinical studies.  \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n357 \n\nIncidence of undesirable effects considered related to treatment with Nespo from controlled clinical \nstudies are: \n \nMedDRA system organ class Subject Incidence Adverse Drug Reaction \nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue \nDisorders \n\nCommon (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nRash/Erythema \n\nVascular disorders Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nThromboembolic events, \nincluding pulmonary embolism \n\nGeneral Disorders and \nAdministration Site Conditions \n\nVery Common (\u2265 1/10)  Oedema \n\n Common (\u2265 1/100 to \n< 1/10) \n\nInjection site pain \n\n \nPostmarketing Experience \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of Nespo: \n \n\u2022 Pure Red Cell Aplasia. In isolated cases, neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody mediated pure \n\nred cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with Nespo therapy have been reported predominantly in \npatients with CRF treated subcutaneously. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with Nespo must \nbe discontinued and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic \nprotein (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\u2022 Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, skin rash and urticaria. \n \n\u2022 Convulsions. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe therapeutic margin of Nespo is very wide.  Even at very high serum levels, no symptoms of \noverdose have been observed.  \n \nIn the event of polycythaemia, Nespo should be temporarily withheld (see section 4.2). If clinically \nindicated, phlebotomy may be performed. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-anaemic ATC Code: B03XA02. \n \nHuman erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary regulator of \nerythropoiesis through specific interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on the erythroid progenitor \ncells in the bone marrow. The production of erythropoietin primarily occurs in and is regulated by the \nkidney in response to changes in tissue oxygenation. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is \nimpaired in patients with chronic renal failure and the primary cause of their anaemia is due to \nerythropoietin deficiency. In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy the etiology of anaemia is \nmultifactorial. In these patients, erythropoietin deficiency and a reduced response of erythroid \nprogenitor cells to endogenous erythropoietin both contribute significantly towards their anaemia. \n \nDarbepoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as the endogenous hormone. \nDarbepoetin alfa has five N-linked carbohydrate chains whereas the endogenous hormone and \nrecombinant human erythropoietins (r-HuEPO) have three. The additional sugar residues are \nmolecularly indistinct from those on the endogenous hormone. Due to its increased carbohydrate \ncontent darbepoetin alfa has a longer terminal half-life than r-HuEPO and consequently a greater \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n358 \n\nin vivo activity. Despite these molecular changes, darbepoetin alfa retains a very narrow specificity for \nthe erythropoietin receptor. \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 314 lung cancer \npatients receiving platinum containing chemotherapy there was a significant reduction in transfusion \nrequirements (p < 0.001).  \n \nClinical studies have demonstrated that darbepoetin alfa had similar effectiveness when administered \nas a single injection either once every three weeks, once every two weeks, or weekly without any \nincrease in total dose requirements.  \n \nThe safety and effectiveness of once every three weeks dosing of Nespo therapy in reducing the \nrequirement for red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy was assessed in a \nrandomised, double-blind, multinational study. This study was conducted in 705 anaemic patients with \nnon-myeloid malignancies receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive \nNespo at 500 \u03bcg  once every three weeks or 2.25 \u03bcg /kg once weekly. In both groups, the dose was \nreduced by 40% of the previous dose (e.g., for first dose reduction, to 300 \u03bcg  in the once every three \nweeks group and 1.35 \u03bcg /kg in the once weekly group) if haemoglobin increased by more than 1 g/dl \nin a 14-day period. In the once every three weeks group, 72% of patients required dose reductions. In \nthe once weekly group, 75% of patients required dose reductions. This study supports 500 \u03bcg once \nevery three weeks being comparable to once weekly administration with respect to the incidence of \nsubjects receiving at least one red blood cell transfusion from week 5 to the end of treatment phase. \n \nIn a prospective, randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 344 anaemic \npatients with lymphoproliferative malignancies receiving chemotherapy there was a significant \nreduction in transfusion requirements and an improvement in haemoglobin response (p < 0.001). \nImprovement in fatigue, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-fatigue \n(FACT-fatigue) scale, was also observed. \n \nErythropoetin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin \nreceptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. \n \nSurvival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total \nof 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-\nlabel study.  Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.  The \ntarget haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was \n12-14 g/dl.  In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated \nwith recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.  In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard \nratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.  These studies have \nshown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia \nassociated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared \nto controls.  Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences \nin the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human \nerythropoietin and those in the control group. \n \nA systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating \nin 57 clinical trials.  Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of \n1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI: 0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).  \n \nAn increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and \n6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin. There is \ntherefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who \nare treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.  The extent to which these outcomes might apply \nto the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n359 \n\nchemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/dl, is unclear because few patients \nwith these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDue to its increased carbohydrate content the level of darbepoetin alfa in the circulation remains above \nthe minimum stimulatory concentration for erythropoiesis for longer than the equivalent molar dose of \nr-HuEPO, allowing darbepoetin alfa to be administered less frequently to achieve the same biological \nresponse. \n  \nChronic renal failure patients \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa has been studied clinically in chronic renal failure patients \nfollowing intravenous and subcutaneous administration. The terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa is \n21 hours (SD 7.5) when administered intravenously. Clearance of darbepoetin alfa is 1.9 ml/hr/kg \n(SD 0.56) and the volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately equal to plasma volume (50 ml/kg).  \nBioavailability is 37% with subcutaneous administration. Following monthly administration of \ndarbepoetin alfa, at subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 \u00b5g/kg, the terminal half-life was \n73 hours (SD 24).  The longer terminal half-life of darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously \ncompared to intravenously is due to subcutaneous absorption kinetics.  In clinical studies, minimal \naccumulation was observed with either route of administration. In preclinical studies it has been shown \nthat renal clearance is minimal (up to 2% of total clearance), and does not affect the serum half-life.  \n \nData from 809 patients receiving Nespo in European clinical studies were analysed to assess the dose \nrequired to maintain haemoglobin; no difference was observed between the average weekly dose \nadministered via the intravenous or subcutaneous routes of injection.  \n \nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa in paediatric patients (3 to 16 years) with CRF \nwho were either receiving or not receiving dialysis determined pharmacokinetic profiles for sampling \nperiods up to 1 week (168 hours) after a single subcutaneous or intravenous dose. Compared with \npharmacokinetic data from adults with CRF where the same sampling duration was used, the \ncomparison showed that the pharmacokinetics of darbepoetin alfa were similar for paediatric and adult \npatients with CRF.  Following intravenous administration, an approximate 25% difference between \npaediatric and adult patients in the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC[0-\u221e]) was \nobserved; however, this difference was less than the 2-fold range in AUC(0-\u221e) observed for the \npediatricpatients .  AUC(0-\u221e) was similar between adult and paediatric patients with CRF following \nsubcutaneous administration.  Half-life was also similar between adult and paediatric patients with \nCRF following both intravenous and subcutaneous administration.   \n \nCancer patients receiving chemotherapy \n \nFollowing subcutaneous administration of 2.25 \u00b5g/kg to adult cancer patients a mean peak \nconcentration of 10.6 ng/ml (SD 5.9) of darbepoetin alfa was reached at a mean time of 91 hours \n(SD 19.7). These parameters were consistent with dose linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose \nrange (0.5 to 8 \u00b5g/kg weekly and 3 to 9 \u00b5g/kg every two weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters did not \nchange on multiple dosing over 12 weeks (dosing every week or every two weeks).  There was an \nexpected moderate (< 2 fold) increase in serum concentration as steady state was approached, but no \nunexpected accumulation upon repeated administration.  A pharmacokinetic study in patients with \nchemotherapy-induced anaemia treated with 6.75 \u00b5g/kg darbepoetin alfa administered SC every \n3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy was conducted which allowed for full characterisation of \nthe terminal half-life.  In this study, mean (SD) terminal half-life was 74 (SD 27) hours. \n \n5.3  Preclinical safety data \n \nIn all studies in rats and dogs Nespo produced marked increases in haemoglobin, haematocrits, red \nblood cell counts and reticulocytes, which correspond to the expected pharmacological effects. \nAdverse events at very high doses were all considered to be related to an exaggerated pharmacological \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n360 \n\neffect (decreased tissue perfusion due to increased blood viscosity). These included myelofibrosis and \nsplenic hypertrophy as well as broadening of the ECG-QRS complex in dogs but no dysrhythmia and \nno effect on the QT interval were observed. \n \nNespo did not reveal any genotoxic potential nor did it have any effect on the proliferation of non-\nhaematological cells in vitro or in vivo. In the chronic toxicity studies no tumourigenic or unexpected \nmitogenic responses were observed in any tissue type. The carcinogenic potential of darbepoetin alfa \nhas not been evaluated in long-term animal studies. \n \nIn studies performed in rats and rabbits no clinically relevant evidence of harmful effects with respect \nto pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development was observed. \nPlacental transfer was minimal. No alteration of fertility was detected.  \n \n \n6.

Instructions for injecting with the Nespo pre-filled syringe \n \n \n1. WHAT NESPO IS AND WHAT IS IT USED FOR \n \nYour doctor has given you Nespo (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your \nblood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and \nshortness of breath.  \n \nNespo works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is \nproduced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The \nactive substance of Nespo is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary \nCells (CHO-K1).  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure  \n \nNespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney \nfailure) in adults and children.  In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural \nhormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n468 \n\n \nBecause it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks \nbefore you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Nespo to treat \nyour anaemia. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nNespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers \n(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. \n \nOne of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood \ncells. At first, only white blood cells seem to be affected. This is because the red blood cells have a \nmuch longer life span in the circulating blood. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, \nparticularly if you have had a lot of chemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you \nanaemic. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE NESPO \n \nDO NOT use Nespo: \n \n\u2022 if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor; or \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to Nespo (darbepoetin alfa), r-HuEPO or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nNespo. \n \nTake special care with Nespo  \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n \n\u2022 high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n \n\u2022 sickle cell anaemia; \n \n\u2022 epileptic fits (seizures);  \n \n\u2022 convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n \n\u2022 liver disease; \n \n\u2022 significant lack of response to drugs used to treat anaemia; or \n \n\u2022 an allergy to latex (the needle cover on the pre-filled syinge contains a derivative of latex). \n \nSpecial warnings \n \n\u2022 If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that \nthe body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. \nIf you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best \ncourse of action to treat your anaemia.   \n\n \n\u2022 Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dl.   \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n469 \n\n\u2022 If you have chronic renal failure there is an increased risk of serious problems with your heart or \nblood vessels (cardiovascular events) if your haemoglobin is kept too high. \n\n \n\u2022 If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Nespo may act as a blood cell growth factor \n\nand in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer.  Depending on your \nindividual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable.  Please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\u2022 Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. \n \nUsing other medicines \n \nCyclosporin and tacrolimus may be affected by the number of red cells in your blood.  It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking either of these drugs. \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription.   \n \nUsing Nespo with food and drink \n \nFood and drink do not affect Nespo. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nNespo has not been tested in pregnant women.  It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n \n\u2022 are pregnant;  \n \n\u2022 think you may be pregnant; or \n \n\u2022 plan to get pregnant.  \n \nIt is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if \nyou use Nespo. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNespo should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE NESPO  \n \nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Nespo as your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl \nor less. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Nespoin order to maintain a \nhaemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl.  This may vary depending on whether you are an adult or a \nchild.   \n \nInjecting Nespo yourself \n \nYour doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject Nespo.  Your doctor, nurse or \npharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-filled syringe.  Do not try to inject \nyourself if you have not been trained.  Never inject Nespo into a vein yourself.   \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure \n \nNespo is given as a single injection, either once a week, once every two weeks, or once every month \neither under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n470 \n\n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Nespo per kilogram of your body weight will be \neither: \n\u2022 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or \n\u2022 0.45 micrograms once weekly  \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary. \n \nOnce your anaemia is corrected, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood and your \ndose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your anaemia. Your doctor will \ninform you if your dose changes. \n \nYour blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nYour doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a \nvein).  If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will \ntake blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. \n \nIf your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by gene-\ntechnology) to Nespo, they will choose whether you should receive your Nespo injection once weekly \nor once every two weeks.  The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your doctor will tell \nyou how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nNespo is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be \n\u2022 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Nespo per kilogram of your body \n\nweight), or \n\u2022 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Nespo per kilogram of your body weight. \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose as necessary.  Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the \nend of your chemotherapy.  Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Nespo. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nIf you use more Nespo than you should \n \nYou should have no serious problems if you take more Nespo than you need. However, you should \ncontact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen.  If you feel unwell in any way you should \ncontact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to inject Nespo \n \nIf you have forgotten a dose of Nespo, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should \ninject the next dose. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Nespo may cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects have been experienced by some patients taking Nespo: \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n471 \n\nVery Common (seen in more than 10 in 100 people) \n \n\u2022 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\u2022 Fluid retention (oedema) \n \nCommon (seen in more than 1 in 100 people) \n \n\u2022 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\u2022 Pain around the area injected  \n\u2022 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n \nRare (seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people) \n \nSerious allergic reactions which may include: \n\u2022 Sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n\u2022 Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or \n\nbreathing (angioedema) \n\u2022 Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) \n\u2022 Skin rash \n\u2022 Hives (urticaria) \n \nVery rare (seen in less than 1 in 10,000 people) \n \n\u2022 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) \u2013 (anaemia, unusual tiredness, lack of energy) \n \nConvulsions (fits and seizures) have been reported in patients treated with Nespo. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms or you notice any side effects that are not mentioned in this leaflet, \nplease tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE NESPO \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children.  Keep in the original package in order to protect from \nlight. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C).  Do not freeze.  Do not use Nespo if you think it has been frozen. \n \nWhen your syringe has been removed from the refrigerator and left at room temperature for \napproximately 30 minutes before injection it must either be used within 7 days or disposed of. \n \nDo not use Nespo after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the pre-filled pen label \nafter EXP.  The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required.  These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INJECTING WITH THE NESPO PRE-FILLED SYRINGE  \n \nThis section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Nespo.  It is important that \nyou do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist.  If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist \nfor assistance. \n \nHow do you or the person injecting you, use the Nespo pre-filled syringe? \n \nYour doctor has prescribed an Nespo pre-filled syringe for injection into the tissue just under the skin.  \nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will tell you how much Nespo you need and how frequently it \nshould be injected.  \n \nEquipment: \n \nTo give yourself an injection you will need: \n \n\u2022 a new Nespo pre-filled syringe; and \n \n\u2022 alcohol wipes or similar. \n \nWhat should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Nespo? \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n473 \n\n \n1. Remove the pre-filled syringe from the refrigerator. Leave the pre-filled syringe at room \n\ntemperature for approximately 30 minutes.  This will make the injection more comfortable.  Do \nnot warm Nespo in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).  \nAdditionally, do not leave the syringe exposed to direct sunlight. \n\n \n2. Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. \n \n3. Do not remove the cover from the syringe until you are ready to inject. \n \n4. Check that it is the correct dose that your doctor has prescribed. \n \n5. Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP:).  Do not use it if the date has passed \n\nthe last day of the month shown. \n \n6. Check the appearance of Nespo.  It must be a clear, colourless or slightly pearly liquid.  If it is \n\ncloudy or there are particles in it, you must not use it. \n \n7. Wash your hands thoroughly. \n \n8. Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach.  \n \nHow do I prepare my Nespo injection? \n \nBefore you inject Nespo you must do the following: \n \n1. To avoid bending the needle, gently pull the cover from the needle \n\nwithout twisting as shown in pictures 1 and 2.   \n2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. \n3. You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do \n\nnot have to remove the air bubble before injecting. Injecting the \nsolution with the air bubble is harmless. \n\n4. You can now use the pre-filled syringe. \n \nWhere should I give my injection? \n\n \nThe best places to inject yourself arethe top of your thighs andthe abdomen. If \nsomeone else is injecting for you, they can also use the back of your arms. \n \nYou may change the injection site if you notice the area is red or sore.  \n \nHow do I give my injection? \n \n\n1. Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch (without squeezing) the skin between \nyour thumb and forefinger. \n\n \n2. Put the needle fully into the skin as shown by your nurse or doctor. \n \n3. Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured.  If you see \n\nblood in the syringe, pull the needle out and re-insert it in another place. \n \n4. Push the plunger with a slow constant pressure, always keeping your skin pinched, until the \n\nsyringe is empty. \n \n5. Remove the needle and let go of your skin. \n \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n474 \n\n6. If you notice a spot of blood you may gently dab it away with a cotton ball or tissue.  Do not rub \nthe injection site.  If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster. \n\n \n7. Only use each syringe for one injection.  Do not use any Nespo that is left in the syringe. \n \nRemember:  If you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help \nand advice. \n \nDisposing of used syringes \n \n\u2022 Do not put the cover back on used needles, as you may accidentally prick yourself. \n\u2022 Keep used syringes out of the reach and sight of children. \n\u2022 The used pre-filled syringe should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

BEFORE YOU USE NESPO \n \nDO NOT use Nespo: \n \n\u2022 if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor; or \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to Nespo (darbepoetin alfa), r-HuEPO or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nNespo. \n \nTake special care with Nespo  \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n \n\u2022 high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n \n\u2022 sickle cell anaemia; \n \n\u2022 epileptic fits (seizures);  \n \n\u2022 convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n \n\u2022 liver disease; \n \n\u2022 significant lack of response to drugs used to treat anaemia; or \n \nSpecial warnings \n \n\u2022 If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients. PRCA means that \nthe body has stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells which causes severe anaemia. \nIf you experience these symptoms you should contact your doctor who will determine the best \ncourse of action to treat your anaemia.   \n\n \n\u2022 Your doctor should try to keep your haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dl.   \n \n\u2022 If you have chronic renal failure there is an increased risk of serious problems with your heart or \n\nblood vessels (cardiovascular events) if your haemoglobin is kept too high. \n \n\u2022 If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Nespo may act as a blood cell growth factor \n\nand in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer.  Depending on your \nindividual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable.  Please discuss this with your doctor. \n\n \n\u2022 Misuse by healthy people can cause life-threatening problems with the heart or blood vessels. \n \nUsing other medicines \n \nCyclosporin and tacrolimus may be affected by the number of red cells in your blood.  It is important \nto tell your doctor if you are taking either of these drugs. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n477 \n\n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including \nmedicines obtained without a prescription.   \n \nUsing Nespo with food and drink \n \nFood and drink do not affect Nespo. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nNespo has not been tested in pregnant women.  It is important to tell your doctor if you: \n \n\u2022 are pregnant;  \n \n\u2022 think you may be pregnant; or \n \n\u2022 plan to get pregnant.  \n \nIt is not known whether darbepoetin alfa is excreted in human milk. You must stop breast-feeding if \nyou use Nespo. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNespo should not affect your ability to drive or use machinery. \n \n \n3. HOW TO USE NESPO  \n \nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Nespo as your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl \nor less. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Nespoin order to maintain a \nhaemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl.  This may vary depending on whether you are an adult or a \nchild.   \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure \n \nNespo is given as a single injection, either once a week, once every two weeks, or once every month \neither under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of Nespo per kilogram of your body weight will be \neither: \n\u2022 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or \n\u2022 0.45 micrograms once weekly  \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary. \n \nOnce your anaemia is corrected, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood and your \ndose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your anaemia. Your doctor will \ninform you if your dose changes. \n \nYour blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nYour doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a \nvein).  If this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will \ntake blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n478 \n\n \nIf your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-HuEPO (erythropoietin produced by gene-\ntechnology) to Nespo, they will choose whether you should receive your Nespo injection once weekly \nor once every two weeks.  The route of injection is the same as with r-HuEPO but your doctor will tell \nyou how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nNespo is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin.  \n \nIn order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be \n\u2022 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of Nespo per kilogram of your body \n\nweight), or \n\u2022 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of Nespo per kilogram of your body weight. \nYour doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may \nadjust your dose as necessary.  Your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the \nend of your chemotherapy.  Your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking Nespo. \n \nIn some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. \n \nIf you use more Nespo than you should \n \nYou should have no serious problems if you take more Nespo than you need. However, you should \ncontact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen.  If you feel unwell in any way you should \ncontact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. \n \nIf you forget to inject Nespo \n \nIf you have forgotten a dose of Nespo, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should \ninject the next dose. \n \n \n4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS \n \nLike all medicines, Nespo may cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nThe following side effects have been experienced by some patients taking Nespo: \n \nVery Common (seen in more than 10 in 100 people) \n \n\u2022 High blood pressure (hypertension) \n\u2022 Fluid retention (oedema) \n \nCommon (seen in more than 1 in 100 people) \n \n\u2022 Blood clots (thrombosis) \n\u2022 Pain around the area injected  \n\u2022 Rash and/or redness of the skin \n \nRare (seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people) \n \nSerious allergic reactions which may include: \n\u2022 Sudden life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n\u2022 Swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or \n\nbreathing (angioedema) \n\u2022 Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n479 \n\n\u2022 Skin rash \n\u2022 Hives (urticaria) \n \nVery rare (seen in less than 1 in 10,000 people) \n \n\u2022 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) \u2013 (anaemia, unusual tiredness, lack of energy) \n \nConvulsions (fits and seizures) have been reported in patients treated with Nespo. \n \nIf you have any of these symptoms or you notice any side effects that are not mentioned in this leaflet, \nplease tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \n \n5. HOW TO STORE NESPO \n \nKeep out of the reach and sight of children.  Keep in the original package in order to protect from \nlight. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C).  Do not freeze.  Do not use Nespo if you think it has been frozen. \n \nWhen your vial has been removed from the refrigerator and left at room temperature for approximately \n30 minutes before injection it must either be used within 7 days or disposed of. \n \nDo not use Nespo after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the pre-filled pen label \nafter EXP.  The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n \nMedicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \ndispose of medicines no longer required.  These measures will help to protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

Instructions for injecting with the Nespo pre-filled pen  \n \n \n1. WHAT NESPO IS AND WHAT IS IT USED FOR \n \nYour doctor has given you Nespo (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. Anaemia is when your \nblood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and \nshortness of breath.  \n \nNespo works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is \nproduced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The \nactive substance of Nespo is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary \nCells (CHO-K1).  \n \nIf you have chronic renal failure  \n \nNespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney \nfailure) in adults and children.  In kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural \nhormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia.  \n\n\n\nMe\ndic\n\nina\nl p\n\nrod\nuc\n\nt n\no l\n\non\nge\n\nr a\nuth\n\nori\nse\n\nd\n\n482 \n\n \nBecause it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks \nbefore you notice any effect. Your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of Nespo to treat \nyour anaemia. \n \nIf you are receiving chemotherapy \n \nNespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers \n(non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. \n \nOne of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood \ncells. At first, only white blood cells seem to be affected. This is because the red blood cells have a \nmuch longer life span in the circulating blood. Towards the end of your chemotherapy course, \nparticularly if you have had a lot of chemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you \nanaemic. \n \n \n2. BEFORE YOU USE NESPO \n \nDO NOT use Nespo: \n \n\u2022 if you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure which is not being controlled with other \n\nmedicines prescribed by your doctor; or \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to Nespo (darbepoetin alfa), r-HuEPO or to any of the other ingredients in \n\nNespo. \n \nTake special care with Nespo  \n \nPlease tell your doctor if you are suffering or have suffered from: \n \n\u2022 high blood pressure which is being controlled with medicines prescribed by your doctor; \n \n\u2022 sickle cell anaemia; \n \n\u2022 epileptic fits (seizures);  \n \n\u2022 convulsions (fits or seizures);  \n \n\u2022 liver disease; \n \n\u2022 significant lack of response to drugs used to treat anaemia; or \n \n\u2022 an allergy to latex (the needle cover on the pre-filled pen contains a derivative of latex). \n \nSpecial warnings \n \n\u2022 If you have symptoms which include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy this could mean \n\nyou have pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), which has been reported in patients.

HOW TO USE THE NESPO PRE-FILLED PEN (SURECLICK) \n \nFollowing blood tests, your doctor has decided you need Nespo as your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl \nor less. Your injection is to be given under the skin (subcutaneous), and so you may use the Nespo \npre-filled pen. Your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take Nespoin order to \nmaintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl.  This may vary depending on whether you are \nan adult or a child.  \n \nInjecting Nespo yourself \n \nYour doctor has decided that the Nespo pre-filled pen is the best way for you, a nurse, or a carer to \ninject Nespo.  Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-\nfilled pen.  Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained.  Never inject Nespo into a vein \nyourself.

Instructions for alternate injection sites  \n \nWhen using alternate injection sites, it is particularly important to create enough surface tension on the \nsite to be able to successfully complete the injection. \n \n\n  \nStretch technique \n \nMake sure that skin under and around the pre-filled pen is firm and \ntight to provide enough resistance to fully retract the safety guard \nand \u201cunlock\u201d the pen. \n\n \n \n\nYou can use the abdomen, except for the 2 inch/5 cm area around the \nbelly button (navel). For the abdomen, it is recommended to lie down on \nyour back, and stretch the skin at the injection site to create a firm and \ntight surface. \n\n \n\nIf someone else is giving you the injection, they can also use the outer \narea of the upper arms. For the upper arms, it is recommended to \nstretch the skin at the injection site to create a firm and tight surface.  \n\n \n3. Prepare the site \n \nTo prepare the area of skin where Nespo will be injected, wipe the injection site with an alcohol wipe.  \nDo not touch this area again before giving the injection. \n \n7b.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what nespo is and what is it used for", "Section_Content": "your doctor has given you nespo (an anti-anaemic) to treat your anaemia. anaemia is when your blood does not contain enough red blood cells and the symptoms may be fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath. nespo works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin. erythropoietin is produced in your kidneys and encourages your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. the active substance of nespo is darbepoetin alfa produced by gene-technology in chinese hamster ovary cells (cho-k1). if you have chronic renal failure nespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia that is associated with chronic renal failure (kidney failure) in adults and children. in kidney failure, the kidney does not produce enough of the natural hormone erythropoietin which can often cause anaemia. because it will take your body some time to make more red blood cells, it will be about four weeks before you notice any effect. your normal dialysis routine will not affect the ability of nespo to treat your anaemia. if you are receiving chemotherapy nespo is used to treat symptomatic anaemia in adult cancer patients with non-bone marrow cancers (non-myeloid malignancies) who are receiving chemotherapy. one of the main side effects of chemotherapy is that it stops the bone marrow producing enough blood cells. at first, only white blood cells seem to be affected. this is because the red blood cells have a much longer life span in the circulating blood. towards the end of your chemotherapy course, particularly if you have had a lot of chemotherapy, your red blood cell count may fall making you anaemic.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "nespo", "Type":

your doctor has decided you need nespo as your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl or less. your doctor will tell you how much and how often you must take nespoin order to maintain a haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl. this may vary depending on whether you are an adult or a child. injecting nespo yourself your doctor may decide that it is best for you or a carer to inject nespo. your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will show you how to inject yourself with the pre-filled syringe. do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained. never inject nespo into a vein yourself. if you have chronic renal failure nespo is given as a single injection, either once a week, once every two weeks, or once every month either under your skin (subcutaneous) or into a vein (intravenous). in order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose of nespo per kilogram of your body weight will be either: 0.75 micrograms once every two weeks, or 0.45 micrograms once weekly your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may adjust your dose once every four weeks as necessary. once your anaemia is corrected, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood and your dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your anaemia. your doctor will inform you if your dose changes. your blood pressure will also be checked regularly, particularly at the beginning of your treatment. in some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. your doctor may decide to change the way that your injection is given (either under the skin or into a vein). if this changes you will start on the same dose as you have been receiving and your doctor will take blood samples to make sure that your anaemia is still being managed correctly. if your doctor has decided to change your treatment from r-huepo (erythropoietin produced by gene- technology) to nespo, they will choose whether you should receive your nespo injection once weekly or once every two weeks. the route of injection is the same as with r-huepo but your doctor will tell you how much you should take, and when, and may adjust your dose if necessary. if you are receiving chemotherapy nespo is given as a single injection, either once a week or once every three weeks, under your skin. in order to correct your anaemia, your initial dose will be 500 micrograms once every three weeks (6.75 micrograms of nespo per kilogram of your body weight), or 2.25 micrograms (once weekly) of nespo per kilogram of your body weight. your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your anaemia is responding and may adjust your dose as necessary. your treatment will continue until approximately four weeks after the end of your chemotherapy. your doctor will tell you exactly when to stop taking nespo. in some cases, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. if you use more nespo than you should you should have no serious problems if you take more nespo than you need. however, you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if this does happen. if you feel unwell in any way you should contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist immediately. if you forget to inject nespo if you have forgotten a dose of nespo, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose.",
