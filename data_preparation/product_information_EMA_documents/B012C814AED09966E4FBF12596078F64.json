NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nDexdor 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach 1 ml of concentrate contains dexmedetomidine hydrochloride equivalent to 100 micrograms \ndexmedetomidine. \n\nEach 2 ml ampoule contains 200 micrograms of dexmedetomidine.\nEach 2 ml vial contains 200 micrograms of dexmedetomidine.\nEach 4 ml vial contains 400 micrograms of dexmedetomidine.\nEach 10 ml vial contains 1000 micrograms of dexmedetomidine.\n\nThe concentration of the final solution after dilution should be either 4 micrograms/ml or 8 \nmicrograms/ml. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nConcentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). \n\nThe concentrate is a clear, colourless solution, pH 4.5 – 7.0\n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nFor sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not deeper than \narousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale \n(RASS) 0 to -3).\n\nFor sedation of non-intubated adult patients prior to and/or during diagnostic or surgical procedures \nrequiring sedation, i.e. procedural/awake sedation.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nFor sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not deeper \nthan arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation \nScale (RASS) 0 to -3).\n\nFor hospital use only. Dexdor should be administered by healthcare professionals skilled in the \nmanagement of patients requiring intensive care.\n\nPosology\n\nPatients already intubated and sedated may switch to dexmedetomidine with an initial infusion rate of\n0.7 micrograms/kg/h which may then be adjusted stepwise within the dose range 0.2 to \n1.4 micrograms/kg/h in order to achieve the desired level of sedation, depending on the patient’s \nresponse. A lower starting infusion rate should be considered for frail patients. Dexmedetomidine is \nvery potent and the infusion rate is given per hour. After dose adjustment, a new steady state sedation \nlevel may not be reached for up to one hour.\n\n\n\n3\n\nMaximum dose\n\nThe maximum dose of 1.4 micrograms/kg/h should not be exceeded. Patients failing to achieve an \nadequate level of sedation with the maximum dose of dexmedetomidine should be switched to an \nalternative sedative agent.\n\nUse of a loading dose of Dexdor in ICU sedation is not recommended and is associated with increased \nadverse reactions. Propofol or midazolam may be administered if needed until clinical effects of \ndexmedetomidine are established. \n\nDuration\n\nThere is no experience in the use of Dexdor for more than 14 days. The use of Dexdor for longer than \nthis period should be regularly reassessed.\n\nFor sedation of non-intubated adult patients prior to and/or during diagnostic or surgical \nprocedures requiring sedation, i.e. procedural/awake sedation.\n\nDexdor should be administered only by health care professionals skilled in the anaesthetic \nmanagement of patients in the operating room or during diagnostic procedures. When Dexdor is \nadministered for conscious sedation, patients should be continuously monitored by persons not \ninvolved in the conduct of the diagnostic or surgical procedure. Patients should be monitored \ncontinuously for early signs of hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, airway \nobstruction, apnoea, dyspnoea and/or oxygen desaturation (see section 4.8).\n\nSupplemental oxygen should be immediately available and provided when indicated. The oxygen \nsaturation should be monitored by pulse oximetry.\n\nDexdor is given as a loading infusion followed by maintenance infusion. Depending on the procedure \nconcomitant local anaesthesia or analgesia may be needed in order to achieve the desired clinical \neffect. Additional analgesia or sedatives (e.g. opioids, midazolam, or propofol) are recommended in \ncase of painful procedures or if increased depth of sedation is necessary. The pharmacokinetic \ndistribution half –life of Dexdor has been estimated to be around 6 min, which can be taken into \nconsideration, together with the effects of other administered medications, when assessing the \nappropriate time needed for titration to desired clinical effect of Dexdor.\n\nInitiation of Procedural Sedation:\n\n- A loading infusion of 1.0 microgram/kg over 10 minutes. For less invasive procedures such as \nophthalmic surgery, a loading infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg given over 10 minutes may be \nsuitable.\n\nMaintenance of Procedural Sedation:\n\n- The maintenance infusion is generally initiated at 0.6-0.7 microgram/kg/hour and titrated to \nachieve desired clinical effect with doses ranging from 0.2 to 1 microgram/kg/hour. The rate of \nthe maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the targeted level of sedation.\n\nSpecial populations\n\nElderly\n\nNo dose adjustment is normally required for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Elderly patients appear \nto have an increased risk for hypotension (see section 4.4) but the limited data available from \nprocedural sedation do not suggest a clear dose dependency.\n\n\n\n4\n\nRenal impairment\n\nNo dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment.\n\nHepatic impairment\n\nDexmedetomidine is metabolised in the liver and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. A reduced maintenance dose may be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).\n\nPaediatric population\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dexdor in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade.\n\nMethod of administration \n\nDexdor must be administered only as a diluted intravenous infusion using a controlled infusion device. \nFor instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nAdvanced heart block (grade 2 or 3) unless paced.\n\nUncontrolled hypotension.\n\nAcute cerebrovascular conditions.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nMonitoring\n\nDexdor is intended for use in an intensive care setting, operating room and during diagnostic \nprocedures. The use in other environments is not recommended. All patients should have continuous \ncardiac monitoring during Dexdor infusion. Respiration should be monitored in non-intubated patients\ndue to the risk of respiratory depression and in some case apnoea (see section 4.8).\n\nThe time to recovery after the use of dexmedetomidine was reported to be approximately one hour. \nWhen used in an outpatient setting close monitoring should continue for at least one hour (or longer \nbased on the patient condition), with medical supervision continued for at least one further hour to \nensure the safety of the patient.\n\nGeneral precautions\n\nDexdor should not be given as a bolus dose and in the ICU a loading dose is not recommended. Users \nshould therefore be ready to use an alternative sedative for acute control of agitation or during \nprocedures, especially during the first few hours of treatment. During procedural sedation a small \nbolus of another sedative may be used if a rapid increase in sedation level is required.\nSome patients receiving Dexdor have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This \nalone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs \nand symptoms.\n\n\n\n5\n\nDexmedetomidine normally does not cause deep sedation and patients may be easily roused. \nDexmedetomidine is therefore not suitable in patients who will not tolerate this profile of effects, for \nexample those requiring continuous deep sedation.\n\nDexdor should not be used as a general anaesthetic induction agent for intubation or to provide \nsedation during muscle relaxant use.\n\nDexmedetomidine lacks the anticonvulsant action of some other sedatives and so will not suppress \nunderlying seizure activity.\n\nCare should be taken if combining dexmedetomidine with other substances with sedative or \ncardiovascular actions as additive effects may occur.\n\nDexdor is not recommended for patient controlled sedation. Adequate data is not available.\n\nWhen Dexdor is used in an outpatient setting patients should normally be discharged into the care of a \nsuitable third party. Patients should be advised to refrain from driving or other hazardous tasks and \nwhere possible to avoid the use of other agents that may sedate (e.g, benzodiazepines, opioids, \nalcohol) for a suitable period of time based on observed effects of dexmedetomidine, the procedure, \nconcomitant medications, the age and the condition of the patient.\n\nCaution should be exercised when administering dexmedetomidine to elderly patients. Elderly patients \nover 65 years of age may be more prone to hypotension with the administration of dexmedetomidine, \nincluding a loading dose, for procedures. A dose reduction should be considered. Please refer to \nsection 4.2.\n\nCardio-vascular effects and precautions\n\nDexmedetomidine reduces heart rate and blood pressure through central sympatholysis but at higher \nconcentrations causes peripheral vasoconstriction leading to hypertension (see section 5.1).\nDexmedetomidine is therefore not suitable in patients with severe cardiovascular instability. \n\nCaution should be exercised when administering dexmedetomidine to patients with pre-existing \nbradycardia. Data on the effects of Dexdor in patients with heart rate <60 are very limited and \nparticular care should be taken with such patients. Bradycardia does not normally require treatment,\nbut has commonly responded to anti-cholinergic medicine or dose reduction where needed. Patients \nwith high physical fitness and slow resting heart rate may be particularly sensitive to bradycardic \neffects of alpha-2 receptor agonists and cases of transient sinus arrest have been reported. Also cases \nof cardiac arrest, often preceded by bradycardia or atrioventricular block, have been reported (see \nsection 4.8).\n\nThe hypotensive effects of dexmedetomidine may be of greater significance in those patients with pre-\nexisting hypotension (especially if not responsive to vasopressors), hypovolaemia, chronic \nhypotension or reduced functional reserve such as patients with severe ventricular dysfunction and the \nelderly and special care is warranted in these cases (see section 4.3). Hypotension does not normally \nrequire specific treatment but, where needed, users should be ready to intervene with dose reduction, \nfluids and/or vasoconstrictors .\n\nPatients with impaired peripheral autonomic activity (e.g. due to spinal cord injury) may have more \npronounced haemodynamic changes after starting dexmedetomidine and so should be treated with \ncare.\n\nTransient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the \nperipheral vasoconstrictive effects of dexmedetomidine and a loading dose is not recommended in \nICU sedation. Treatment of hypertension has generally not been necessary but decreasing the \ncontinuous infusion rate may be advisable.\n\n\n\n6\n\nLocal vasoconstriction at higher concentration may be of greater significance in patients with \nischaemic heart disease or severe cerebrovascular disease who should be monitored closely. Dose \nreduction or discontinuation should be considered in a patient developing signs of myocardial or \ncerebral ischaemia.\n\nCaution is advised when administering dexmedetomidine together with spinal or epidural anaesthesia \ndue to possible increased risk of hypotension or bradycardia. \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment\n\nCare should be taken in severe hepatic impairment as excessive dosing may increase the risk of \nadverse reactions, over-sedation or prolonged effect as a result of reduced dexmedetomidine clearance.\n\nPatients with neurological disorders\n\nExperience of dexmedetomidine in severe neurological disorders such as head injury and after \nneurosurgery is limited and it should be used with caution here, especially if deep sedation is required. \nDexmedetomidine may reduce cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure and this should be \nconsidered when selecting therapy.\n\nOther\n\nAlpha-2 agonists have rarely been associated with withdrawal reactions when stopped abruptly after \nprolonged use. This possibility should be considered if the patient develops agitation and hypertension \nshortly after stopping dexmedetomidine.\n\nDexmedetomidine may induce hyperthermia that may be resistant to traditional cooling methods. \nDexmedetomidine treatment should be discontinued in the event of a sustained unexplained fever and \nis not recommended for use in malignant hyperthermia-sensitive patients.\n\nDexdor contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml.\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults.\n\nCo-administration of dexmedetomidine with anaesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to \nlead to an enhancement of effects, including sedative, anaesthetic and cardiorespiratory effects. \nSpecific studies have confirmed enhanced effects with isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. \n\nNo pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and \nmidazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when \nco-administered with dexmedetomidine, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine or the concomitant \nanaesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.\n\nInhibition of CYP enzymes including CYP2B6 by dexmedetomidine has been studied in human liver \nmicrosome incubations. In vitro study suggests that interaction potential in vivo exists between \ndexmedetomidine and substrates with dominant CYP2B6 metabolism.\n\nInduction of dexmedetomidine in vitro was observed on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and \nCYP3A4, and induction in vivo cannot be excluded. The clinical significance is unknown.\n\nThe possibility of enhanced hypotensive and bradycardic effects should be considered in patients \nreceiving other medicinal products causing these effects, for example beta blockers, although \nadditional effects in an interaction study with esmolol were modest.\n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation\n\n\n\n7\n\nPregnancy\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of dexmedetomidine in pregnant women. \n\nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Dexdor should not be used \nduring pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with \ndexmedetomidine.\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nDexmedetomidine is excreted in human milk, however levels will be below the limit of detection by \n24 hours following treatment discontinuation. A risk to infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be \nmade whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue dexmedetomidine therapy taking into \naccount the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\n\nFertility\n\nIn the rat fertility study, dexmedetomidine had no effect on male or female fertility. No human data on \nfertility are available.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nPatients should be advised to refrain from driving or other hazardous tasks for a suitable period of time \nafter receiving Dexdor for procedural sedation.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\nSummary of the safety profile\n\nSedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with dexmedetomidine in ICU setting are hypotension, \nhypertension and bradycardia, occurring in approximately 25%, 15% and 13% of patients respectively. \nHypotension and bradycardia were also the most frequent dexmedetomidine-related serious adverse \nreactions occurring in 1.7% and 0.9% of randomised Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients respectively.\n\nProcedural/awake sedation \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with dexmedetomidine in procedural sedation are \nlisted below (the protocols of phase III studies contained pre-defined thresholds for reporting changes \nin blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate as AEs).\n- Hypotension (55 % in dexmedetomidine-group vs. 30 % in placebo-group receiving rescue\n\nmidazolam and fentanyl)\n- Respiratory depression ( 38 % in dexmedetomidine-group vs. 35 % in placebo-group receiving \n\nrescue midazolam and fentanyl)\n- Bradycardia (14 % in dexmedetomidine-group vs. 4 % in placebo-group receiving rescue \n\nmidazolam and fentanyl)\n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\nThe adverse reactions listed in Table 1 have been accumulated from pooled data of clinical trials in \nintensive care.\n\nAdverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following \nconvention: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000).\n\n\n\n8\n\nTable 1.

The symptoms responded to leg raising and anticholinergics such as \natropine or glycopyrrolate. In isolated cases bradycardia has progressed to periods of asystole in \npatients with pre-existing bradycardia. Also cases of cardiac arrest, often preceded by bradycardia or \natrioventricular block, have been reported.\n\nHypertension has been associated with the use of a loading dose and this reaction can be reduced by \navoiding such a loading dose or reducing the infusion rate or size of the loading dose.\n\nPaediatric population\n\nChildren > 1 month post-natal, predominantly post-operative, have been evaluated for treatment up to \n24 hours in the ICU and demonstrated a similar safety profile as in adults. Data in new-born infants \n\n\n\n9\n\n(28 – 44 weeks gestation) is very limited and restricted to maintenance doses ≤ 0.2 mcg/kg/h. A single \ncase of hypothermic bradycardia in a neonate has been reported in the literature.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nSymptoms\n\nSeveral cases of dexmedetomidine overdose have been reported both in the clinical trial and the post-\nmarketing data. The reported highest infusion rates of dexmedetomidine in these cases have reached \nup to 60 µg/kg/h for 36 minutes and 30 µg/kg/h for 15 minutes in a 20-month-old child and in an \nadult, respectively. The most common adverse reactions reported in conjunction with overdose include\nbradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, oversedation, respiratory depression and cardiac arrest.\n\nManagement\n\nIn cases of overdose with clinical symptoms, dexmedetomidine infusion should be reduced or stopped. \nExpected effects are primarily cardiovascular and should be treated as clinically indicated (see section \n4.4). At high concentration hypertension may be more prominent than hypotension. In clinical studies, \ncases of sinus arrest reversed spontaneously or responded to treatment with atropine and \nglycopyrrolate. Resuscitation was required in isolated cases of severe overdose resulting in cardiac \narrest. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other hypnotics and sedatives, ATC code: N05CM18\n\nDexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with a broad range of pharmacological \nproperties. It has a sympatholytic effect through decrease of the release of noradrenaline in \nsympathetic nerve endings. The sedative effects are mediated through decreased firing of locus \ncoeruleus, the predominant noradrenergic nucleus, situated in the brainstem. Dexmedetomidine has \nanalgesic and anaesthetic/analgesic-sparing effects. The cardiovascular effects depend on the dose; \nwith lower infusion rates the central effects dominate leading to decrease in heart rate and blood \npressure. With higher doses, peripheral vasoconstricting effects prevail leading to an increase in \nsystemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, while the bradycardic effect is further emphasised.\nDexmedetomidine is relatively free from respiratory depressive effects when given as monotherapy to \nhealthy subjects.\n\nSedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients\n\nIn placebo controlled trials in a post-operative ICU population previously intubated and sedated with \nmidazolam or propofol, Dexdor significantly reduced the requirement for both rescue sedative \n(midazolam or propofol) and opioids during sedation for up to 24 hours. Most dexmedetomidine \npatients required no additional sedative treatment. Patients could be successfully extubated without \nstopping the Dexdor infusion. Studies from outside the ICU have confirmed that Dexdor can be \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10\n\nadministered safely to patients without endotracheal intubation provided adequate monitoring is in \nplace.\n\nDexmedetomidine was similar to midazolam (Ratio 1.07; 95% CI 0.971, 1.176) and propofol (Ratio \n1.00; 95% CI 0.922, 1.075) on the time in target sedation range in a predominently medical population \nrequiring prolonged light to moderate sedation (RASS 0 to -3) in the ICU for up to 14 days, reduced \nthe duration of mechanical ventilation compared to midazolam and reduced the time to extubation \ncompared to midazolam and propofol. Compared to both propofol and midazolam, patients were more \neasily roused, more cooperative and better able to communicate whether or not they had pain. \nDexmedetomidine treated patients had more frequent hypotension and bradycardia but less tachycardia \nthan those receiving midazolam and more frequent tachycardia but similar hypotension to propofol-\ntreated patients. Delirium measured by the CAM-ICU scale was reduced in a study compared to \nmidazolam and delirium-related adverse events were lower on dexmedetomidine compared to \npropofol. Those patients who withdrew due to insufficient sedation were switched to either propofol or \nmidazolam. The risk of insufficient sedation was increased in patients who were difficult to sedate \nwith standard care immediately prior to switching.\n\nEvidence of paediatric efficacy was seen in a dose-controlled ICU study in a largely post-operative \npopulation aged 1 month to ≤ 17 years. Approximately 50% of patients treated with dexmedetomidine \ndid not require rescue addition of midazolam during a median treatment period of 20.3 hours, not \nexceeding 24 hours. Data on treatment for > 24 hours is not available. Data in new-born infants (28 –\n44 weeks gestation) is very limited and restricted to low doses (≤ 0.2 mcg/kg/h) (see sections 5.2 and \n4.4). New-born infants may be particularly sensitive to the bradycardic effects of Dexdor in the \npresence of hypothermia and in conditions of heart rate-dependent cardiac output. \n\nIn double blind comparator controlled ICU studies the incidence of cortisol suppression in patients \ntreated with dexmedetomidine (n=778) was 0.5% compared with 0% in patients treated with either \nmidazolam (n=338) or propofol (n=275). The event was reported as mild in 1 and moderate in 3 cases.\n\nProcedural/awake sedation\n\nThe safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or \nduring surgical and diagnostic procedures was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled multicentre clinical trials.\n\n Study 1 randomised patients undergoing elective surgeries/procedures under monitored \nanaesthesia care and local/regional anaesthesia to receive a loading infusion of \ndexmedetomidine either 1 µg/kg (n=129) or 0.5 µg/kg (n=134), or placebo (normal saline; \nn=63) given over 10 minutes and followed by a maintenance infusion started at 0.6 µg/kg/h. \nThe maintenance infusion of study drug could be titrated from 0.2 µg/kg/h to 1 µg/kg/h. The \nproportion of patients that achieved the targeted sedation level (Observer’s Assessment of \nAlertness/Sedation Scale ≤4) without need for rescue midazolam was 54% of the patients \nreceiving dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg and 40% of the patients receiving dexmedetomidine 0.5 \nµg/kg compared to 3% of patients receiving the placebo.The risk difference in proportion of \nsubjects randomised to dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg group and dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg \ngroup not requiring rescue midazolam was 48% (95% CI: 37 % - 57%) and 40% (95% CI: \n28% - 48%), respectively compared placebo. The median (range) midazolam rescue dose was \n1.5 (0.5-7.0) mg in the dexmedetomidine1.0 µg/kg group, 2.0 (0.5-8.0) mg in the \ndexmedetomidine 0.5 µg/kg group, and 4.0 (0.5-14.0) mg in the placebo group. The \ndifference in means in dose of rescue midazolam in dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg and \ndexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg group compared to placebo was -3.1 mg (95% CI: -3.8 - -2.5)\nand -2.7 mg (95% CI: -3.3 - -2.1), respectively favouring dexmedetomidine.The median time \nto first rescue dose was 114 minutes in the dexmedetomidine 1.0 µg/kg group, 40 minutes in \nthe dexmedetomidine 0.5 µg/kg group, and 20 minutes in the placebo group.  \n\n Study 2 randomised patients undergoing awake fibreoptic intubation under topical anaesthesia \nto receive a loading infusion of dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg (n=55) or placebo (normal saline) \n\n\n\n11\n\n(n=50) given over 10 minutes and followed by a fixed maintenance infusion of 0.7 µg/kg/h. \nTo maintain a Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥2 53% of the patients receiving dexmedetomidine did \nnot require midazoloam rescue vs. 14% of patients receiving placebo. The risk difference in \nproportion of subjects randomised to dexmedetomidine not requiring rescue midazolam was \n43% (95% CI: 23 % - 57%) compared placebo. The mean midazolam rescue dose was 1.1\nmg in the dexmedetomidine group, and 2.8 mg in the placebo group. The difference in means \nin dose of rescue midazolam was -1.8 mg (95% CI: -2.7 - -0.86) favouring dexmedetomidine.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine has been assessed following short term IV administration \nin healthy volunteers and long term infusion in ICU population. \n\nDistribution\n\nDexmedetomidine exhibits a two-compartment disposition model. In healthy volunteers it exhibits a \nrapid distribution phase with a central estimate of the distribution half-life (t1/2α) of about 6 minutes. \nThe mean estimate of the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) is approximately 1.9 to 2.5 h (min 1.35, \nmax 3.68 h) and the mean estimate of the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately \n1.16 to 2.16 l/kg (90 to 151 litres). Plasma clearance (Cl) has a mean estimated value of 0.46 to \n0.73 l/h/kg (35.7 to 51.1 l/h). The mean body weight associated with these Vss and Cl estimates was \n69 kg. Plasma pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine is similar in the ICU population following \ninfusion >24 h. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters are: t1/2 approximately 1.5 hours, Vss \napproximately 93 litres and Cl approximately 43 l/h. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine is \nlinear in the dosing range from 0.2 to 1.4 µg/kg/h and it does not accumulate in treatments lasting up \nto 14 days. Dexmedetomidine is 94% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant \nover the concentration range of 0.85 to 85 ng/ml. Dexmedetomidine binds to both human serum \nalbumin and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein with serum albumin as the major binding protein of \ndexmedetomidine in plasma. \n\nBiotransformation and Elimination\n\nDexmedetomidine is eliminated by extensive metabolism in the liver. There are three types of initial \nmetabolic reactions; direct N-glucuronidation, direct N-methylation and cytochrome P450 catalysed \noxidation. The most abundant circulating dexmedetomidine metabolites are two isomeric N-\nglucuronides. Metabolite H-1, N-methyl 3-hydroxymethyl dexmedetomidine O-glucuronide, is also a \nmajor circulating product of dexmedetomidine biotransformation. Cytochrome P-450 catalyses the \nformation of two minor circulating metabolites, 3-hydroxymethyl dexmedetomidine produced by \nhydroxylation at the 3-methyl group of dexmedetomidine and H-3 produced by oxidation in the \nimidazole ring. Available data suggest that the formation of the oxidised metabolites is mediated by \nseveral CYP forms (CYP2A6, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19). These metabolites have \nnegligible pharmacological activity. \n\nFollowing IV administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine an average 95% of radioactivity was \nrecovered in the urine and 4% in the faeces after nine days. The major urinary metabolites are the two \nisomeric N-glucuronides, which together accounted for approximately 34% of the dose and N-methyl\n3-hydroxymethyl dexmedetomidine O-glucuronide that accounted for 14.51% of the dose. The minor \nmetabolites dexmedetomidine carboxylic acid, 3-hydroxymethyl dexmedetomidine and its O-\nglucuronide individually comprised 1.11 to 7.66% of the dose. Less than 1% of unchanged parent drug \nwas recovered in the urine. Approximately 28% of the urinary metabolites are unidentified minor\nmetabolites. \n\nSpecial Populations\n\nNo major pharmacokinetic differences have been observed based on gender or age.\n\n\n\n12\n\nDexmedetomidine plasma protein binding is decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared \nwith healthy subjects. The mean percentage of unbound dexmedetomidine in plasma ranged from \n8.5% in healthy subjects to 17.9% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Subjects with varying \ndegrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C) had decreased hepatic clearance of \ndexmedetomidine and prolonged plasma elimination t1/2. The mean plasma clearance values of \nunbound dexmedetomidine for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were \n59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. The mean t1/2 for \nthe subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment was prolonged to 3.9, 5.4, and \n7.4 hours, respectively. Although dexmedetomidine is administered to effect, it may be necessary to \nconsider initial/maintenance dose reduction in patients with hepatic impairment depending on the \ndegree of impairment and the response.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance <30 ml/min) is not altered relative to healthy subjects. \n\nData in new-born infants (28 - 44 weeks gestation) to children 17 years of age are limited. \nDexmedetomidine half life in children (1 months to 17 years) appears similar to that seen in adults, but \nin new-born infants (under 1 month) it appears higher. In the age groups 1 months to 6 years, body \nweight-adjusted plasma clearance appeared higher but decreased in older children. Body weight-\nadjusted plasma clearance in new-born infants (under 1 month) appeared lower (0.9 l/h/kg) than in the \nolder groups due to immaturity. The available data is summarised in the following table;\n\nMean (95% CI)\n\nAge N Cl (l/h/kg) t1/2 (h)\n\nUnder 1 month 28\n0.93\n\n(0.76, 1.14)\n\n4.47\n\n(3.81, 5.25)\n\n1 to < 6 months 14\n1.21\n\n(0.99, 1.48)\n\n2.05\n\n(1.59, 2.65)\n\n6 to < 12 months 15\n1.11\n\n(0.94, 1.31)\n\n2.01\n\n(1.81, 2.22)\n\n12 to < 24 months 13\n1.06\n\n(0.87, 1.29)\n\n1.97\n\n(1.62, 2.39)\n\n2 to < 6 years 26\n1.11\n\n(1.00, 1.23)\n\n1.75\n\n(1.57, 1.96)\n\n6 to < 17 years 28\n0.80\n\n(0.69, 0.92)\n\n2.03\n\n(1.78, 2.31)\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\nIn the reproductive toxicity studies, dexmedetomidine had no effect on male or female fertility in the \nrat, and no teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. In the rabbit study intravenous \nadministration of the maximum dose, 96 µg/kg/day, produced exposures that are similar to those \nobserved clinically. In the rat, subcutaneous administration at the maximum dose, 200 µg/kg/day, \ncaused an increase in embryofetal death and reduced the fetal body weight. These effects were \nassociated with clear maternal toxicity. Reduced fetal body weight was noted also in the rat fertility \nstudy at dose 18 µg/kg/day and was accompanied with delayed ossification at dose 54 µg/kg/day. The \nobserved exposure levels in the rat are below the clinical exposure range. \n\n6.
