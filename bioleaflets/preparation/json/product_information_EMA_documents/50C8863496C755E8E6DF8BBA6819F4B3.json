NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSlenyto 1 mg prolonged-release tablets \nSlenyto 5 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nSlenyto 1 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 1 mg melatonin. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains lactose monohydrate equivalent to 8.32 mg lactose. \n \nSlenyto 5 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains 5 mg melatonin. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach prolonged-release tablet contains lactose monohydrate equivalent to 8.86 mg lactose. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nProlonged- release tablet.  \n \nSlenyto 1 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \nPink, film coated, round, biconvex, 3 mm diameter tablets with no imprint. \n \nSlenyto 5 mg prolonged-release tablets \n \nYellow, film coated, round, biconvex, 3 mm diameter tablets with no imprint. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSlenyto is indicated for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents aged 2-18 with Autism \nSpectrum Disorder (ASD) and / or Smith-Magenis syndrome, where sleep hygiene measures have \nbeen insufficient. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 2 mg of Slenyto. If an inadequate response has been observed, the \ndose should be increased to 5 mg, with a maximal dose of 10 mg. \n \nSlenyto should be taken once daily, 0.5-1 hour before bedtime and with or after food.   \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nData are available for up to 2 years’ treatment. The patient should be monitored at regular intervals (at \nleast every 6 months) to check that Slenyto is still the most appropriate treatment. After at least \n3 months of treatment, the physician should evaluate the treatment effect and consider stopping \ntreatment if no clinically relevant treatment effect is seen. If a lower treatment effect is seen after \ntitration to a higher dose, the prescriber should first consider a down-titration to a lower dose before \ndeciding on a complete discontinuation of treatment.  \n \nIf a tablet is forgotten, it could be taken before the patient goes to sleep that night, but after this time, \nno other tablet should be given before the next scheduled dose.   \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nThe effect of any stage of renal impairment on melatonin pharmacokinetics has not been studied. \nCaution should be used when melatonin is administered to patients with renal impairment. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere is no experience of the use of melatonin in patients with liver impairment. Therefore, melatonin \nis not recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population (under 2 years of age) \nThere is no relevant use of melatonin in children aged 0 to 2 years for the treatment of insomnia. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOral use. Tablets should be swallowed whole.  The tablet should not be broken, crushed or chewed \nbecause it will lose the prolonged release properties.  \n \nTablets can be put into food such as yoghurt, orange juice or ice-cream to facilitate swallowing and \nimprove compliance. If the tablets are mixed with food or drink, they should be taken immediately and \nthe mixture not stored. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nDrowsiness \n \nMelatonin may cause drowsiness.  Therefore the medicinal product should be used with caution if the \neffects of drowsiness are likely to be associated with a risk to safety (see section 4.7). \n \nAutoimmune diseases \n \nNo clinical data exist concerning the use of melatonin in individuals with autoimmune diseases.  \nTherefore, melatonin is not recommended for use in patients with autoimmune diseases.  \n \nInteractions with other medicines \n \nConcomitant use with fluvoxamine, alcohol, benzodiazepines/non-benzodiazepines hypnotics, \nthioridazine and imipramine is not recommended (see section 4.5).  \n \nLactose \n \nSlenyto contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase \ndeficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. In the absence of specific studies in children, \nthe drug interactions with melatonin are those known in adults. \n \nMelatonin’s metabolism is mainly mediated by CYP1A enzymes.  Therefore, interactions between \nmelatonin and other active substances as a consequence of their effect on CYP1A enzymes is possible. \n \nConcomitant use not recommended \n \nConcomitant use of the following medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.4): \n \nFluvoxamine \nFluvoxamine increases melatonin levels (by 17-fold higher AUC and a 12-fold higher serum Cmax) by \ninhibiting its metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.  The \ncombination should be avoided. \n \nAlcohol \nAlcohol should not be taken with melatonin, because it reduces the effectiveness of melatonin on \nsleep. \n \nBenzodiazepines/non-benzodiazepine hypnotics \nMelatonin may enhance the sedative properties of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, \nsuch as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone.  In a clinical trial, there was clear evidence for a transitory \npharmacodynamic interaction between melatonin and zolpidem one hour following co-dosing.  \nConcomitant administration resulted in increased impairment of attention, memory and co-ordination \ncompared to zolpidem alone. Combination with benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics \nshould be avoided. \n \nThioridazine and imipramine \nMelatonin has been co-administered in studies with thioridazine and imipramine, active substances \nwhich affect the central nervous system.  No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were \nfound in each case.  However, melatonin co-administration resulted in increased feelings of tranquility \nand difficulty in performing tasks compared to imipramine alone, and increased feelings of “muzzy-\nheadedness” compared to thioridazine alone.  Combination with thioridazine and imipramine should \nbe avoided. \n \nConcomitant use to be considered with caution \n \nConcomitant use of the following medicinal products should be considered with caution: \n \n5- or 8-methoxypsoralen \nCaution should be exercised in patients on 5- or 8-methoxypsoralen (5 or 8-MOP), which increases \nmelatonin levels by inhibiting its metabolism. \n \nCimetidine \nCaution should be exercised in patients on cimetidine which is a potent inhibitor of certain cytochrome \nP450 (CYP450) enzymes, mainly CYP1A2 and thereby increases plasma melatonin levels, by \ninhibiting its metabolism. \n \nOestrogens \nCaution should be exercised in patients on oestrogens (e.g. contraceptive or hormone replacement \ntherapy), which increase melatonin levels by inhibiting its metabolism by CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCYP1A2 inhibitors \nCYP1A2 inhibitors such as quinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) may give rise to increased \nmelatonin exposure. \n \nCYP1A2 inducers \nCYP1A2 inducers such as carbamazepine and rifampicin may reduce plasma concentrations of \nmelatonin. Therefore, when CYP1A2 inducers and melatonin are both given, dose adjustment may be \nrequired.   \n \nSmoking \n \nSmoking is known to induce CYP1A2 metabolism, therefore if patients stop or start smoking during \ntreatment with melatonin, dose adjustment may be required. \n \nNSAIDs \n \nProstaglandin synthesis inhibitors (NSAIDs) such as acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen, given in the \nevening may suppress endogenous melatonin levels in the early part of the night by up to 75%. If \npossible, administration of NSAIDs should be avoided in the evening. \n \nBeta-blockers \n \nBeta-blockers may supress the night-time release of endogenous melatonin and thus should be \nadministered in the morning. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no data from the use of melatonin in pregnant women.  Animal studies do not indicate \nreproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of \nmelatonin during pregnancy. \n \nBreastfeeding \n \nEndogenous melatonin was measured in human breast milk thus exogenous melatonin is probably \nsecreted into human milk.  Data in animals indicate maternal transfer of melatonin to the foetus via the \nplacenta or in the milk.  The effect of melatonin on newborns/infants is unknown. \n \nA decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from \nmelatonin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of \ntherapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nIn studies performed in both adult and juvenile animals, melatonin had no effect on male or female \nfertility (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMelatonin has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nMelatonin may cause drowsiness, therefore melatonin should be used with caution if the effects of \ndrowsiness are likely to be associated with a risk to safety.  \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with Slenyto in clinical studies were somnolence, \nfatigue, mood swings, headache, irritability, aggression and hangover occurring in 1:100-1:10 \nchildren.  \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. \nFrequency categories are defined using the following convention: Very common (≥1/10); Common \n(≥1/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare \n(<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nSystem Organ Class Common \nPsychiatric disorders Mood swings, Aggression, Irritability \nNervous system disorders Somnolence, Headache, Sudden onset of sleep  \nRespiratory, thoracic and \nmediastinal disorders \n\nSinusitis \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions \n\nFatigue, Hangover \n\n \nThe following adverse reactions (frequency unknown) have been reported with off-label use of the \nadult formulation, 2 mg prolonged-release melatonin tablets: epilepsy, visual impairment, dyspnoea, \nepistaxis, constipation, decreased appetite, swelling face, skin lesion, feeling abnormal, abnormal \nbehaviour and neutropenia. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs, drowsiness is to be expected.  Clearance of the active substance is expected within \n12 hours after ingestion.  No special treatment is required. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  Psycholeptics, melatonin receptor agonists, ATC code: N05CH01 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe activity of melatonin at the melatonin receptors (MT1, MT2 and MT3) is believed to contribute to \nits sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors (mainly MT1 and MT2) are involved in the \nregulation of circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nClinical efficacy and safety in the paediatric population \n \nEfficacy and safety have been assessed in a randomised, placebo-controlled study in children \ndiagnosed with ASDs and neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by Smith-Magenis syndrome who \nhad not shown improvement after standard sleep behavioural intervention. Treatment was \nadministered for up to two years.  \n \nThe study comprises 5 periods: 1) pre-study period (4 weeks), 2) baseline single-blind placebo period \n(2 weeks), 3) randomized placebo-controlled treatment period (13 weeks), 4) open label treatment \nperiod (91 weeks), and 5) single blind run-out period (2 weeks placebo).  \n \nA total of 125 children (2-17.0 years of age, mean age 8.7 +/- 4.15; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis \nsyndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioural intervention alone were randomized \nand 112 weeks’ results are available. 28.8% patients were diagnosed with ADHD before study \ninitiation and 77% had abnormal SDQ hyperactivity/inattention score (>=7) at baseline. \n \nRandomized placebo-controlled treatment period results (13 weeks) \nThe study met the primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant effects of Slenyto 2/5 mg \nversus placebo on change from baseline in mean Sleep and Nap Diary (SND)-assessed Total Sleep \nTime (TST) after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment. At baseline, mean TST was 457.2 minutes in \nthe Slenyto and 459.9 minutes in the placebo group. After 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, \nparticipants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with Slenyto compared to 9.1 minutes with \nplacebo adjusted mean treatment difference Slenyto–placebo 33.1 minutes in the all Randomized Set; \nMultiple Imputation (MI) (p=0 .026).  \n \nAt baseline, mean Sleep Latency (SL) was 95.2 minutes in the Slenyto and 98.8 minutes in the placebo \ngroup. By the end of the 13-week treatment period, children fell asleep on average 39.6 minutes faster \nwith Slenyto and 12.5 minutes faster with placebo adjusted mean treatment difference -25.3 minutes in \nthe all Randomized Set; MI( p=0.012) without causing earlier wakeup time. The rate of participants \nattaining clinically meaningful responses in TST (increase of 45 minutes from baseline) and/or SL \n(decrease of 15 minutes from baseline) was significantly higher with Slenyto than with placebo \n(68.9% versus 39.3% respectively; p=0 .001). \n \nBesides shortening of SL, increase in the longest sleep episode (LSE) = uninterrupted sleep duration \ncompared to placebo was observed. By the end of the 13-week double-blind period, the mean LSE \nincreased on average by 77.9 minutes in the Slenyto treated group, compared to 25.5 minutes in the \nplacebo-treated group. The adjusted estimated treatment differences were 43.2 minutes in the all \nRandomized Set (MI, p=0 .039). Wake up time was unaffected; after 13 weeks, patients’ wake up time \nwas delayed insignificantly by 0.09 hour (0.215) (5.4 minutes) with Slenyto compared to placebo \ntreatment. \n \nSlenyto 2 mg/5 mg treatment resulted in a significant improvement over placebo in the child’s \nexternalizing behaviours (hyperactivity/inattention+ conduct scores) as assessed by the Strength and \nDifficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment (p=0.021). For the total \nSDQ score after 13 weeks of double blind treatment, there was a trend to benefit in favour of Slenyto \n(p=0.077). For social functioning (CGAS), the differences between Slenyto and placebo were small \nand not statistically significant (Table 1). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1: CHILD BEHAVIOUR (13 weeks Double-blind) \nVariable Group Adjusted treatment means \n\n(SE) [95% CI] \nTreatment \ndifference \n(SE) \n\n95% CI p-value* \n\nSDQ \nExternalizing \nbehaviours \n\nSlenyto -0.70 (0.244)[-1.19;-0.22] \n-0.83 (0.355) -1.54,-0.13 0.021 Placebo 0.13(0.258)[-0.38; 0.64] \n\n     \nTotal score Slenyto -0.84 (0.387) [-1.61, -0.07] \n\n-1.01 (0.563)  -2.12, 0.11  0.077 Placebo 0.17 (0.409) [-0.64, 0.98] \n      \n\nCGAS \n Slenyto \n\nPlacebo \n \n\n1.96(1.328)(-0.67,4.60) \n1.84(1.355)(-0.84,4.52) \n \n\n0.13(1.901) -3.64,3.89 ns \n\n*MMRM analysis CI = confidence interval; SDQ = Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; CGAS = the \nChildren’s Global Assessment Scale; SE = standard error \n \nThe treatment effects on sleep variables were associated with improved parents’ well-being.

The improvements in total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL) and \nduration of uninterrupted sleep (LSE; longest sleep episode) seen in the double blind-phase were \nmaintained throughout the 39 weeks’ follow up period.  \n \nAfter 2 weeks withdrawal on placebo, a descriptive reduction in most scores was seen but levels were \nstill significantly better than baseline levels with no signs of rebound effects.  \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nIn the paediatric population comprising 16 ASD children ages 7-15 years old suffering from insomnia, \nfollowing Slenyto 2 mg (2 x 1 mg mini-tablets) administration after a standardized breakfast, \n\n\n\n9 \n\nmelatonin concentrations peaked within 2 hours after administration and remained elevated for 6 hours \nthereafter with a Cmax (SD) of 410 pg/ml (210) in the saliva. \n \nIn adults, following Slenyto 5 mg (1 x 5 mg mini-tablet) administered after food, melatonin \nconcentrations peaked within 3 hours after administration; Cmax (SD) was 3.57 ng/ml (3.64) in plasma. \nUnder fasted conditions Cmax was lower (1.73 ng/ml) and tmax was earlier (within 2 hours) with a minor \neffect on AUC-∞ that was slightly reduced (-14%) as compared to fed state. \n \nThe absorption of orally ingested melatonin is complete in adults and may be decreased by up to 50% \nin the elderly.  The kinetics of melatonin are linear over the range of 2-8 mg. \n \nData with 2 mg prolonged release melatonin tablets and data with 1 mg and 5 mg mini-tablets indicate \nthat there is no accumulation of melatonin after repeated dosing.  This finding is compatible with the \nshort half-life of melatonin in humans. \n \nBioavailability is in the order of 15%.  There is a significant first pass effect with an estimated first \npass metabolism of 85%. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe in vitro plasma protein binding of melatonin is approximately 60%.  Melatonin is mainly bound to \nalbumin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein and high density lipoprotein. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMelatonin undergoes a fast first hepatic pass metabolism and is metabolised predominantly by CYP1A \nenzymes, and possibly CYP2C19 of the cytochrome P450 system with elimination half life of ca 40 \nminutes. Prepubertal children and young adults metabolize melatonin faster than adults. Altogether, \nmelatonin metabolism declines with age, with pre-pubertal and pubertal metabolism faster than at \nolder age. The principal metabolite is 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (6-S-MT), which is inactive.  The site of \nbiotransformation is the liver.  The excretion of the metabolite is completed within 12 hours after \ningestion. \n \nMelatonin does not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A enzymes in vitro at supra-therapeutic concentrations. \n \nElimination \n \nTerminal half life (t½) is 3.5-4 hours.  Two liver-mediated metabolic pathways account for around 90% \nof melatonin metabolism. The predominant metabolic flux is through hydroxylation at C6 via the \nhepatic microsome P-450 system to yield 6-hydroxymelatonin. The second, less significant, pathway \nis 5-demethylation to yield a physiological melatonin precursor, N-acetylserotonin. Both 6-\nhydroxymelatonin and N-acetylserotonin are ultimately conjugated to sulfate and glucoronic acid, and \nexcreted in the urine as their corresponding 6-sulfatoxy and 6-glucoronide derivatives. \n \nElimination is by renal excretion of metabolites, 89% as sulfated and glucoronide conjugates of \n6-hydroxymelatonin (over 80% as 6-sulfatoxy melatonin) and 2% is excreted as melatonin (unchanged \nactive substance). \n \nGender \n \nA 3-4-fold increase in Cmax is apparent for women compared to men.  A five-fold variability in Cmax \nbetween different members of the same sex has also been observed.  However, no pharmacodynamic \ndifferences between males and females were found despite differences in blood levels. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nThere is no experience of the use of melatonin in paediatric patients with renal impairment (see \nSection 4.2).  However as melatonin is mainly eliminated via liver metabolism, and the metabolite 6-\nSMT is inactive, renal impairment is not expected to influence clearance of melatonin. \n \nHepatic impairment \nThe liver is the primary site of melatonin metabolism and therefore, hepatic impairment results in \nhigher endogenous melatonin levels. \n \nPlasma melatonin levels in patients with cirrhosis were significantly increased during daylight hours.  \nPatients had a significantly decreased total excretion of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin compared with controls. \n \nThere is no experience of the use of melatonin in paediatric patients with liver impairment. Published \ndata demonstrate markedly elevated endogenous melatonin levels during daytime hours due to \ndecreased clearance in patients with hepatic impairment (see Section 4.2). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \nand development. \n \nA slight effect on post-natal growth and viability was found in rats only at very high doses, equivalent \nto approximately 2000 mg/day in humans. \n \n \n6.

What Slenyto is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Slenyto is \nSlenyto is a medicine that contains the active ingredient, melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone produced \nnaturally by the body. \n \nWhat it is used for \nSlenyto is for use in children and adolescents (2 to 18 years old) with autism spectrum disorder \n(ASD) and/or Smith-Magenis syndrome, a neurogenetic disease (inherited condition affecting the \nnerves and brain). \n \nSlenyto shortens the time it takes to fall asleep and lengthens the duration of sleep. \nIt is for the treatment of insomnia (sleeplessness) when a healthy sleeping routine (such as a regular \nbedtime and soothing sleeping environment) has not worked well enough.  The medicine can help you \nor your child fall asleep and may help you or your child sleep for longer during the night. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you or your child takes Slenyto \n \nDO NOT take Slenyto if you or your child: \n- is allergic to melatonin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Slenyto if you or your child: \n \n- has liver or kidney problems. You should speak to your doctor before taking/giving Slenyto as \n\nits use is not recommended in such cases. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n- suffers from an autoimmune disease (where the body’s own immune (defence) system attacks \nparts of the body). You should speak to your doctor before taking/giving Slenyto as its use is \nnot recommended in such cases. \n\n- feels drowsy (see section below on “Driving and using machines”). \n \nChildren under 2 years old  \nDo not give this medicine to children below the age of 2 years as it has not been tested and its effects \nare unknown. \n \nOther medicines and Slenyto \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.   \n \nIn particular, taking Slenyto with the following medicines can increase the risk of side effects, or it can \naffect the way that Slenyto or the other medicine works: \n \n• fluvoxamine (used for the treatment of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) \n• methoxypsoralens (used in the treatment of skin disorders e.g. psoriasis) \n• cimetidine (used in the treatment of stomach problems such as ulcers) \n• quinolones (for example ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin) and rifampicin (used in the treatment \n\nof bacterial infections) \n• oestrogens (used in contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy)  \n• carbamazepine (used in the treatment of epilepsy) \n• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin and ibuprofen (used for treating \n\npain and inflammation). These medicines should be avoided, especially in the evening. \n• beta-blockers (used to control blood pressure). These medicines should be taken in the \n\nmorning. \n• benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone \n\n(used to induce sleep) \n• thioridazine (used for the treatment of schizophrenia) \n• imipramine (used for the treatment of depression) \n \nSmoking \nSmoking can increase the breakdown of melatonin by the liver, which may make this medicine less \neffective. Please tell your doctor if you or your child starts or stops smoking during treatment. \n \nSlenyto with alcohol \nDo not drink alcohol before, during or after taking Slenyto, because alcohol weakens the effect of the \nmedicine. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist before using Slenyto if you or your daughter: \n• is pregnant or might be pregnant.  As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use \n\nof melatonin during pregnancy. \n• is breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed. It is possible that melatonin is passed into human \n\nbreast milk, therefore your doctor will decide whether you or your daughter should breastfeed \nwhilst taking melatonin. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \nSlenyto may cause drowsiness.  After taking this medicine, you or your child should not drive a \nvehicle, ride a bicycle, or use machinery until completely recovered. \n \n\n\n\n26 \n\nIf you or your child suffers from continued drowsiness, you should consult your doctor. \n \nSlenyto contains lactose  \nSlenyto contains lactose monohydrate.  If you or your child has been told by your doctor that you have \nan intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.  \n \n \n3. How to take Slenyto \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are not sure. \n \nHow much \nSlenyto is available in two strengths: 1 mg and 5 mg.  The recommended starting dose is 2 mg (two \n1-mg tablets) once daily. If there is no improvement in your/your child’s symptoms, your doctor may \nincrease the dose of Slenyto to find the most suitable dose for you/your child. The maximum daily \ndose that you/your child will receive is 10 mg (two 5-mg tablets). \n \nWhen  \nSlenyto should be taken in the evening, 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. The tablets should be taken \nafter the evening meal, i.e. on a full stomach. \n \nHow to take Slenyto \nSlenyto is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and NOT broken, crushed or \nchewed.  Crushing and chewing damages the special properties of the tablet and means that they will \nnot work properly. \n \nThe whole tablets can be put into food like yoghurt, orange juice or ice-cream to help with \nswallowing. If the tablets are mixed with these foods, they should be given immediately and not left or \nstored, as this may affect the way the tablets work.  If the tablets are mixed with any other type of \nfood, the tablets may not work properly. \n \nHow long \nSlenyto is for use in the treatment of insomnia.  You or your child should be monitored by your doctor \nat regular intervals (recommended every 6 months) to check that Slenyto is still the right treatment for \nyou/them.   \n \nIf you or your child takes more Slenyto than you/they should \nIf you/your child has accidentally taken too much medicine, contact the doctor or pharmacist as soon \nas possible. \n \nTaking more than the recommended daily dose may make you/your child feel drowsy. \n \nIf you or your child forgets to take Slenyto \nIf you or your child forgets to take a tablet, it could be taken before going to sleep that night, but after \nthis time, no other tablet should be taken before the next evening. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you or your child stops taking Slenyto \nYou should talk to your doctor before you/your child stops taking Slenyto. It is important to continue \ntaking this medicine to treat the condition. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n4.
