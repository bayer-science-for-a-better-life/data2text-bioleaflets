NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nLysaKare 25 g/25 g solution for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne 1,000 mL bag contains 25 g of L-arginine hydrochloride and 25 g of L-lysine hydrochloride. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for infusion (infusion). \nClear, colourless solution, free from visible particles \npH: 5.1 – 6.1 \nOsmolarity: 420 – 480 mOsm/L \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nLysaKare is indicated for reduction of renal radiation exposure during peptide-receptor radionuclide \ntherapy (PRRT) with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide in adults. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nLysaKare is indicated for administration with PRRT with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide therefore, it \nshould only be administered by a health care provider experienced in the use of PRRT. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults \n \nThe recommended treatment regimen in adults consists of infusion of full bag of LysaKare \nconcomitantly with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide infusion, even when patients require PRRT dose \nreduction.  \n \nPre-treatment with an anti-emetic 30 minutes prior to start of LysaKare infusion is recommended to \nreduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \n \nDue to the potential for clinical complications related to volume overload and an increase of potassium \nin blood associated with the use of LysaKare, this product should not be administered in patients with \ncreatinine clearance <30 mL/min.  \nCare should be taken with LysaKare use in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 \nmL/min. Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is not recommended for patients with renal \nfunction between 30 and 50 mL/min therefore, the benefit risk for these patients will always need to be \nweighed carefully, which should include consideration of an increased risk for transient hyperkalaemia \nin these patients (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n\n2 \n\n\n\n \nThe safety and efficacy of LysaKare in children less than 18 years have not been established.  \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nFor intravenous use.  \nLysaKare should be administered as a 4-hour infusion (250 mL/hour) starting 30 minutes prior to \nadministration of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide to achieve optimal renal protection. \nLysaKare and lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide must be given through a separate infusion line. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n• Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n• Pre-existing clinically significant hyperkalaemia if not adequately corrected before starting the \n\nLysaKare infusion (see section 4.4). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHyperkalaemia \n \nAn increase of serum potassium levels may occur in patients receiving arginine and lysine. Serum \npotassium level increases are generally mild and transient. According to limited available data \nmaximum levels should be reached approximatively by 4 to 5 hours after start of the infusion and \nshould return to normal levels by 24 hours.  \nSerum potassium levels must be tested before each treatment with LysaKare. In case of \nhyperkalaemia, patient’s history of hyperkalaemia and concomitant medication should be checked. \nHyperkalaemia must be corrected accordingly before starting the infusion (see section 4.3).  \nIn case of pre-existing clinically significant hyperkalaemia, a second monitoring prior to LysaKare \ninfusion must confirm that hyperkalaemia has been successfully corrected. The patient should be \nmonitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalaemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, \nchest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). An ECG \nshould be performed prior to discharging the patient.  \nVital signs should be monitored during the infusion regardless of baseline serum potassium levels. \nPatients should be instructed to drink substantial quantities of water (at least 1 glass every hour) on the \nday of infusion to remain hydrated and facilitate excretion of excess serum potassium.  \nIn case hyperkalaemia symptoms develop during LysaKare infusion, appropriate corrective measures \nmust be taken. In case of severe symptomatic hyperkalaemia, discontinuation of LysaKare infusion \nshould be considered, taking into consideration the risk-benefit of renal protection versus acute \nhyperkalaemia. \n \nPatients with renal impairment \n \nThe use of arginine and lysine has not been specifically studied in patients with renal impairment. \nArginine and lysine are substantially excreted and reabsorbed by the kidney, and their efficacy in the \nreduction of renal radiation exposure is dependent on this. Due to the potential for clinical \ncomplications related to volume overload and an increase of potassium in blood associated with the \nuse of LysaKare, this product should not be administered in patients with creatinine clearance \n<30 mL/min. Kidney function (creatinine and creatinine clearance) should be tested before each \nadministration. \nCare should be taken with LysaKare use in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and \n50 mL/min. Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is not recommended for patients with renal \nfunction between 30 and 50 mL/min therefore, the benefit risk for these patients will always need to be \nweighed carefully, which should include consideration of an increased risk for transient hyperkalemia \nin these patients. \n \nPatiens with hepatic impairment \n\n3 \n\n\n\n \nThe use of arginine and lysine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Liver \nfunction (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT], aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT], albumin, bilirubin) \nshould be tested before each administration. \nCare should be taken with LysaKare use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and in case of \neither total bilirubinemia >3 times the upper limit of normal or albuminemia <30 g/L and prothrombin \nratio <70% during treatment. Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is not recommended in \nthese circumstances.  \n \nHeart failure  \n \nDue to potential for clinical complications related to volume overload care should be taken with use of \narginine and lysine in patients with severe heart failure defined as class III or class IV in the NYHA \nclassification.  \nTreatment with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is not recommended for patients with severe heart \nfailure defined as class III or class IV in the NYHA classification therefore, the benefit risk for these \npatients will always need to be weighed carefully. \n \nElderly  \n \nBecause elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in \ndetermining eligibility based on creatinine clearance.  \n \nMetabolic acidosis \n \nMetabolic acidosis has been observed with complex amino-acid solutions administered as part of total \nparenteral nutrition (TPN) protocols. Shifts in acid-base balance alter the balance of extracellular-\nintracellular potassium and the development of acidosis may be associated with rapid increases in \nplasma potassium. \n \nAs LysaKare is administered with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, please also refer to section 4.4 of the \nlutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide SmPC for further warnings specific to treatment with lutetium (177Lu) \noxodotreotide. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \nNo interaction with other medicinal product is expected since there is no information that other drugs \nare re-absorbed by the same kidney re-absorption mechanism. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nThere is no relevant use of this medicinal product in women of childbearing potential since lutetium \n(177Lu) oxodotreotide is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy \nhas not been excluded due to the risk associated with the ionizing radiation (see section 4.1). \n \nPregnancy  \n \nThere are no data on the use of arginine and lysine in pregnant women.  \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nArginine and lysine, being naturally occurring amino acids, are excreted in human milk, but effects on \nthe breastfed newborns/infants are unlikely. Breast-feeding should be avoided during treatment with \nlutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide. \n \n\n4 \n\n\n\nFertility \n \nThere are no data on the effects of arginine and lysine on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nLysaKare has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThere are very limited data on the safety profile of arginine and lysine solution for infusion without \nconcomitant administration of PRRT, which also includes the use of anti-emetics as pre-medication \nand often the concomitant use of short acting somatostatin analogues. \nThe main adverse reactions which are related mainly to the amino acid solution are nausea \n(approximately 25%), vomiting (approximately 10%) and hyperkalaemia. These adverse reactions are \nmostly mild to moderate. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions  \n \nThe adverse reactions listed below have been identified in publications of studies with amino acid \nsolutions with the same composition with regards to the amino acid content, involving over \n900 patients receiving more than 2,500 doses of arginine and lysine during PRRT with various \nradiolabelled somatostatin analogues.  \n  \nThe adverse reactions are listed according to the frequency. The frequencies are categorised as \nfollows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare \n(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \ndata). \n \nTable 1  Adverse drug reactions \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIn the event of over-hydration or solute overload, the elimination should be promoted by frequent \nmicturition or by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding. \n\nAdverse drug reaction Frequency category   \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders   \nHyperkalaemia Not known   \nNervous system disorders   \nDizziness Not known   \nHeadache Not known   \nVascular disorders    \nFlushing Not known   \nGastrointestinal disorders   \nNausea Very common   \nVomiting Very common   \nAbdominal pain  Not known   \n\n5 \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: All other therapeutic products, detoxifying agents for antineoplastic \ntreatment, ATC code: V03AF11 \n \nMechanism of action \n \nArginine and lysine undergo glomerular filtration and, via competition, interfere with renal resorption \nof lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide, reducing the radiation dose delivered to the kidney.  \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical efficacy and safety for arginine and lysine are based on published literature of studies using \nsolutions with the same arginine and lysine content as LysaKare.  \nThe toxicities that are observed following administration of PRRT are directly due to radiation-\nabsorbed dose to organs. The kidneys are the critical organs for toxicity for lutetium (177Lu) \noxodotreotide and dose limiting if amino acids are not administered to reduce renal uptake and \nretention.  \nA dosimetry study including 6 patients showed that a 2.5% Lysine-Arginine amino acid solution \nreduced renal radiation exposure by about 47% as compared to no treatment, without having an effect \non tumour uptake of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide. This reduction in renal radiation exposure \nmitigates the risk for radiation-induced renal injury.  \nBased on a publication of the largest study using arginine and lysine in the same quantities as \nLysaKare, the average kidney absorbed dose, as determined by planar imaging dosimetry, was \n20.1±4.9 Gy, which is below the established threshold for the occurrence of renal toxicities of 23 Gy. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nArginine and lysine are naturally occurring amino acids that follow physiological pharmacokinetic \nsteps and biochemical processes after infusion. \n \nAbsorption \n \nDue to the intravenous route of administration, LysaKare is 100% bioavailable. \n \nDistribution \n \nTransient elevations in plasma arginine and lysine are observed after intravenous administration, \nwhereupon the highly water soluble amino acids are quickly distributed throughout tissues and body \nfluid.  \n \nBiotransformation \n \nLike other naturally occurring amino acids, arginine and lysine serve as building blocks in protein \nanabolism and serve as precursors for several other products, including nitric oxide, urea, creatinine, \nand Acetyl-Coenzyme A. \n \nElimination \n \nArginine and lysine are rapidly distributed. Based on a study with 30 g arginine infused over \n30 minutes, plasma elimination of amino acids follows at least a biphasic or triphasic decline, with \nlevels returning to baseline within 6 hours post-dose. Initial rapid clearance is through glomerular \n\n6 \n\n\n\nfiltration in the kidney in the first 90 minutes post-infusion. Remaining amino acid is removed by non-\nrenal clearance. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \nNo pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of arginine and lysine at the same dose as LysaKare \nand for the same indication in paediatric patients.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThere were no non-clinical studies conducted with LysaKare. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n17 \n\n\n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nLysaKare 25 g/25 g solution for infusion \nL-arginine hydrochloride/L-lysine hydrochloride  \n\n \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What LysaKare is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you take LysaKare  \n3. How to take LysaKare  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store LysaKare \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What LysaKare is and what it is used for \n \nWhat LysaKare is  \nLysaKare contains the active substances arginine and lysine, two different amino acids. It belongs to a \ngroup of medicines which are used to reduce the side effects of anti-cancer medicine. \n \nWhat LysaKare is used for \nLysaKare is used in adult patients to protect kidneys from unnecessary radiation during treatment with \nLutathera (lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide), a radioactive medicine used to treat certain tumours. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take LysaKare \n \nFollow all of your doctor’s instructions carefully. As you will receive another treatment, Lutathera, \nwith LysaKare, read the Lutathera leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n \nYou should not be given LysaKare \n- if you are allergic to arginine and lysine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6). \n- If you have high blood levels of potassium (hyperkalaemia). \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking LysaKare if your kidneys, heart or liver are severely impaired or if \nyou have a history of high blood levels of potassium (hyperkalaemia). \nBecause feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting are commonly seen with amino acid infusions, you will be \ngiven medicines to prevent nausea and vomitting 30 minutes before the LysaKare infusion.  \n \nThe doctor will check your blood potassium levels, and will correct them if they are too high before \nstarting the infusion. The doctor will also check your kidney and liver function before starting the \ninfusion. For other tests which need to be performed before your treatment, please read the Lutathera \nleaflet. \nFollow your doctor’s advice on how much fluid to drink on the day of your treatment so you stay well \nhydrated. \n \n\n18 \n\n\n\nChildren and adolescents \nThis medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years old because it is not \nknown whether it is safe and effective in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and LysaKare \nTell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nIt is considered unlikely that LysaKare will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. \n \n \n3. How to take LysaKare \n \nThe recommended dose of LysaKare solution is 1 L (1,000 mL). You should receive the full LysaKare \ndose, regardless of any Lutathera dose adjustments. \nLysaKare is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion of LysaKare will start 30 minutes \nbefore you are given Lutathera, and will last over a 4 hour period.  \n \nIf you receive more LysaKare than you should  \nLysaKare will be given in a controlled clinical setting and is provided as a single dose bag. It is \ntherefore unlikely that you will receive more of the infusion than you should as your doctor will \nmonitor you during the treatment. However, in the case of an overdose, you will receive the \nappropriate treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.  \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):  \n• nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting  \n \nNot known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data):  \n• high potassium levels seen in blood tests, abdominal (belly) pain, headache, dizziness and \n\nflushing. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this \nleaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \nBy reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store LysaKare \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label after EXP.
