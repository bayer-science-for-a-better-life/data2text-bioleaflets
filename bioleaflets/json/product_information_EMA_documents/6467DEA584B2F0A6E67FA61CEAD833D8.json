This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVaxchora effervescent powder and powder for oral suspension \nCholera vaccine (recombinant, live, oral) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach dose of vaccine contains 4 × 108 to 2 × 109 viable cells of V. cholerae live, attenuated strain CVD \n103-HgR1. \n1 Produced by recombinant DNA technology. \n \nThis product contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). \n \nExcipient(s) with known effect: each dose of vaccine contains lactose, sucrose, and 863 milligrams of \nsodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nEffervescent powder and powder for oral suspension. \nWhite-to-off-white buffer powder and white-to-beige active ingredient powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVaxchora is indicated for active immunisation against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 \nin adults and children aged 6 years and older. \n \nThis vaccine should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and children aged 6 years and older \n \nA single oral dose should be administered at least 10 days prior to potential exposure to V. cholerae \nO1. \n \nRevaccination \n \nNo data are available on revaccination interval. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe safety and efficacy of Vaxchora in children less than 6 years has not been established. No data are \navailable. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Vaxchora prior to administration, see section 6.6. \n \nEating and drinking should be avoided for 60 minutes before and after oral ingestion of Vaxchora. \nThe reconstituted vaccine forms a slightly cloudy suspension that may contain some white particulates. \nAfter reconstitution, the suspension should be drunk within 15 minutes. The recipient should drink the \nfull contents of the cup at once. Some residue may remain in the cup. The cup should be washed with \nsoap and hot water. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nAllergic reaction to previous ingestion of Vaxchora. \n \nIndividuals with congenital immune deficiency or receiving immunosuppressive drugs or treatments. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administrated product should be clearly recorded. \n \nFactors affecting protection \n \nVaxchora confers protection specific to Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1. Immunisation does not protect \nagainst V. cholerae O139 or other species of Vibrio. \n \nVaxchora does not provide 100% protection. Vaccinees should adhere to hygiene advice and exercise \ncaution regarding food and water consumed in cholera-affected areas. \n \nNo data are available in persons living in cholera-affected areas or in individuals with pre-existing \nimmunity to cholera. \n \nThe protection afforded by Vaxchora may be reduced in HIV-infected individuals. \n \nPotential risk to contacts \n \nVaxchora shedding in the stools was studied for 7 days post-vaccination, and was observed in 11.3% \nof vaccine recipients. The duration of shedding of the vaccine strain is unknown. There is a potential \nfor transmission of the vaccine strain to non-vaccinated close contacts (e.g., household contacts). \n \nConcomitant administration with antibacterial agents and/or chloroquine \n \nConcomitant administration with antibacterial agents and/or chloroquine should be avoided because \nprotection against cholera may be diminished. Refer to section 4.5. \n \nGastrointestinal Disease \n \nIn individuals with acute gastroenteritis, vaccination should be postponed until after recovery, because \nprotection against cholera may be diminished. The degree of protection and the effects of vaccination \nin individuals with chronic gastrointestinal disease are unknown. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nLimitations of the clinical data \n \nClinical trials were conducted in individuals age 6 to 64 years old. Efficacy was demonstrated using \nhuman cholera challenge at 10 days or 3 months post-vaccination in adults age 18-45 years and \nimmunobridging to other populations based on seroconversion rate. Immunogenicity data are available \nfor 6 months post-vaccination. There are no immunogenicity or efficacy data in individuals over \n64 years of age. \n \nExcipients \n \nThe vaccine contains lactose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, congenital lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption, fructose intolerance, or \nsucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this vaccine. \n \nThe vaccine contains 863 mg of sodium per dose, equivalent to 43% of the WHO recommended \nmaximum daily intake of 2 g of sodium for an adult. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with, Vaxchora, however data and clinical experience \nfrom other vaccines can be applicable to Vaxchora. \n \nThere should be an interval of 2 hours between the administration of Vaxchora and of typhoid vaccine \nTy21a (gastro-resistant capsules) as the buffer administered with Vaxchora may affect the transit of \nthe capsules through the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nConcomitant administration of Vaxchora with systemic antibiotics active against V. cholerae should be \navoided since these agents may prevent a sufficient degree of multiplication to occur in order to induce \na protective immune response. Vaxchora should not be administered to patients who have received \noral or parenteral antibiotics within 14 days prior to vaccination. Oral or parenteral antibiotics should \nbe avoided for 10 days following vaccination with Vaxchora. \n \nData from the study of a previous CVD 103-HgR-based vaccine indicate that immune responses to \nVaxchora and protection against cholera may be diminished when Vaxchora is administered \nconcomitantly with chloroquine. Administer Vaxchora at least 10 days before beginning antimalarial \nprophylaxis with chloroquine. There are no data regarding concomitant use of Vaxchora with other \nanti-malarial drugs. \n \nThe vaccine is acid-labile and is administered with a buffer. Eating and drinking should be avoided for \n60 minutes before and after taking Vaxchora as this may interfere with the protective effect of the \nbuffer. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are limited data from the use of Vaxchora in pregnant women. \nAnimal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \nVaxchora should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the \npotential risks, including those to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Vaxchora is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed child cannot be \nexcluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from using \n\n\n\n5 \n\nVaxchora taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of Vaxchora for \nthe woman. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human or animal data on the effect of Vaxchora on fertility are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVaxchora has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of safety profile \n \nThe most frequent reported adverse reactions following Vaxchora administration are tiredness \n(30.2%), headache (28.3%), abdominal pain (18.4%), nausea/vomiting (17.7%), and lack of appetite \n(15.7%). \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \nThe adverse reaction frequency classification used is as follows: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥\n1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\nAdverse Reactions Frequency \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nDecreased appetite Very common \nNervous system disorders \nHeadache Very common \nDizziness Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders \nAbdominal pain, nausea/vomiting Very common \nDiarrhoea Common \nFlatulence, constipation, abdominal distension, dyspepsia, abnormal faeces, \ndry mouth, eructation \n\nUncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nRash Uncommon \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nArthralgia Uncommon \nChills Rare \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nFatigue Very common \nPyrexia Uncommon \n\n \nPaediatric population \nA clinical trial was conducted in 374 children age 6 to <18 years. Based on the results of this trial the \ntype of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar to those in adults. Some adverse \nreactions were more common in children than adults, including headache (36.0% vs 28.3%), fatigue \n(37.9% vs 30.2%), abdominal pain (32.6% vs 18.4%), vomiting (5.3% vs 0.2%), decreased appetite \n(22.4% vs 15.7%) and pyrexia (2.5% vs 0.8%). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere have been reports of multiple doses of Vaxchora being administered several weeks apart. The \nadverse reactions reported were comparable to those seen after the recommended dose. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Bacterial vaccines, ATC code: J07AE02 \n \nMechanism of action \nVaxchora contains live attenuated cholera bacteria (V. cholerae O1 classical Inaba strain CVD 103-\nHgR) that replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient and induce serum vibriocidal antibody \nand memory B cell responses. Immune mechanisms conferring protection against cholera following \nreceipt of Vaxchora have not been determined, however, rises in serum vibriocidal antibody 10 days \nafter vaccination with Vaxchora were associated with protection in a human challenge study. \n \nEfficacy against cholera challenge \nVaxchora efficacy against cholera was demonstrated in a human challenge study conducted in 197 \nhealthy adult volunteers mean age 31 years (range 18 to 45, 62.9% male, 37.1% female) in which a \nsubset of Vaxchora or placebo recipients were challenged with live V. cholerae at 10 days post-\nvaccination (n=68) or 3 months post-vaccination (n=66). Protective efficacy against moderate to \nsevere diarrhoea is shown in Table 1. \n \nIn individuals with blood group O only, the protective efficacy against moderate or severe diarrhoea \nwas 78.4% in the 10 day challenge group (n=19) and 82.5% in the 3 month challenge group (n=20). \n \nTable 1: Protective Efficacy in the Prevention of Moderate to Severe Diarrhoea Following \n\nChallenge with V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba at 10 Days and 3 Months Post-Vaccination \n(Intent-to-Treat Population) \n\n \n\nParameter \n\nVaxchora 10 Day \nChallenge \n\nN=35 \n\nVaxchora 3 Month \nChallenge \n\nN=33 \n\nCombined Placebo 10 \nDay or 3 Month \n\nChallenge \nN=66 \n\nNumber of Subjects with \nModerate or Severe \nDiarrhoea (Attack Rate) \n\n2 (5.7%) 4 (12.1%) 39 (59.1%) \n\nProtective Efficacy % \n[95% CI] \n\n90.3% \n[62.7%, 100.0%] \n\n79.5% \n[49.9%, 100.0%] \n\n- \n\n \nImmunogenicity \nThe human challenge study showed that vibriocidal seroconversion, defined as a four-fold or greater \nrise in serum vibriocidal antibody titres from baseline measured 10 days after vaccination, had a nearly \none-to-one correlation with protection against moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. Seroconversion was \ntherefore selected as the immunologic bridge between adults age 18 to <46 years in the challenge \nstudy and other populations, i.e. older adults and paediatric subjects. Three additional studies evaluated \nimmunogenicity: a large trial in 3146 healthy adults age 18 to<46 years (mean age 29.9, range 18-46, \n45.2% male, 54.8% female); a trial in 398 healthy older adults age 46 to <65 years (mean age 53.8, \nrange 46-64, 45.7% male, 54.3% female); and a paediatric trial in healthy subjects age 6-17 years. \nPrespecified immunobridging analyses, based on differences in seroconversion rates, were determined \nto demonstrate non-inferiority in seroconversion rate between older adults or paediatric subjects and \nthe adults age 18 to <46 in the large immunogenicity trial. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nThe seroconversion rates in vaccine and placebo recipients from each trial, as well as immunobridging \nresults, are summarised in Tables 2 and 4. Seroconversion rates in older adults and paediatric subjects \nwere non-inferior to those in younger adults. \n \nIn the three adult studies significant increases in the percentage of anti-O1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) \nIgA and IgG memory B cells and anti-cholera toxin IgG memory B cells were seen at 90 and 180 days \nafter vaccination. No relationship between age and memory B cell response was observed. Geometric \nmean titres (GMTs) of serum vibriocidal antibodies in vaccinated subjects were also significantly \nhigher than the respective GMTs of placebo recipients at 90 and 180 days after immunisation in all age \ngroups.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n21 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nVaxchora effervescent powder and powder for oral suspension \ncholera vaccine (recombinant, live, oral) \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you take this vaccine because it contains important \ninformation for you. \n– Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n– If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. \n– This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n– If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Vaxchora is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Vaxchora \n3. How to take Vaxchora \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vaxchora \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vaxchora is and what it is used for \n \nVaxchora is an oral vaccine against cholera that stimulates the immunological defence in the gut. The \nvaccine is used for protection from cholera in adults and children aged 6 years and older. The vaccine \nmust be taken at least 10 days before travelling to a cholera-affected area. \n \nHow Vaxchora works \n \nVaxchora prepares the immune system (the body’s defences) to defend itself against cholera. When a \nperson takes the vaccine, the immune system makes proteins called antibodies against the cholera \nbacterium and its toxin (harmful substance) that causes diarrhoea. In this way the immune system is \nready to fight cholera bacteria if the person comes into contact with it. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vaxchora \n \nDo not take Vaxchora: \n– if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6). \n– if you had allergic reactions when you previously took Vaxchora. \n– if you have a weakened immune system, for example, if you were born with a weakened \n\nimmune system or if you are having treatments such as high-dose corticosteroid treatment, \ncancer medicines or radiotherapy that can weaken the immune system. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Vaxchora. \n \nNot everyone taking Vaxchora will be fully protected against cholera. It is important to continue to \nfollow hygiene advice and take special care with food and water in cholera-affected areas. \n \nVaxchora may be less effective if you have HIV. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \nBacteria from the vaccine may be present in your stool for at least 7 days after you take the vaccine. \nTo prevent any contamination, wash your hands thoroughly after visiting the toilet and before \npreparing food for at least 14 days after you take Vaxchora. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this vaccine to children younger than 6 years of age because it is not known how well it \nworks in this age group. \n \nOther medicines and Vaxchora \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines or vaccines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal \nmedicines. This is because Vaxchora can affect the way some other medicines and vaccines work. \n \nIn particular tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking: \n• antibiotics – Vaxchora may not work if you take it while you are also taking antibiotics. Take \n\nVaxchora no earlier than 14 days after the last dose of an antibiotic. Avoid antibiotics for \n10 days after taking Vaxchora. \n\n• chloroquine for malaria prevention – Vaxchora may not work if you take it while you are also \ntaking chloroquine. Take Vaxchora at least 10 days before starting chloroquine or 14 days after \ntaking chloroquine. \n\n• the typhoid vaccine Ty21a – Vaxchora may not work if it is taken at the same time as Ty21a. \nYou should take Vaxchora at least 2 hours before or after taking Ty21a. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Vaxchora. \n \nVaxchora with food and drink \nYou must not eat or drink for 60 minutes before and after taking Vaxchora as this may reduce the \nvaccine’s effectiveness. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nVaxchora is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any \nmachines if you are feeling unwell. \n \nVaxchora contains lactose, sucrose, and sodium \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicinal product. \n \nThis vaccine contains 863 mg of sodium (the main component of cooking/table salt) per dose. This is \nequivalent to 43% of the recommended daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. Please take this \ninto account if you are on a controlled sodium diet. \n \n \n3. How to take Vaxchora \n \nAlways take this vaccine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is the contents of both sachets in the carton. \n \nProtection against cholera is established within 10 days after taking Vaxchora. Your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse will tell you how soon before travelling to take the vaccine. \n \n\n\n\n23 \n\nInstructions: \n \n\nPREPARE THIS VACCINE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN THIS LEAFLET \n \nPlease read the following before you begin: \nVaxchora may not work if the following occurs: \n• Incorrect storage; the vaccine must be stored in the refrigerator. \n• Using the incorrect amount of water; 100 mL must be used. \n• Using the incorrect type of water; bottled water that is cold or room temperature and non-\n\ncarbonated must be used. \n• Mixing the sachets in the wrong order; sachet 1 must be added to the water first. If the sachets \n\nare mixed in the wrong order you must discard the vaccine and request a replacement dose. \n• Eating or drinking; must be avoided 60 minutes before and after taking the vaccine, eating or \n\ndrinking can reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. \n \nDo not touch your eyes when you prepare the vaccine to avoid contamination. \n \nIf any powder or liquid gets spilt, clean the surface with hot water and soap or an antibacterial \ndisinfectant. \n \nIf there is a significant spill (more than a few drops of liquid or grains of powder), dispose of the \nvaccine and get a new one from your doctor or pharmacist; DO NOT take the remaining medication. \nStep 1  Gather materials: \n\n• Clean cup \n• Utensil to stir \n• Bottled water (non-carbonated, cold or \n\nroom temperature, 25°C or less) \n• Item to measure 100 mL of bottled water \n\n(e.g. measuring jug) \n• Scissors \n\nStep 2 \n\n \n\nRemove the vaccine from the refrigerator. \n \n\nStep 3 \n\n \n\nLocate the two sachets: the sachets are labelled \n1 and 2. \n \nSachet 1 contains “Sodium hydrogen \ncarbonate effervescent powder” (buffer) and is \nblack and white. Sachet 2 contains “Vaxchora® \nActive ingredient” and is blue and white. \n \nIf a sachet is not intact, do not use either \nsachet and contact your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse about acquiring a replacement dose; \nusing a sachet that is not intact can reduce the \neffectiveness of the vaccine. \n\n\n\n24 \n\nStep 4 \n\n \n\nMeasure 100 mL of bottled cold or room \ntemperature non-carbonated drinking water \nand pour into a clean cup. \n \nUsing bottled water is necessary for the \nvaccine to be effective – using non-bottled \n(e.g. tap water) may render the vaccine \nineffective. \n\nStep 5 \n\n \n\nUse scissors to cut off the top of sachet 1. \n \nDo not put your fingers into the sachet. Wash \nyour hands if you touch the sachet contents, in \norder to reduce the chance of contamination. \n\nStep 6 \n\n \n\nEmpty the contents of sachet 1 into the water \nin the cup. It will fizz. \n\nStep 7 \n\n \n\nStir until the powder completely dissolves. \n\nStep 8 \n\n \n\nUse scissors to cut off the top of sachet 2. \n \nDo not put your fingers into the sachet. Wash \nyour hands if you touch the sachet contents, in \norder to reduce the chance of contamination. \n\nStep 9 \n\n \n\nEmpty the contents of sachet 2 into the cup. \n\n\n\n25 \n\nStep 10 \n\n \n\nStir for at least 30 seconds. The powder from \nsachet 2 may not dissolve completely. It will \nform a slightly cloudy mixture with some \nwhite particles. \n\nStep 11 \n\n \n\nIf you have spilled any material, DO NOT take \nthe remaining dose and contact your doctor, \npharmacist, or nurse about acquiring a \nreplacement dose. \n \nDrink the full contents of the cup within \n15 minutes of preparing it.
