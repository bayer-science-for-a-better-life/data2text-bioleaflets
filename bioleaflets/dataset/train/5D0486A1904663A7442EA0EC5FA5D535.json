NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nAdjupanrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nPandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nAfter mixing, 1 dose (0.5 ml) contains: \n \nSplit influenza virus, inactivated, containing antigen* equivalent to: \n \nA/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain used (NIBRG-14) 3.75 micrograms** \n \n* propagated in eggs \n** haemagglutinin  \n \nThis vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic. \n \nAS03 adjuvant composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-\u03b1-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and \npolysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams) \n \nThe suspension and emulsion vials once mixed form a multidose container.  See section 6.5 for the \nnumber of doses per vial. \n  \nExcipient with known effect  \nThe vaccine contains 5 micrograms thiomersal (see section 4.4). \n \nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection. \nThe suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid. \nThe emulsion is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nProphylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.  \n \nAdjupanrix should be used in accordance with official guidance. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \nPersons not previously vaccinated with Prepandrix  \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years: \nOne dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \nA second dose of 0.5 ml should be given after an interval of at least three weeks and up to twelve \nmonths after the first dose for maximum efficacy.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nBased on very limited data, adults aged >80 years may require a double dose of Adjupanrix on an \nelected date and again after an interval of at least three weeks in order to achieve an immune response \n(see section 5.1). \n \nPersons previously vaccinated with one or two doses of Prepandrix containing HA derived from a \ndifferent clade of the same influenza subtype as the pandemic influenza virus: \n \nAdults from the age of 18 years onwards: one dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere are limited safety and immunogenicity data available on the administration of Adjupanrix and \non administration of half a dose of the vaccine (i.e. 1.875 \u00b5g HA and half the amount of AS03 \nadjuvant) at 0 and 21 days in children aged 3 to 9 years.   \n \nCurrently available data are described in section 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \n \nFor further information, see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nImmunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection. \n \nIf a double dose is given, the injections should be given into opposite limbs preferably into the deltoid \nmuscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass). \n \nFor instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHistory of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues \n(egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of \nthis vaccine. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided \nthat facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need. See section 4.4. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nCaution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other \nthan anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to \nthiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate \nand sodium deoxycholate). \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nIf the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile \nillness or acute infection. \n \nAdjupanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. There are no data with \nAdjupanrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits \nand potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding \ndisorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the \nrisk of bleedings. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nThere are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of \ninfluenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. \n \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. \n \nA protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to \nthe needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that \nprocedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n \nEpidemiological studies relating to another AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (Pandemrix H1N1, also \nmanufactured in the same facility as Adjupanrix), in several European countries have indicated an \nincreased risk of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated \nindividuals. In children/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional \n1.4 to 8 cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 \nyears have indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. These data \nsuggest that the excess risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination. There is currently no \nevidence to indicate that Adjupanrix may be associated with a risk of narcolepsy. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nClinical data in children less than 6 years of age who received two doses of pandemic preparedness or \nzoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1) indicate an increase in frequency of fever (axillary\u226538\u00b0C) after the \nadministration of the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the \nfever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young \nchildren (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) post-vaccination. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThere are no data on co-administration of Adjupanrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with \nanother vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be \nnoted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. \n \nThe immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant \ntreatment. \n \nFollowing influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA \nmethod for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, \nHTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results \nmay be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. \n \n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are currently no data available on the use of Adjupanrix in pregnancy.  \n \nAn AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v has been administered to women in each \ntrimester of pregnancy.  Information on outcomes from estimated more than 200,000 women who \nhave been vaccinated during pregnancy is currently limited. There was no evidence of an increased \nrisk of adverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that were followed in a prospective clinical study. \n \nAnimal studies with Adjupanrix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nData from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do \nnot suggest malformations or foetal or neonatal toxicity. \n \nThe use of Adjupanrix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking \ninto account official recommendations.  \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nAdjupanrix may be used in lactating women. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data are available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSome of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d may affect the ability to drive \nor operate machinery. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nClinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions listed below in approximately 5,000 \nsubjects 18 years old and above who received formulations containing at least 3.75 microgram \nHA/AS03.  \n \nList of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency: \n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common (\u22651/10) \nCommon (\u22651/100 to <1/10) \nUncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100) \nRare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) \nVery rare (<1/10,000) \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials with the pandemic preparedness vaccine are listed here below \n(see section 5.1 for more information on pandemic preparedness vaccines). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon: lymphadenopathy \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: insomnia \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common: headache \nUncommon: paraesthesia, somnolence, dizziness  \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nUncommon: gastro-intestinal symptoms (such as diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea) \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon: ecchymosis at the injection site, sweating increased \n\n\n\n6 \n\nUncommon: pruritus, rash \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nVery common: arthralgia, myalgia \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nVery common: induration, swelling, pain and redness at the injection site, fever, fatigue \nCommon: shivering, influenza like illness, injection site reactions (such as warmth, pruritus)  \nUncommon: malaise \n \nPaediatric population \n \nA clinical study (D-H5N1-009) evaluated the reactogenicity in children 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years of age \nwho received either two adult (i.e. 0.5 ml) doses or two half adult (i.e. 0.25 ml) doses (21 days apart) \nof Adjupanrix.  \n \nA difference in the frequency of local and general solicited adverse reactions between half adult and \nadult doses was observed after each dose. The administration of a second half adult or an adult dose \ndid not enhance the reactogenicity, except for rates of general symptoms which were higher after the \nsecond dose, particularly for rates of fever in <6 year olds. The per-dose frequency of adverse \nreactions was as follows: \n \nAdverse reactions 3-5 years 6-9 years \n Half dose Full dose Half dose Full dose \nInduration 9.9% 18.6% 12.0% 12.2% \nPain 48.5% 62.9% 68.0% 73.5% \nRedness 10.9% 19.6% 13.0% 6.1% \nSwelling 11.9% 24.7% 14.0% 20.4% \nFever (>38\u00b0C) 4.0% 11.3% 2.0% 17.3% \nFever (>39\u00b0C) \n- per-dose \n\nfrequency \n- per-subject \n\nfrequency \n\n \n2.0% \n\n \n3.9% \n\n \n5.2% \n\n \n10.2% \n\n \n0% \n\n \n0% \n\n \n7.1% \n\n \n14.3% \n\nDrowsiness 7.9% 13.4% NA NA \nIrritability 7.9% 18.6% NA NA \nLoss of appetite 6.9% 16.5% NA NA \nShivering 1.0% 12.4% 4.0% 14.3% \nNA=not available \n \nIn other clinical studies where children 6 months to 17 years received  zoonotic influenza vaccine \n(H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 manufactured in Dresden, Germany), increases in the frequency of some \nside effects (including injection site pain, redness and fever) were seen after the second dose in \nchildren aged less than 6 years. \n \n\u2022 Post-marketing surveillance \n \nNo post-marketing surveillance data are available following Adjupanrix administration. \n \nAS03-containing vaccines containing 3.75 \u00b5g HA derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) \n \nFrom post-marketing experience with AS03-containing vaccines containing 3.75 \u00b5g HA derived from \nA/California/7/2009 (H1N1), the following adverse reactions have been reported: \n \nImmune system disorders \nAnaphylaxis, allergic reactions \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNervous system disorders \nFebrile convulsions \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nAngioedema, generalised skin reactions, urticaria  \n \nInterpandemic trivalent vaccines \n \nIn addition, from post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following \nadverse reactions have been reported: \n \nRare:  \nNeuralgia, transient thrombocytopenia. \n \nVery rare: \nVasculitis with transient renal involvement. \nNeurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. \n \nThis medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and \ntherefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4). \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. \nIt allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code: J07BB02. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nThis section describes the clinical experience with the pandemic preparedness vaccines.  \n \nPandemic preparedness vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the \ncurrently circulating influenza viruses. These antigens can be considered as \u201cnovel\u201d antigens and \nsimulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically na\u00efve. Data \nobtained with the pandemic preparedness vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to \nbe used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained \nwith pandemic preparedness vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.   \n \nImmune response against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1): \n \nAdults aged 18-60 years \n \nIn clinical studies that evaluated the immunogenicity of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing 3.75 \u00b5g \nHA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in subjects aged 18-60 years the anti-haemagglutinin (anti-\nHA) antibody responses were as follows: \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nanti-HA antibody Immune response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 \n 0, 21 days schedule \n\n(D-Pan-H5N1-002) \n0, 6 months schedule \n(D-Pan-H5N1-012) \n\n 21 days after \n1st dose \nN=925 \n\n21 days after \n2nd dose \nN=924 \n\n21 days after \n1st dose \nN=55 \n\n7 days after \n2nd dose \nN=47 \n\n21 days after \n2nd dose \nN=48 \n\nSeroprotection rate1 44.5% 94.3% 38.2% 89.4% 89.6% \nSeroconversion rate2 42.5% 93.7% 38.2% 89.4% 89.6% \nSeroconversion factor3 4.1 39.8 3.1 38.2 54.2 \n1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre \u22651:40; \n2seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have \na protective post-vaccination titre of \u22651:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4-\nfold increase in titre;  \n3seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the pre-\nvaccination GMT. \n \nAfter two doses given 21 days or 6 months apart, 96.0% of subjects had a 4-fold increase in serum \nneutralising antibody titres and 98-100% had a titre of at least 1:80.  \n \nSubjects of D-Pan-H5N1-002 were followed up for persistence of the immune response.

Control \ngroups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) \nor phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the \nintra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous \nH5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected \nagainst the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper \nrespiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk \nof viral transmission.

Chemical and physical in-use stability has \nbeen demonstrated for 24 hours at 25\u00b0C. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0C). \nDo not freeze. \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \n \nFor storage conditions after mixing of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nOne pack containing: \n- one pack of 50 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml suspension with a stopper (butyl rubber). \n- two packs of 25 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml emulsion with a stopper (butyl rubber). \n \nThe volume after mixing 1 vial of suspension (2.5 ml) with 1 vial of emulsion (2.5 ml) corresponds to \n10 doses of vaccine (5 ml). \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nAdjupanrix consists of two containers:  \nSuspension: multidose vial containing the antigen,  \nEmulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.  \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \nPrior to administration, the two components should be mixed. \n \nInstructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine: \n \n1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be \n\nallowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken \nand inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. \nIn the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the \nvaccine. \n\n2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by \nmeans of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended \nto equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be \navailable, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained \nin upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.  \n\n3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed \nvaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion. In the event of other \nvariation being observed, discard the vaccine. \n\n4. The volume of the Adjupanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be \nadministered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). \n\n5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign \nparticulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed \n(including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. \n\n6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered \nintramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-\nG.  \n\n7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a \nrefrigerator (2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25\u00b0C. If the mixed vaccine is \nstored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature (for a minimum of 15 \nminutes) before each withdrawal. \n\n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING \n\nAUTHORISATION \n \n\u2022 Periodic Safety Update Reports  \n \nThe requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set \nout in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive \n2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. \n \nOutside of the pandemic period, the normal PSUR periodicity and format will be maintained, with a \nspecific review of AESI and possible adverse events related to adjuvants. This should include data \nfrom ongoing studies, or actual use if applicable, of the pandemic preparedness strains and any safety \ndata relevant to the adjuvant system. \n \nDuring a pandemic situation, the resources must be concentrated on a timely and effective monitoring \nof the safety profile of the influenza vaccines used during the pandemic.  Moreover, a 6-monthly cycle \nmay be too long to allow assessment of the safety of a vaccine for which high levels of exposure are \nexpected within a short period of time.  Therefore, 6-monthly or annual PSURs falling within the \npandemic period will be replaced by monthly \u201csimplified PSURs\u201d (S-PSUR) accompanied by a \nsummary of vaccine distribution. \n \nFrequency of submission \n \n- The clock should start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine. \n\n\n\n21 \n\n- First data-lock point is 30 days later. \n- S-PSUR submission to the Rapporteur and CHMP members on Day 45. \n- Rapporteur\u2019s assessment report is circulated to CHMP members on Day 50. \n- CHMP report is circulated to the vaccine manufacturer on Day 55. \n- Reporting to be monthly for the first 6 months. \n- Periodicity should be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 6 monthly intervals. \n \nWhen it has been agreed by the CHMP that the S-PSUR is no longer necessary, a full PSUR covering \nthe period since the data lock point of the last routine PSUR will be submitted within a time frame to \nbe agreed with the Rapporteur. \n \nFormat of the simplified PSUR \n \nOnly spontaneously reported data should be included in the PSUR. The report should include the \nfollowing Tables of aggregate data (using the pre-defined templates attached in Annex 2).   \n\n1. An overview for all spontaneous cases per country, stratified according to type of report \n(medically confirmed or non-medically confirmed) and seriousness, for the period covered by \nthe report and cumulatively.  \n\n \n2. An overview for all spontaneous adverse reactions by SOC, High Level Term (HLT) and \n\nPreferred Term (PT), stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed or non-\nmedically confirmed) and including the number of fatal reports, for the period covered by the \nreport and cumulatively. \n\n \n3. Adverse Events of Special Interest stratified according to type of report (medically confirmed \n\nor non-medically confirmed).

You may need to read it again. \n\u2022 If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\u2022 This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n\u2022 If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor.This includes any possible side effects not listed \n\nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n1. What Adjupanrix is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Adjupanrix \n3. How Adjupanrix is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Adjupanrix \n6. Contents of the pack and otherinformation \n \n \n1. What Adjupanrix is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Adjupanrix is and what it is used for \nAdjupanrix is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 years old to prevent pandemic flu (influenza). \n \nPandemic flu is a type of influenza that happens at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many \ndecades. It spreads rapidly around the world. The signs of pandemic flu are similar to those of \nordinary flu but may be more serious. \n \nHow Adjupanrix works \nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the body\u2019s natural defence system (immune system) produces its \nown protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \n \nAs with all vaccines, Adjupanrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Adjupanrix \n \nAdjupanrix should not be given \n\u2022 If you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this \n\nvaccine (listed in section 6) or to anything else that may be present in very small amounts, such \nas: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or \nsodium deoxycholate.  \n- Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of \n\nthe face or tongue.  \n- However, in a pandemic situation, you may still be given the vaccine. This is as long as \n\nmedical treatment is available straight away, in case you have an allergic reaction. \n \nDo not have Adjupanrix if any of the above apply to you.   \n \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. \n \nWarning and precautions: \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Adjupanrix  \n \n\u2022 if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any \n\ningredient of Adjupanrix (listed in section 6) or to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, \novalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. \n\n\u2022 if you have a serious infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C). If this applies to you then \nyour vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such \nas a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you could still be \nvaccinated with Adjupanrix. \n\n\u2022 if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be \npoor. \n\n\u2022 if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first \nfew weeks after vaccination with Adjupanrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell \nthe doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Adjupanrix. \n\n\u2022 you have a bleeding problem or you bruise easily. \n \nFainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if \nyou fainted with a previous injection. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having \nAdjupanrix.

Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures \nto lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each \ndose are recommended. \n \nOther medicines and Adjupanrix \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or \nhave recently received any other vaccine. \n \nIn particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are having any treatments (such as corticosteroid \ntreatments or chemotherapy for cancer) that affect the immune system. Adjupanrix can still be given \nbut your response to the vaccine may be poor. \n \nAdjupanrix is not intended to be given at the same time as some other vaccines. However, if this needs \nto happen, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm. Any side effects that happen may be \nmore serious.  \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before taking this vaccine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome side effects listed in Section 4. \u201cPossible side effects\u201d may affect your ability to drive or use \ntools or machines.
