NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMycamine 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nMycamine 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nMycamine 50 mg \n \nEach vial contains 50 mg micafungin (as sodium). \nAfter reconstitution each ml contains 10 mg micafungin (as sodium). \n \nMycamine 100 mg \n \nEach vial contains 100 mg micafungin (as sodium). \nAfter reconstitution each ml contains 20 mg micafungin (as sodium). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nWhite compact powder \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMycamine is indicated for: \n \nAdults, adolescents ≥ 16 years of age and elderly: \n- Treatment of invasive candidiasis. \n- Treatment of oesophageal candidiasis in patients for whom intravenous therapy is appropriate. \n- Prophylaxis of Candida infection in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplantation or patients who are expected to have neutropenia (absolute neutrophil \ncount < 500 cells / µl) for 10 or more days. \n\n \nChildren (including neonates) and adolescents < 16 years of age: \n- Treatment of invasive candidiasis. \n- Prophylaxis of Candida infection in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell \n\ntransplantation or patients who are expected to have neutropenia (absolute neutrophil \ncount < 500 cells / µl) for 10 or more days. \n\n \nThe decision to use Mycamine should take into account a potential risk for the development of liver \ntumours (see section 4.4). Mycamine should therefore only be used if other antifungals are not \nappropriate. \n \nConsideration should be given to official/national guidance on the appropriate use of antifungal \nagents. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Mycamine should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal \ninfections. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nPosology \n \nSpecimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (including histopathology) should \nbe obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organism(s). Therapy may be instituted \nbefore the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known. However, once these results \nbecome available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly. \n \nThe dose regimen of micafungin depends on the body weight of the patient as given in the following \ntables: \n \nUse in adults, adolescents ≥ 16 years of age and elderly \n \nIndication  \n Body weight > 40 kg Body weight ≤  40 kg \nTreatment of invasive candidiasis 100 mg/day* 2 mg/kg/day* \nTreatment of oesophageal candidiasis  150 mg/day 3 mg/kg/day \nProphylaxis of Candida infection 50 mg/day 1 mg/kg/day \n*If the patient’s response is inadequate, e.g. persistence of cultures or if clinical condition does not improve, the \ndose may be increased to 200 mg/day in patients weighing > 40 kg or 4 mg/kg/day in patients ≤ 40 kg. \n \nTreatment duration \nInvasive candidiasis: The treatment duration of Candida infection should be a minimum of 14 days. \nThe antifungal treatment should continue for at least one week after two sequential negative blood \ncultures have been obtained and after resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of infection. \n \nOesophageal candidiasis:  Micafungin should be administered for at least one week after resolution of \nclinical signs and symptoms. \n \nProphylaxis of Candida infections: Micafungin should be administered for at least one week after \nneutrophil recovery. \n \nUse in children ≥ 4 months of age up to adolescents < 16 years of age \n \nIndication  \n Body weight > 40 kg Body weight ≤  40 kg \nTreatment of invasive candidiasis  100 mg/day* 2 mg/kg/day* \nProphylaxis of Candida infection 50 mg/day 1 mg/kg/day \n*If the patient’s response is inadequate, e.g. persistence of cultures or if clinical condition does not improve, the \ndose may be increased to 200 mg/day in patients weighing > 40 kg or 4 mg/kg/day in patients weighing ≤  40 kg. \n \nUse in children (including neonates) < 4 months of age \n \nIndication  \nTreatment of invasive candidiasis 4 -10 mg/kg/day* \nProphylaxis of Candida infection 2 mg/kg/day \n*Micafungin dosed at 4 mg/kg in children less than 4 months approximates drug exposures achieved in adults \nreceiving 100 mg/day for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. If central nervous system (CNS) infection is \nsuspected, a higher dosage (e.g. 10 mg/kg) should be used due to the dose-dependent penetration of micafungin \ninto the CNS (see section 5.2). \n \nTreatment duration \nInvasive candidiasis: The treatment duration of Candida infection should be a minimum of 14 days. \nThe antifungal treatment should continue for at least one week after two sequential negative blood \ncultures have been obtained and after resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of infection. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nProphylaxis of Candida infections: Micafungin should be administered for at least one week after \nneutrophil recovery. Experience with Mycamine in patients less than 2 years of age is limited. \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see section \n5.2). There are currently insufficient data available for the use of micafungin in patients with severe \nhepatic impairment and its use is not recommended in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy in children (including neonates) less than 4 months of age of doses of 4 and 10 \nmg/kg for the treatment of invasive candidiasis with CNS involvement has not been adequately \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, 5.2. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nFor intravenous use. \nAfter reconstitution and dilution, the solution should be administered by intravenous infusion over \napproximately 1 hour. More rapid infusions may result in more frequent histamine mediated reactions. \nFor reconstitution instructions see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other echinocandins or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nHepatic effects: \nThe development of foci of altered hepatocytes (FAH) and hepatocellular tumours after a \ntreatment period of 3 months or longer were observed in rats. The assumed threshold for \ntumour development in rats is approximately in the range of clinical exposure. The clinical \nrelevance of this finding is not known. Liver function should be carefully monitored during \nmicafungin treatment. To minimise the risk of adaptive regeneration and potentially \nsubsequent liver tumour formation, early discontinuation in the presence of significant and \npersistent elevation of ALT/AST is recommended. Micafungin treatment should be \nconducted on a careful risk/benefit basis, particularly in patients having severe liver function \nimpairment or chronic liver diseases known to represent preneoplastic conditions, such as \nadvanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, neonatal liver disease or congenital enzyme \ndefects, or receiving a concomitant therapy including hepatotoxic and/or genotoxic \nproperties. \n\n \nMicafungin treatment was associated with significant impairment of liver function (increase of ALT, \nAST or total bilirubin > 3 times ULN) in both healthy volunteers and patients. In some patients more \nsevere hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure including fatal cases have been reported. \nPaediatric patients < 1 year of age might be more prone to liver injury (see section 4.8). \n \nAnaphylactic reactions \n \nDuring administration of micafungin, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, may \noccur. If these reactions occur, micafungin infusion should be discontinued and appropriate treatment \nadministered. \n \nSkin reactions \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nExfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis \nhave been reported. If patients develop a rash they should be monitored closely and micafungin \ndiscontinued if lesions progress. \n \nHaemolysis \n \nRare cases of haemolysis, including acute intravascular haemolysis or haemolytic anaemia, have been \nreported in patients treated with micafungin. Patients who develop clinical or laboratory evidence of \nhaemolysis during micafungin therapy should be monitored closely for evidence of worsening of these \nconditions and evaluated for the risk/benefit of continuing micafungin therapy. \n \nRenal effects \n \nMicafungin may cause kidney problems, renal failure, and abnormal renal function test. Patients \nshould be closely monitored for worsening of renal function. \n \nInteractions with other medicinal products \n \nCo-administration of micafungin and amphotericin B desoxycholate should only be used when the \nbenefits clearly outweigh the risks, with close monitoring of amphotericin B desoxycholate toxicities \n(see section 4.5). \n \nPatients receiving sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole in combination with micafungin should be \nmonitored for sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole toxicity and the sirolimus, nifedipine or \nitraconazole dosage should be reduced if necessary (see section 4.5). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe incidence of some adverse reactions was higher in paediatric patients than in adult patients (see \nsection 4.8). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nMicafungin has a low potential for interactions with medicines metabolised via CYP3A mediated \npathways. \n \nDrug interaction studies in healthy human subjects were conducted to evaluate the potential for \ninteraction between micafungin and mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, prednisolone, \nsirolimus, nifedipine, fluconazole, ritonavir, rifampicin, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin \nB. In these studies, no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics of micafungin was observed. No \nmicafungin dose adjustments are necessary when these medicines are administered concomitantly. \nExposure (AUC) of itraconazole, sirolimus and nifedipine was slightly increased in the presence of \nmicafungin (22%, 21% and 18% respectively). \n \nCo-administration of micafungin and amphotericin B desoxycholate was associated with a 30% \nincrease in amphotericin B desoxycholate exposure. Since this may be of clinical significance this co-\nadministration should only be used when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, with close monitoring \nof amphotericin B desoxycholate toxicities (see section 4.4). \n \nPatients receiving sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole in combination with micafungin should be \nmonitored for sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole toxicity and the sirolimus, nifedipine or \nitraconazole dosage should be reduced if necessary (see section 4.4). \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nThere are no data from the use of micafungin in pregnant women. In animal studies micafungin \ncrossed the placental barrier and reproductive toxicity was seen (see section 5.3). The potential risk for \nhumans is unknown. \nMycamine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether micafungin is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown \nexcretion of micafungin in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding \nor to continue/discontinue therapy with Mycamine should be made taking into account the benefit of \nbreast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Mycamine therapy to the mother. \n \nFertility \n \nTesticular toxicity was observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). Micafungin may have the \npotential to affect male fertility in humans. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMicafungin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, patients \nshould be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with micafungin (see section \n4.8). \n \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBased on clinical trial experience, overall 32.2% of the patients experienced adverse drug reactions. \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea (2.8%), blood alkaline phosphatase \nincreased (2.7%), phlebitis (2.5%, primarily in HIV infected patients with peripheral lines), vomiting \n(2.5%), and aspartate aminotransferase increased (2.3%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn the following table adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and MedDRA preferred term. \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000 \n\nNot known \n(frequency \ncannot be \n\nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nBlood and \nlymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nleukopenia, \nneutropenia, anaemia \n\npancytopenia, \nthrombocytopenia, \neosinophilia, \nhypoalbuminaemia \n\nhaemolytic \nanaemia, \nhaemolysis \n(see section \n4.4) \n\ndisseminated \nintravascular \ncoagulation \n\nImmune system \ndisorders \n\n anaphylactic / \nanaphylactoid \nreaction (see section \n4.4), hypersensitivity \n\n anaphylactic \nand \nanaphylactoid \nshock (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nEndocrine \ndisorders \n\n hyperhidrosis   \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000 \n\nNot known \n(frequency \ncannot be \n\nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nMetabolism and \nnutritional \ndisorders \n\nhypokalaemia, \nhypomagnesaemia, \nhypocalcaemia \n\nhyponatraemia, \nhyperkalaemia, \nhypophosphataemia, \nanorexia \n\n  \n\nPsychiatric \ndisorders \n\n insomnia, anxiety, \nconfusion \n\n  \n\nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache somnolence, tremor, \ndizziness, dysgeusia \n\n  \n\nCardiac disorders  tachycardia, \npalpitations, \nbradycardia \n\n  \n\nVascular \ndisorders \n\nphlebitis hypotension, \nhypertension, \nflushing \n\n shock \n\nRespiratory, \nthoracic and \nmediastinal \ndisorders \n\n dyspnoea   \n\nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\nnausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhoea, abdominal \npain \n\ndyspepsia, \nconstipation \n\n  \n\nHepatobiliary \ndisorders \n\nblood alkaline \nphosphatase increased, \naspartate \naminotransferase \nincreased, alanine \naminotransferase \nincreased, blood \nbilirubin increased \n(including \nhyperbilirubinaemia), \nliver function test \nabnormal \n\nhepatic failure (see \nsection 4.4), gamma-\nglutamyltransferase \nincreased, jaundice, \ncholestasis, \nhepatomegaly, \nhepatitis \n\n hepatocellular \ndamage \nincluding fatal \ncases (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nSkin and \nsubcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\nrash urticaria, pruritus, \nerythema \n\n toxic skin \neruption, \nerythema \nmultiforme, \nStevens-\nJohnson \nsyndrome, \ntoxic \nepidermal \nnecrolysis (see \nsection 4.4) \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n blood creatinine \nincreased, blood urea \nincreased, renal \nfailure aggravated \n\n renal \nimpairment \n(see section \n4.4), acute \nrenal failure \n\n\n\n8 \n\nSystem Organ \nClass \n\nCommon \n≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \n\nUncommon \n≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \n\nRare \n≥ 1/10,000 to \n\n< 1/1,000 \n\nNot known \n(frequency \ncannot be \n\nestimated from \navailable data) \n\nGeneral disorders \nand \nadministration \nsite conditions \n\npyrexia, rigors injection site \nthrombosis, infusion \nsite inflammation, \ninjection site pain, \nperipheral oedema \n\n  \n\nInvestigations  blood lactate \ndehydrogenase \nincreased \n\n  \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nPossible allergic-like symptoms \nSymptoms such as rash and rigors have been reported in clinical studies. The majority were of mild to \nmoderate intensity and not treatment limiting. Serious reactions (e.g. anaphylactoid reaction 0.2%, \n6/3028) were uncommonly reported during therapy with micafungin and only in patients with serious \nunderlying conditions (e.g. advanced AIDS, malignancies) requiring multiple co-medications. \n \nHepatic adverse reactions \nThe overall incidence of hepatic adverse reactions in the patients treated with micafungin in clinical \nstudies was 8.6% (260/3028). The majority of hepatic adverse reactions were mild and moderate. Most \nfrequent reactions were increase in AP (2.7%), AST (2.3%), ALT (2.0%), blood bilirubin (1.6%) and \nliver function test abnormal (1.5%). Few patients (1.1%; 0.4% serious) discontinued treatment due to a \nhepatic event. Cases of serious hepatic dysfunction occurred uncommonly (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection-site reactions \nNone of the injection-site adverse reactions were treatment limiting. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe incidence of some adverse reactions (listed in the table below) was higher in paediatric patients \nthan in adult patients. Additionally, paediatric patients < 1 year of age experienced about two times \nmore often an increase in ALT, AST and AP than older paediatric patients (see section 4.4). The most \nlikely reason for these differences were different underlying conditions compared with adults or older \npaediatric patients observed in clinical studies. At the time of entering the study, the proportion of \npaediatric patients with neutropenia was several-fold higher than in adult patients (40.2% and 7.3% of \nchildren and adults, respectively), as well as allogeneic HSCT (29.4% and 13.4%, respectively) and \nhaematological malignancy (29.1% and 8.7%, respectively). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \ncommon thrombocytopenia \n \nCardiac disorders \n\n \n\ncommon tachycardia \n \nVascular disorders \n\n \n\ncommon hypertension, hypotension \n \nHepatobiliary disorders \n\n \n\ncommon hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatomegaly \n \nRenal and urinary disorders \n\n \n\ncommon acute renal failure, blood urea increased \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nRepeated daily doses up to 8 mg/kg (maximum total dose 896 mg) in adult patients have been \nadministered in clinical trials with no reported dose-limiting toxicity. In one spontaneous case, it was \nreported a dosage of 16 mg/kg/day was administered in a newborn patient. No adverse reactions \nassociated with this high dose were noted. \nThere is no experience with overdoses of micafungin. In case of overdose, general supportive \nmeasures and symptomatic treatment should be administered. Micafungin is highly protein-bound and \nnot dialysable. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antimycotics for systemic use, other antimycotics for systemic use, ATC \ncode: J02AX05 \n \nMode of action \nMicafungin non-competitively inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-β-D-glucan, an essential component of the \nfungal cell wall. 1,3-β-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. \nMicafungin exhibits fungicidal activity against most Candida species and prominently inhibits \nactively growing hyphae of Aspergillus species. \n \nPK/PD relationship \n \nIn animals models of candidiasis, a correlation was observed between exposure of micafungin divided \nby MIC (AUC/MIC) and efficacy defined as the ratio required to prevent progressive fungal growth. A \nratio of ~2400 and ~1300 was required for C. albicans and C. glabrata, respectively, in these models. \nAt the recommended therapeutic dosage of Mycamine, these ratios are achievable for the wild-type \ndistribution of Candida spp. \n \nMechanism(s) of resistance \n \nAs for all antimicrobial agents, cases of reduced susceptibility and resistance have been reported and \ncross-resistance with other echinocandins cannot be excluded. Reduced susceptibility to echinocandins \nhas been associated with mutations in the Fks1 and Fks2 genes coding for a major subunit of glucan \nsynthase. \n \nBreakpoints \n \nEUCAST breakpoints \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCandida species MIC breakpoint (mg/L) \n≤S (Susceptible) >R (Resistant) \n\nCandida albicans 0.016 0.016 \nCandida glabrata  0.03 0.03 \nCandida parapsilosis 0.002 2 \nCandida tropicalis 1 Insufficient evidence \nCandida krusei1 Insufficient evidence \nCandida guilliermondii1 Insufficient evidence \nOther Candida spp. Insufficient evidence \n1 MICs for C. tropicalis are 1-2 two-fold dilution steps higher than for C  albicans and C. glabrata. In \nthe clinical study, successful outcome was numerically slightly lower for C. tropicalis than for C. \nalbicans at both dosages (100 and 150 mg daily). However, the difference was not significant and \nwhether it translates into a relevant clinical difference is unknown. MICs for C. krusei are \napproximately 3 two-fold dilution steps higher than those for C. albicans and, similarly, those for C. \nguilliermondii are approximately 8 two-fold dilutions higher. In addition, only a small number of cases \ninvolved these species in the clinical trials. This means there is insufficient evidence to indicate \nwhether the wild-type population of these pathogens can be considered susceptible to micafungin. \n \nInformation from clinical studies \n \nCandidaemia and Invasive Candidiasis: Micafungin (100 mg/day or 2 mg/kg/day) was as effective as \nand better tolerated than liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg) as first-line treatment of candidaemia \nand invasive candidiasis in a randomised, double-blind, multinational non-inferiority study. \nMicafungin and liposomal amphotericin B were received for a median duration of 15 days (range, 4 to \n42 days in adults; 12 to 42 days in children). \nNon-inferiority was proven for adult patients, and similar findings were demonstrated for the \npaediatric subpopulations (including neonates and premature infants). Efficacy findings were \nconsistent, independent of the infective Candida species, primary site of infection and neutropenic \nstatus (see Table). Micafungin demonstrated a smaller mean peak decrease in estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate during treatment (p<0.001) and a lower incidence of infusion-related reactions (p=0.001) \nthan liposomal amphotericin B. \n \n\n Overall Treatment Success in the Per Protocol Set, Invasive Candidiasis Study \n Micafungin Liposomal \n\nAmphotericin B \n% Difference \n\n[95% CI]  \nN n (%) N n (%)  \n\nAdult Patients \nOverall Treatment Success 202 181 (89.6) 190 170 (89.5) 0.1 [-5.9, 6.1] † \nOverall Treatment Success by Neutropenic Status \n Neutropenia at baseline 24 18 (75.0) 15 12 (80.0) 0.7 [-5.3, 6.7] ‡ \n No neutropenia at baseline 178 163 (91.6) 175 158 (90.3) \nPaediatric Patients \nOverall Treatment Success 48 35 (72.9) 50 38 (76.0) -2.7 [-17.3, 11.9] § \n < 2 years old 26 21 (80.8) 31 24 (77.4) \n Premature Infants 10 7 (70.0) 9 6 (66.7) \n Neonates (0 days to \n\n< 4 weeks) \n7 7 (100) 5 4 (80) \n\n 2 to 15 years old 22 14 (63.6) 19 14 (73.7) \nAdults and Children Combined, Overall Treatment Success by Candida Species  \nCandida albicans 102 91 (89.2) 98 89 (90.8)  \nNon-albicans species ¶: all 151 133 (88.1) 140 123 (87.9) \n C. tropicalis 59 54 (91.5) 51 49 (96.1) \n C. parapsilosis 48 41 (85.4) 44 35 (79.5) \n C. glabrata 23 19 (82.6) 17 14 (82.4)  \n\n\n\n11 \n\n C. krusei 9 8 (88.9) 7 6 (85.7)  \n† Micafungin rate minus the liposomal amphotericin B rate, and 2-sided 95% confidence interval for \nthe difference in overall success rate based on large sample normal approximation. \n‡ Adjusted for neutropenic status; primary endpoint. \n§ The paediatric population was not sized to test for non-inferiority. \n¶ Clinical efficacy was also observed (< 5 patients) in the following Candida species: C. guilliermondii, C. \nfamata, C. lusitaniae, C. utilis, C. inconspicua and C. dubliniensis. \n\n \nOesophageal Candidiasis: In a randomised, double-blind study of micafungin versus fluconazole in \nthe first-line treatment of oesophageal candidiasis, 518 patients received at least a single dose of study \ndrug. The median treatment duration was 14 days and the median average daily dose was 150 mg for \nmicafungin (N=260) and 200 mg for fluconazole (N=258). An endoscopic grade of 0 (endoscopic \ncure) at the end of treatment was observed for 87.7% (228/260) and 88.0% (227/258) of patients in the \nmicafungin and fluconazole groups, respectively (95% CI for difference: [-5.9%, 5.3%]). The lower \nlimit of the 95% CI was above the predefined non-inferiority margin of -10%, proving non-inferiority. \nThe nature and incidence of adverse events were similar between treatment groups. \n \nProphylaxis: Micafungin was more effective than fluconazole in preventing invasive fungal infections \nin a population of patients at high risk of developing a systemic fungal infection (patients undergoing \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study). \nTreatment success was defined as the absence of a proven, probable, or suspected systemic fungal \ninfection through the end of therapy and absence of a proven or probable systemic fungal infection \nthrough the end of study. Most patients (97%, N=882) had neutropenia at baseline (< 200 \nneutrophils/µL). Neutropenia persisted for a median of 13 days. There was a fixed daily dose of 50 mg \n(1.0 mg/kg) for micafungin and 400 mg (8 mg/kg) for fluconazole. The mean period of treatment was \n19 days for micafungin and 18 days for fluconazole in the adult population (N=798) and 23 days for \nboth treatment arms in the paediatric population (N=84). \nThe rate of treatment success was statistically significantly higher for micafungin than fluconazole \n(1.6% versus 2.4% breakthrough infections). Breakthrough Aspergillus infections were observed in 1 \nversus 7 patients, and proven or probable breakthrough Candida infections were observed in 4 versus \n2 patients in the micafungin and fluconazole groups, respectively. Other breakthrough infections were \ncaused by Fusarium (1 and 2 patients, respectively) and Zygomycetes (1 and 0 patients, respectively). \nThe nature and incidence of adverse reactions were similar between treatment groups. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nPharmacokinetics are linear over the daily dose range of 12.5 mg to 200 mg and 3 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. \nThere is no evidence of systemic accumulation with repeated administration and steady-state is \ngenerally reached within 4 to 5 days. \n \nDistribution \n \nFollowing intravenous administration concentrations of micafungin show a biexponential decline. The \ndrug is rapidly distributed into tissues. \nIn systemic circulation, micafungin is highly bound to plasma protein (> 99%), primarily to albumin. \nBinding to albumin is independent of micafungin concentration (10-100 µg/ml). \nThe volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was approximately 18-19 litres. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nUnchanged micafungin is the principal circulating compound in systemic circulation. Micafungin has \nbeen shown to be metabolised to several compounds; of these M-1 (catechol form), M-2 (methoxy \nform of M-1) and M-5 (hydroxylation at the side chain) of micafungin have been detected in systemic \ncirculation. Exposure to these metabolites is low and metabolites do not contribute to the overall \nefficacy of micafungin.  \n\n\n\n12 \n\nEven though micafungin is a substrate for CYP3A in vitro, hydroxylation by CYP3A is not a major \npathway for micafungin metabolism in vivo. \n \nElimination and excretion \n \nThe mean terminal half-life is approximately 10-17 hours and stays consistent across doses up to \n8 mg/kg and after single and repeated administration. Total clearance was 0.15-0.3 ml/min/kg in \nhealthy subjects and adult patients and is independent of dose after single and repeated administration. \nFollowing a single intravenous dose of 14C-micafungin (25 mg) to healthy volunteers, 11.6% of the \nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and 71.0% in the faeces over 28 days. These data indicate that \nelimination of micafungin is primarily non-renal. In plasma, metabolites M-1 and M-2 were detected \nonly at trace concentrations and metabolite M-5, the more abundant metabolite, accounted for a total \nof 6.5% relative to parent compound. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nPaediatric patients: In paediatric patients AUC values were dose proportional over the dose range of \n0.5-4 mg/kg. Clearance was influenced by weight, with mean values of weight-adjusted clearance 1.35 \ntimes higher in the younger children (4 months to 5 years) and 1.14 times higher in paediatric patients \naged 6 to 11 years. Older children (12-16 years) had mean clearance values similar to those \ndetermined in adult patients. Mean weight-adjusted clearance in children less than 4 months of age is \napproximately 2.6-fold greater than older children (12-16 years) and 2.3-fold greater than in adults. \n \nPK/PD bridging study demonstrated dose-dependent penetration of micafungin into CNS with the \nminimum AUC of 170 µg*hr/L required to achieve maximum eradication of fungal burden in the CNS \ntissues. Population PK modeling demonstrated that a dose of 10 mg/kg in children less than 4 month \nof age would be sufficient to achieve the target exposure for the treatment of CNS Candida infections. \n \nElderly: When administered as a single 1-hour infusion of 50 mg the pharmacokinetics of micafungin \nin the elderly (aged 66-78 years) were similar to those in young (20-24 years) subjects. No dose \nadjustment is necessary for the elderly. \n \nPatients with hepatic impairment: In a study performed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh score 7-9), (n=8), the pharmacokinetics of micafungin did not significantly differ from \nthose in healthy subjects (n=8). Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to \nmoderate hepatic impairment. In a study performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-\nPugh score 10-12) (n=8), lower plasma concentrations of micafungin and higher plasma \nconcentrations of the hydroxide metabolite (M-5) were seen compared to healthy subjects (n=8). \nThese data are insufficient to support a dosing recommendation in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment. \n \nPatients with renal impairment: Severe renal impairment (Glomerular Filtration Rate [GFR] < 30 \nml/min) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of micafungin. No dose adjustment is \nnecessary for patients with renal impairment. \n \nGender/Race: Gender and race (Caucasian, Black and Oriental) did not significantly influence the \npharmacokinetic parameters of micafungin. No dose adjustment of micafungin is required based on \ngender or race. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe development of foci of altered hepatocytes (FAH) and hepatocellular tumours in rats was \ndependent on both dose and duration of micafungin treatment. FAH recorded after treatment for 13 \nweeks or longer persisted after a 13-week withdrawal period and developed into hepatocellular \ntumours following a treatment free period which covered the life span of rats. No standard \ncarcinogenicity studies have been conducted but the development of FAH was assessed in female rats \nafter up to 20 and 18 months after cessation of a 3 and 6 month treatment, respectively. In both studies \n\n\n\n13 \n\nincreased incidences/numbers of hepatocellular tumours were observed after the 18 and 20 month \ntreatment free period in the high dose group of 32 mg/kg/day as well as in a lower dose group \n(although not statistically significant). The plasma exposure at the assumed threshold for tumour \ndevelopment in rats (i.e. the dose where no FAH and liver tumours were detected) was in the same \nrange as the clinical exposure. The relevance of the hepatocarcinogenic potential of micafungin for the \nhuman therapeutic use is not known. \n \nThe toxicology of micafungin following repeated intravenous dosing in rats and/or dogs showed \nadverse responses in liver, urinary tract, red blood cells, and male reproductive organs. The exposure \nlevels at which these effects did not occur (NOAEL) were in the same range as the clinical exposure or \nlower. Consequently, the occurrence of these adverse responses may be expected in human clinical use \nof micafungin. \n \nIn standard safety pharmacology tests, cardiovascular and histamine releasing effects of micafungin \nwere evident and appeared to be time above threshold dependent. Prolongation of infusion time \nreducing the plasma concentration peak appeared to reduce these effects. \n \nIn repeated dose toxicity studies in rat signs of hepatotoxicity consisted of increased liver enzymes and \ndegenerative changes of hepatocytes which were accompanied by signs of compensatory regeneration. \nIn dog, liver effects consisted of increased weight and centrilobular hypertrophy, no degenerative \nchanges of hepatocytes were observed. \n \nIn rats, vacuolation of the renal pelvic epithelium as well as vacuolation and thickening (hyperplasia) \nof the bladder epithelium were observed in 26-week repeat dose studies. In a second 26-week study \nhyperplasia of transitional cells in the urinary bladder occurred with a much lower incidence. These \nfindings showed reversibility over a follow-up period of 18 months. The duration of micafungin \ndosing in these rat studies (6 months) exceeds the usual duration of micafungin dosing in patients (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nMicafungin haemolysed rabbit blood in vitro. In rats, signs of haemolytic anaemia were observed after \nrepeated bolus injection of micafungin. In repeat dose studies in dogs, haemolytic anaemia was not \nobserved. \n \nIn reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, reduced birth weight of the pups was noted. One \nabortion occurred in rabbits at 32 mg/kg/day. Male rats treated intravenously for 9 weeks showed \nvacuolation of the epididymal ductal epithelial cells, increased epididymis weights and reduced \nnumber of sperm cells (by 15%), however, in studies of 13 and 26 weeks duration these changes did \nnot occur. In adult dogs, atrophy of seminiferous tubules with vacuolation of the seminiferous \nepithelium and decreased sperm in the epididymides were noted after prolonged treatment (39 weeks) \nbut not after 13 weeks of treatment. In juvenile dogs, 39 weeks treatment did not induce lesions in the \ntestis and epididymides in a dose dependent manner at the end of treatment but after a treatment free \nperiod of 13 weeks a dose dependent increase in these lesions were noted in the treated recovery \ngroups. No impairment of male or female fertility was observed in the fertility and early embryonic \ndevelopment study in rats. \n \nMicafungin was not mutagenic or clastogenic when evaluated in a standard battery of in vitro and in \nvivo tests, including an in vitro study on unscheduled DNA synthesis using rat hepatocytes. \n \n \n6.

OTHER CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARKETING \n\nAUTHORISATION \n \n• Periodic Safety Update Reports \n \nThe requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set \nout in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive \n2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. \n \nD. CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND \nEFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n• Risk Management Plan (RMP) \nThe MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the \nagreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent \nupdates of the RMP. \n \nAn updated RMP should be submitted \n• At the request of the European Medicines Agency.  \n• Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information \n\nbeing received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of \nan important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. \n\n \n \n• Additional risk minimisation measures \nThe MAH shall ensure that prior to prescribing of the product prescribers will receive the \nprescriber checklist. \n \n \nThe MAH should agree the final content, format and distribution modalities of the Prescriber \nchecklist with the National Competent Authority in each Member State and ensure that the \nmaterials contain the key elements as described below. \n \nPrescriber checklist \n• The decision to use Mycamine should take into account a potential risk for the development of \n\nliver tumours. Mycamine should therefore only be used if other antifungals are not appropriate \n• Caution must be demonstrated if the patient: \n - has severe liver function impairment \n - has chronic liver diseases known to represent preneoplastic conditions (e.g. advanced liver \n\nfibrosis, cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, neonatal liver disease or congenital enzyme defects) \n - is receiving a concomitant therapy including hepatotoxic and/or genotoxic properties \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n - has history of haemolysis, haemolytic anaemia or renal impairment. \n• Patients should be carefully monitored for liver damage and for worsening of renal function. \n• To minimise the risk of adaptive regeneration and potentially subsequent liver tumour \n\nformation, early discontinuation in the presence of significant and persistent elevation of \nALT/AST is recommended. \n\n• Patients who develop clinical or laboratory evidence of haemolysis during micafungin therapy \nshould be monitored closely for evidence of worsening of these conditions and evaluated for the \nbenefit/risk of continuing micafungin therapy. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nANNEX III \n \n\nLABELLING AND PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nMycamine 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nMycamine 100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n\n \nmicafungin \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Mycamine is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Mycamine \n3. How to use Mycamine \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Mycamine \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Mycamine is and what it is used for \n \nMycamine contains the active substance micafungin. Mycamine is called an antifungal medicine \nbecause it is used to treat infections caused by fungal cells. \nMycamine is used to treat fungal infections caused by fungal or yeast cells called Candida. Mycamine \nis effective in treating systemic infections (those that have penetrated within the body). It interferes \nwith the production of a part of the fungal cell wall. An intact cell wall is necessary for the fungus to \ncontinue living and growing. Mycamine causes defects in the fungal cell wall, making the fungus \nunable to live and grow. \n \nYour doctor has prescribed Mycamine for you in the following circumstances when there are no other \nsuitable antifungal treatments available (see section 2): \n \n• To treat adults, adolescents and children including neonates who have a serious fungal infection \n\ncalled invasive candidiasis (infection that has penetrated the body). \n• To treat adults and adolescents ≥ 16 years of age who have a fungal infection in the gullet \n\n(oesophagus) where treatment into a vein (intravenous) is appropriate. \n• To prevent infection with Candida in patients who are having a bone-marrow transplant or who \n\nare expected to have a neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) for 10 \ndays or more. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Mycamine \n \nDo not use Mycamine \n- if you are allergic  to micafungin, other echinocandins (Ecalta or Cancidas) or any of the other \n\ningredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n \nWarnings and precautions \nIn rats, long-term treatment with micafungin led to liver damage and subsequent liver tumours. The \npotential risk of developing liver tumours in humans is not known, and your doctor will assess the \nbenefits and risks of Mycamine treatment before starting your medicine. Please tell your doctor if you \nhave severe liver problems (e.g. liver failure or hepatitis) or have had abnormal liver function tests. \nDuring treatment your liver functions will be monitored more closely. \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Mycamine \n- if you are allergic to any medicine \n- if you have haemolytic anaemia (anaemia due to breakdown of red blood cells) or haemolysis \n\n(breakdown of red blood cells). \n- if you have kidney problems (e.g. kidney failure and abnormal kidney function test). If this \n\nhappens, your doctor may decide to monitor your kidney function more closely. \n \nMicafungin may also cause severe inflammation/eruption of the skin and mucous membranes \n(Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis). \n \nOther medicines and Mycamine \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt is especially important to inform your doctor if you are using amphotericin B desoxycholate or \nitraconazole (antifungal antibiotics), sirolimus (an immunosuppressant) or nifedipine (calcium channel \nblocker used to treat high blood pressure). Your doctor may decide to adjust the dose of these \nmedicines. \n \nMycamine with food and drink \nAs Mycamine is given intravenously (into a vein), no restrictions on food or drink are required. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant of breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \nMycamine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If you use Mycamine you \nshould not breast-feed. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMicafungin is unlikely to have an effect on driving or using machines. However some people may feel \ndizzy when taking this medicine and if this happens to you, do not drive or use any tools or machines. \nPlease inform your doctor if you experience any effects that may cause you to have problems with \ndriving or using other machinery. \n \nMycamine contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-\nfree’. \n \n \n3. How to use Mycamine \n \nMycamine must be prepared and given to you by a doctor or another healthcare professional. \nMycamine should be administered once daily by slow intravenous (into a vein) infusion. Your doctor \nwill determine how much Mycamine you will receive each day.  \n \nUse in adults, adolescents ≥ 16 years of age and elderly \n- The usual dose to treat an invasive Candida infection is 100 mg per day for patients weighing \n\n40 kg or more and 2 mg/kg per day for patients weighing 40 kg or less. \n- The dose to treat a Candida infection of the oesophagus is 150 mg for patients weighing more \n\nthan 40 kg and 3 mg/kg per day for patients weighing 40 kg or less. \n- The usual dose to prevent invasive Candida infections is 50 mg per day for patients weighing \n\nmore than 40 kg and 1 mg/kg per day for patients weighing 40 kg or less. \n \nUse in children > 4 months of age and adolescents < 16 years of age \n- The usual dose to treat an invasive Candida infection is 100 mg per day for patients weighing \n\n40 kg or more and 2 mg/kg per day for patients weighing 40 kg or less. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n- The usual dose to prevent invasive Candida infections is 50 mg per day for patients weighing \nmore than 40 kg and 1 mg/kg per day for patients weighing 40 kg or less. \n \n\nUse in children and newborns < 4 months of age \n- The usual dose to treat an invasive Candida infection is 4-10 mg/kg per day. \n- The usual dose to prevent invasive Candida infections is 2 mg/kg per day. \n \nIf you receive more Mycamine than you should \nYour doctor monitors your response and condition to determine what dose of Mycamine is needed. \nHowever, if you are concerned that you may have been given too much Mycamine, speak to your \ndoctor or another healthcare professional immediately. \n \nIf you miss a dose of Mycamine \nYour doctor monitors your response and condition to determine what Mycamine treatment is needed. \nHowever, if you are concerned that you may have missed a dose, speak to your doctor or another \nhealthcare professional immediately. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

Using aseptic techniques at room temperature, Mycamine is reconstituted and diluted as \nfollows: \n \n1. The plastic cap must be removed from the vial and the stopper disinfected with alcohol. \n2. Five ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion or glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) \n\nsolution for infusion (taken from a 100 ml bottle/bag) should be aseptically and slowly injected \ninto each vial along the side of the inner wall. Although the concentrate will foam, every effort \nshould be made to minimise the amount of foam generated. A sufficient number of vials of \nMycamine must be reconstituted to obtain the required dose in mg (see table below). \n\n3. The vial should be rotated gently. DO NOT SHAKE. The powder will dissolve completely. The \nconcentrate should be used immediately. The vial is for single use only. Therefore, unused \nreconstituted concentrate must be discarded immediately. \n\n4. All of the reconstituted concentrate should be withdrawn from each vial and returned into the \ninfusion bottle/bag from which it was originally taken. The diluted infusion solution should be \nused immediately. Chemical and physical in-use stability have been demonstrated for 96 hours \nat 25°C when protected from light and diluted as described above. \n\n5. The infusion bottle/bag should be gently inverted to disperse the diluted solution but NOT \nagitated in order to avoid foaming. The solution must not be used if it is cloudy or has \nprecipitated. \n\n6.
