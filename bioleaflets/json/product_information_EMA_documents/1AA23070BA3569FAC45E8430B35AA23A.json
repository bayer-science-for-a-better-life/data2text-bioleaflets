NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n\nDaTSCAN 74 MBq/ml solution for injection \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n\nEach ml of solution contains ioflupane (123I) 74 MBq at reference time (0.07 to 0.13 μg/ml of ioflupane).  \n\n \n\nEach 2.5 ml single dose vial contains 185 MBq ioflupane (123I) (specific activity range 2.5 to  \n\n4.5 x 1014 Bq/mmol) at reference time. \n\nEach 5 ml single dose vial contains 370 MBq ioflupane (123I) (specific activity range 2.5 to  \n\n4.5 x 1014 Bq/mmol) at reference time.   \n\n \n\nExcipient(s) with known effect \n\nThis medicinal product contains 39.5 g/l ethanol. \n\nFor the full list of excipients see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\nClear colourless solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n\n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN is indicated for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum: \n\n \n\n• In adult patients with clinically uncertain Parkinsonian Syndromes, for example those with early \n\nsymptoms, in order to help differentiate Essential Tremor from Parkinsonian Syndromes related \n\nto idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.  \n\nDaTSCAN is unable to discriminate between Parkinson's Disease, Multiple System Atrophy and \n\nProgressive Supranuclear Palsy. \n\n• In adult patients, to help differentiate probable dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer’s \n\ndisease. \n\nDaTSCAN is unable to discriminate between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease \n\ndementia. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nPrior to administration appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available. \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN should only be used in adult patients referred by physicians experienced in the management \n\nof movement disorders and/or dementia. DaTSCAN should only be used by qualified personnel with the \n\nappropriate government authorisation for the use and manipulation of radionuclides within a designated \n\nclinical setting. \n\n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy has been demonstrated across the range 111 to 185 MBq. Do not exceed 185 MBq and \n\ndo not use when the activity is below 110 MBq.  \n\n \n\nPatients must undergo appropriate thyroid blocking treatment prior to injection to minimise thyroid \n\nuptake of radioactive iodine, for example by oral administration of approximately 120 mg potassium \n\niodide 1 to 4 hours prior to injection of DaTSCAN. \n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\n \n\nRenal and hepatic impairment \n\nFormal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment.  No \n\ndata are available (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of DaTSCAN in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established.  No data \n\nare available. \n\n \n\nMethod of Administration \n\nFor intravenous use.  \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN should be used without dilution. To minimise the potential for pain at the injection site \n\nduring administration, a slow intravenous injection (not less than 15 to 20 seconds) via an arm vein is \n\nrecommended. \n\n \n\nSPECT imaging should take place between three and six hours post-injection. Images should be \n\nacquired using a gamma camera fitted with a high-resolution collimator and calibrated using the \n\n159 keV photopeak and a ± 10% energy window. Angular sampling should preferably be not less than \n\n120 views over 360 degrees. For high resolution collimators the radius of rotation should be consistent \n\nand set as small as possible (typically 11-15cm). Experimental studies with a striatal phantom, suggest \n\nthat optimal images are obtained with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of \n\n3.5-4.5 mm for those systems currently in use. A minimum of 500k counts should be collected for \n\noptimal images. Normal images are characterised by two symmetrical crescent-shaped areas of equal \n\nintensity. Abnormal images are either asymmetric or symmetric with unequal intensity and/or loss of \n\ncrescent. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n \n\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n- Pregnancy (see section 4.6). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n\n \n\nIf hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be discontinued \n\nimmediately and, if necessary, intravenous treatment initiated.  Resuscitative medicinal products and \n\nequipment (e.g. endotracheal tube and ventilator) have to be readily available.  \n\n \n\nThis radiopharmaceutical may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in \n\ndesignated clinical settings. Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations \n\nand the appropriate licences of the local competent official organisations. \n\n \n\nFor each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely benefit.  The \n\nactivity administered must be such that the resulting dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in \n\nmind the need to obtain the intended diagnostic result. \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nFormal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. In the \n\nabsence of data, DaTSCAN is not recommended in cases of moderate to severe renal or hepatic \n\nimpairment. \n\n \n\nThis medicinal product contains 39.5 g/l (5% volume) ethanol (alcohol), up to 197 mg per dose, \n\nequivalent to 5 ml beer or 2 ml wine. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be taken into \n\naccount in high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n\n \n\nNo interaction studies have been performed in humans. \n\n \n\nIoflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Medicines that bind to the dopamine transporter with high \n\naffinity may therefore interfere with DaTSCAN diagnosis. These include amfetamine, benzatropine, \n\nbuproprion, cocaine, mazindol, methylphenidate, phentermine and sertraline. \n\n \n\nMedicines shown during clinical trials not to interfere with DaTSCAN imaging include amantadine, \n\ntrihexyphenidyl, budipine, levodopa, metoprolol, primidone, propranolol and selegiline. Dopamine \n\nagonists and antagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expected to interfere \n\nwith DaTSCAN imaging and can therefore be continued if desired. Medicinal products shown in animal \n\nstudies not to interfere with DaTSCAN imaging include pergolide. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n\n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWhere it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of childbearing potential, \n\ninformation should always be sought about pregnancy. Any woman who has missed a period should be \n\nassumed pregnant until proven otherwise. Where uncertainty exists, it is important that radiation \n\nexposure should be the minimum consistent with achieving satisfactory imaging. Alternative techniques \n\nwhich do not involve ionising radiation should be considered. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nAnimal reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with this product. Radionuclide \n\nprocedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus. Administration of \n\n185 MBq of ioflupane (123I) results in an absorbed dose to the uterus of 3.0 mGy. DaTSCAN is \n\ncontraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nBreastfeeding \n\nIt is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is excreted in human milk.  Before administering a radioactive \n\nmedicinal product to a breast-feeding mother, consideration should be given as to whether the \n\ninvestigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breast-feeding and as to whether \n\nthe most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceutical has been made, bearing in mind the secretion of \n\nradioactivity in breast milk. If administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be \n\ninterrupted for 3 days and substituted by formula feeding. During this time, breast milk should be \n\nexpressed at regular intervals and the expressed feeds should be discarded. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo fertility studies have been performed. No data are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\n\n\n 5 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nThe following undesirable effects are recognised for DaTSCAN: \n\n \n\nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n\nThe frequencies of adverse reactions are defined as follows: \n\nVery common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥\n1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available \n\ndata).  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing \n\nseriousness.   \n\n \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nNot known: Hypersensitivity  \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nUncommon: Appetite increased \n\n \n\nNervous system disorders \n\nCommon: Headache \n\nUncommon: Dizziness, formication (paraesthesia), dysgeusia \n\n \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \n\nUncommon: Vertigo \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nNot known: Erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria, hyperhidrosis \n\n \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n\nNot known: Dyspnea \n\n \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nUncommon: Nausea, dry mouth \n\nNot known: Vomiting \n\n \n\nVascular disorders \n\nNot known: Blood pressure decreased \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nUncommon: Injection site pain (intense pain or burning sensation following administration into small \n\nveins)  \n\nNot known: Feeling hot \n\n \n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \n\nhereditary defects.  As the effective dose is 4.63 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of  \n\n185 MBq is administered these adverse events are expected to occur with a low probability. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n\n \n\nIn cases of overdose of radioactivity, frequent micturition and defaecation should be encouraged in \n\norder to minimise radiation dose to the patient. Care should be taken to avoid contamination from the \n\nradioactivity eliminated by the patient using such methods. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceutical central nervous system,  \n\nATC code: V09AB03. \n\n \n\nDue to the low quantities of ioflupane injected, pharmacological effects are not expected following \n\nintravenous administration of DaTSCAN at the recommended dosage. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nIoflupane is a cocaine analogue. Studies in animals have shown that ioflupane binds with high affinity to \n\nthe presynaptic dopamine transporter and so radiolabelled ioflupane (123I) can be used as a surrogate \n\nmarker to examine the integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Ioflupane also binds to the \n\nserotonin transporter on 5-HT neurons but with lower (approximately 10-fold) binding affinity. \n\n \n\nThere is no experience in types of tremor other than essential tremor. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\nClinical studies in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies \n\n \n\nIn a pivotal clinical trial including evaluation of 288 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) \n\n(144 subjects), Alzheimer’s disease (124 subjects), vascular dementia (9 subjects) or other (11 subjects), \n\nthe results of an independent, blinded visual assessment of the DaTSCAN images were compared to the \n\nclinical diagnosis as determined by physicians experienced in the management and diagnosis of \n\ndementias.  Clinical categorisation into the respective dementia group was based on a standardised and \n\ncomprehensive clinical and neuropsychiatric evaluation.  The values for the sensitivity of DaTSCAN in \n\ndetermining probable DLB from non-DLB ranged from 75.0% to 80.2% and specificity from 88.6% to \n\n91.4%.  The positive predictive value ranged from 78.9% to 84.4% and the negative predictive value \n\nfrom 86.1% to 88.7%. Analyses in which both possible and probable DLB patients were compared with \n\nnon-DLB dementia patients demonstrated values for the sensitivity of DaTSCAN ranging from 75.0% \n\nto 80.2% and specificity from 81.3% to 83.9% when the possible DLB patients were included as \n\nnon-DLB patients. The sensitivity ranged from 60.6% to 63.4% and specificity from 88.6% to 91.4% \n\nwhen the possible DLB patients were included as DLB patients. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\nIoflupane (123I) is cleared rapidly from the blood after intravenous injection; only 5% of the \n\nadministered activity remains in whole blood at 5 minutes post-injection.  \n\n \n\nOrgan uptake \n\nUptake in the brain is rapid, reaching about 7% of injected activity at 10 minutes post-injection and \n\ndecreasing to 3% after 5 hours. About 30% of the whole brain activity is attributed to striatal uptake.  \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nAt 48 hours post-injection, approximately 60% of the injected radioactivity is excreted in the urine, with \n\nfaecal excretion calculated at approximately 14%. \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nNon-clinical data for ioflupane reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \n\nsafety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \n\n \n\nStudies on reproductive toxicity and to assess the carcinogenic potential of ioflupane have not been \n\nperformed. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN 74 MBq/ml solution for injection \n\nIoflupane (123I) \n\n \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \nprocedure. \n\n If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What DaTSCAN is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before DaTSCAN is used \n3. How DaTSCAN is used \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How DaTSCAN is stored \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n\n \n\n1. What DaTSCAN is and what it is used for  \n \n\nDaTSCAN contains the active substance ioflupane (123I) which is used to help identify (diagnose) \n\nconditions in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called “radiopharmaceuticals”, which contain \n\na small amount of radioactivity.  \n\n• When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a \n\nshort time.  \n\n• Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using \n\nspecial cameras.  \n\n• A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is \n\ninside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ \n\nis working. \n\n \n\nWhen DaTSCAN is injected into an adult, it is carried around the body in the blood. It collects in a small \n\narea of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in: \n\n• Parkinsonism (including Parkinson’s disease) and  \n\n• dementia with Lewy bodies.  \n\n \n\nA scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may \n\nfeel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\nWhen DaTSCAN is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than \n\nin some types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that \n\nthe clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed \n\nto these small amounts of radiation. \n\n \n\nThis medicine is used for diagnostic use only. It is used only to identify illness. \n\n\n\n 22 \n\n2. What you need to know before DaTSCAN is used \n\nDaTSCAN must not be used  \n\n• if you are allergic to ioflupane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n• if you are pregnant  \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using DaTSCAN if you have a moderate or severe problem \n\nwith your kidneys or liver.  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents  \n\nDaTSCAN is not recommended for children aged 0 to 18 years  \n\n \n\nOther medicines and DaTSCAN \n\nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  \n\nSome medicines or substances can affect the way that DaTSCAN works.  \n\nThese include: \n\n• buproprion (used to treat depression (sadness)) \n\n• benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson’s disease) \n\n• mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity)  \n\n• sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)) \n\n• methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness)) \n\n• phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity)  \n\n• amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); also a \n\ndrug of abuse) \n\n• cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a drug of abuse) \n\n \n\nSome medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking \n\nthem for a short time before you receive DaTSCAN.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nDo not use DaTSCAN if you are pregnant or think you may possibly be pregnant. This is because the \n\nchild may receive some of the radioactivity. Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you think you might be \n\npregnant.  Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity should be considered. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of DaTSCAN, or ask you to \n\nstop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is passed into breast milk.  \n\n• You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after DaTSCAN is given.  \n\n• Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any \n\nbreast milk you have expressed.  \n\n• You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your body.   \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nDaTSCAN has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN contains alcohol (ethanol) 5 % by volume. Each dose contains up to 197 mg alcohol. This is \n\nabout the same as 5 ml beer, or 2 ml wine. This is harmful for those suffering from alcoholism and needs \n\nto be taken into account in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children and high risk groups such as \n\npatients with liver disease or epilepsy. Tell your doctor if any of these apply to you.  \n\n3. How DaTSCAN is used \n\nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radioactivity. DaTSCAN will always be used \n\nin a hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who are trained and \n\nqualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of this medicine. \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nYour nuclear medicine doctor will decide the dose that is best for you.  \n\n \n\nBefore you receive DaTSCAN, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid \n\nthat contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that \n\nyou take the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. \n\n \n\nDaTSCAN is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. The recommended \n\nradioactivity given by injection is between 111 to 185 MBq (megabequerel or MBq is a unit used to \n\nmeasure radioactivity). A single injection is enough. The camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours \n\nafter the injection of DaTSCAN. \n \n\nIf you are given more DaTSCAN than you should \n\nSince DaTSCAN is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an \n\noverdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get \n\nrid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell \n\nyou what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like DaTSCAN. Any ioflupane (123I) which \n\nremains in your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who \n\nsupervises the procedure.  \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, DaTSCAN can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n\nThe frequency of side effects is: \n\n \n\nCommon:  may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n\n-  Headache \n\n \n\nUncommon:  may affect up to 1 in 100 people \n\n-  Increased appetite \n\n-  Dizziness \n\n-  Taste disturbance \n\n-  Nausea \n\n-  Dry mouth \n\n-  Vertigo \n\n-  A brief irritating feeling similar to ants crawling over your skin (formication) \n\n-  Intense pain (or burning sensation) at the injection site. This has been reported among   \n\n    patients receiving DaTSCAN into a small vein.  \n\n \n\nNot known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. \n\n -  Hypersensitivity (allergic) \n\n-  Shortness of breath   \n\n-  Redness of the skin   \n\n-  Itching   \n\n-  Rash \n\n-  Hives (urticaria) \n\n-  Excessive sweating   \n\n-  Vomiting \n\n-  Low blood pressure   \n\n-  Feeling hot \n\n \n\nThe amount of radioactivity in the body from DaTSCAN is very small. It will be passed out of the body \n\nin a few days without need for you to take special precautions.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects \n\nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed \n\nin Appendix V.  By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \n\nmedicine.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. How DaTSCAN is stored \n \n\nYou will not have to store this medicine. This medicine is stored under the responsibility of the specialist \n\nin appropriate premises.
