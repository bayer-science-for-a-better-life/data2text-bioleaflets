This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nVemlidy 25 mg film-coated tablets. \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach film-coated tablet contains tenofovir alafenamide fumarate equivalent to 25 mg of tenofovir \nalafenamide. \n \nExcipient with known effect \n \nEach tablet contains 95 mg lactose (as monohydrate). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nFilm-coated tablet. \n \nYellow, round, film-coated tablets, 8 mm in diameter, debossed with \u201cGSI\u201d on one side of the tablet \nand \u201c25\u201d on the other side of the tablet. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nVemlidy is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years \nand older with body weight at least 35 kg) (see section 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg): one tablet once \ndaily. \n \nTreatment discontinuation \nTreatment discontinuation may be considered as follows (see section 4.4): \n \n\u2022 In HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least \n\n6-12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with \nanti-HBe detection) is confirmed or until HBs seroconversion or until there is loss of efficacy \n(see section 4.4).  Regular reassessment is recommended after treatment discontinuation to \ndetect virological relapse. \n\n \n\u2022 In HBeAg-negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until \n\nHBs seroconversion or until there is evidence of loss of efficacy.  With prolonged treatment for \n\n\n\n3 \n\nmore than 2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected \ntherapy remains appropriate for the patient. \n\n \nMissed dose \nIf a dose is missed and less than 18 hours have passed from the time it is usually taken, the patient \nshould take Vemlidy as soon as possible and then resume their normal dosing schedule.  If more than \n18 hours have passed from the time it is usually taken, the patient should not take the missed dose and \nshould simply resume the normal dosing schedule.  \n \nIf the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Vemlidy, the patient should take another tablet.  If the \npatient vomits more than 1 hour after taking Vemlidy, the patient does not need to take another tablet. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment of Vemlidy is required in patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vemlidy is required in adults or adolescents (aged at least 12 years and of at \nleast 35 kg body weight) with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \u2265 15 mL/min or in patients with \nCrCl < 15 mL/min who are receiving haemodialysis. \n \nOn days of haemodialysis, Vemlidy should be administered after completion of haemodialysis \ntreatment (see section 5.2). \n \nNo dosing recommendations can be given for patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis (see section 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of Vemlidy is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Vemlidy in children younger than 12 years of age, or weighing < 35 kg, \nhave not yet been established.  No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral administration.  Vemlidy film-coated tablets should be taken with food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHBV transmission \n \nPatients must be advised that Vemlidy does not prevent the risk of transmission of HBV to others \nthrough sexual contact or contamination with blood.  Appropriate precautions must continue to be \nused. \n \nPatients with decompensated liver disease \n \nThere are no data on the safety and efficacy of Vemlidy in HBV infected patients with decompensated \nliver disease and who have a Child Pugh Turcotte (CPT) score > 9 (i.e. class C).  These patients may \n\n\n\n4 \n\nbe at higher risk of experiencing serious hepatic or renal adverse reactions. Therefore, hepatobiliary \nand renal parameters should be closely monitored in this patient population (see section 5.2). \n \nExacerbation of hepatitis \n \nFlares on treatment  \nSpontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are characterised by \ntransient increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  After initiating antiviral therapy, \nserum ALT may increase in some patients.  In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases \nin serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or \nhepatic decompensation.  Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation \nfollowing hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. \n \nFlares after treatment discontinuation \nAcute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients who have discontinued treatment for \nhepatitis B, usually in association with rising HBV DNA levels in plasma.  The majority of cases are \nself-limited but severe exacerbations, including fatal outcomes, may occur after discontinuation of \ntreatment for hepatitis B.  Hepatic function should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical \nand laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after discontinuation of treatment for hepatitis B.  If \nappropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. \n \nIn patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended \nsince post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation.  Liver flares are \nespecially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. \n \nRenal impairment \n \nPatients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min \nThe use of Vemlidy once daily in patients with CrCl \u2265 15 mL/min but < 30 mL/min and in patients \nwith CrCl < 15 mL/min who are receiving haemodialysis is based on very limited pharmacokinetic \ndata and on modelling and simulation.  There are no safety data on the use of Vemlidy to treat \nHBV infected patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min. \n \nThe use of Vemlidy is not recommended in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min who are not receiving \nhaemodialysis (see section 4.2). \n \nNephrotoxicity \n \nA potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to \ndosing with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \n \nPatients co-infected with HBV and hepatitis C or D virus \n \nThere are no data on the safety and efficacy of Vemlidy in patients co-infected with hepatitis C or D \nvirus.  Co-administration guidance for the treatment of hepatitis C should be followed (see \nsection 4.5). \n \nHepatitis B and HIV co-infection \n \nHIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients whose HIV-1 infection status is \nunknown before initiating therapy with Vemlidy.  In patients who are co-infected with HBV and HIV, \nVemlidy should be co-administered with other antiretroviral agents to ensure that the patient receives \nan appropriate regimen for treatment of HIV (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nCo-administration with other medicinal products \n \nVemlidy should not be co-administered with medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide, \ntenofovir disoproxil or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nCo-administration of Vemlidy with certain anticonvulsants (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, \nphenobarbital and phenytoin), antimycobacterials (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin and rifapentine) or \nSt. John\u2019s wort, all of which are inducers of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and may decrease tenofovir \nalafenamide plasma concentrations, is not recommended. \n \nCo-administration of Vemlidy with strong inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. itraconazole and ketoconazole) may \nincrease tenofovir alafenamide plasma concentrations.  Co-administration is not recommended. \n \nLactose intolerance \n \nVemlidy contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal \nproduct. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nVemlidy should not be co-administered with medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil, \ntenofovir alafenamide or adefovir dipivoxil. \n \nMedicinal products that may affect tenofovir alafenamide \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).  Medicinal \nproducts that are P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or \nSt. John\u2019s wort) are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide, which may \nlead to loss of therapeutic effect of Vemlidy.  Co-administration of such medicinal products with \nVemlidy is not recommended. \n \nCo-administration of tenofovir alafenamide with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may \nincrease plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide.  Co-administration of strong inhibitors of \nP-gp with tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro.  The distribution of \ntenofovir alafenamide in the body may be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3. \n \nEffect of tenofovir alafenamide on other medicinal products \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6 in vitro.  It is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase \n(UGT) 1A1 in vitro.  It is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is an inhibitor of other \nUGT enzymes. \n \nDrug interaction information for Vemlidy with potential concomitant medicinal products is \nsummarised in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d; twice \n\n\n\n6 \n\ndaily as \u201cb.i.d.\u201d, single dose as \u201cs.d.\u201d, once daily as \u201cq.d.\u201d; and intravenously as \u201cIV\u201d).  The drug \ninteractions described are based on studies conducted with tenofovir alafenamide, or are potential drug \ninteractions that may occur with Vemlidy. \n \nTable 1: Interactions between

outcomes) from the use of tenofovir \nalafenamide in pregnant women.  However, a large amount of data on pregnant women (more than \n\n\n\n11 \n\n1,000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity associated with the use \nof tenofovir disoproxil. \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity \n(see section 5.3). \n \nThe use of tenofovir alafenamide may be considered during pregnancy, if necessary. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is secreted in human milk.  However, in animal studies \nit has been shown that tenofovir is secreted into milk.  There is insufficient information on the effects \nof tenofovir in newborns/infants. \n \nA risk to the breast-fed newborns/infants cannot be excluded; therefore, tenofovir alafenamide should \nnot be used during breast-feeding. \n \nFertility \n \nNo human data on the effect of tenofovir alafenamide on fertility are available.  Animal studies do not \nindicate harmful effects of tenofovir alafenamide on fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nVemlidy has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Patients should be \ninformed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir alafenamide. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on pooled safety data from 2 controlled Phase 3 studies \n(GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110; \u201cStudy 108\u201d and \u201cStudy 110\u201d, respectively) in which \n866 HBV infected viremic patients with elevated serum ALT levels received 25 mg tenofovir \nalafenamide once daily in a double-blind fashion through Week 96 (median duration of blinded study \ndrug exposure of 104 weeks) and from post-marketing experience. The most frequently reported \nadverse reactions were headache (12%), nausea (6%), and fatigue (6%).  After Week 96, patients \neither remained on their original blinded treatment or received open-label tenofovir alafenamide. \nChanges in lipid laboratory tests were observed in Study 108 and Study 110.  No additional adverse \nreactions to tenofovir alafenamide were identified from Week 96 through Week 144 in the double-\nblind phase and in the subset of subjects receiving open-label tenofovir alafenamide treatment (see \nsection 5.1). \n \nIn an ongoing double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study (GS-US-320-4018; \u201cStudy 4018\u201d) in \nvirologically suppressed subjects who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to 25 mg tenofovir \nalafenamide (N=243), changes in lipid laboratory tests were observed. No additional adverse reactions \nto tenofovir alafenamide were identified through Week 48.  \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse drug reactions have been identified with tenofovir alafenamide in patients with \nchronic hepatitis B (Table 2).  The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and \nfrequency based on the Week 96 analysis.  Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10), \ncommon (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) or uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nTable 2: Adverse drug reactions identified with tenofovir alafenamide  \n \nSystem organ class \nFrequency Adverse reaction  \nNervous system disorders \nVery common Headache \nCommon Dizziness \nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence \nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon Increased ALT \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon Rash, pruritus \nUncommon Angioedema1, urticaria1  \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon Arthralgia \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \nCommon Fatigue  \n1 Adverse reaction identified through post-marketing surveillance for tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. \n \nChanges in lipid laboratory tests \nIn a pooled analysis of Studies 108 and 110, median changes in fasting lipid parameters from baseline \nto Week 96 were observed in both treatment groups. In the tenofovir alafenamide group, decreases in \nmedian fasting total cholesterol and HDL, and increases in median fasting direct LDL and \ntriglycerides were observed, while the tenofovir disoproxil group demonstrated median reductions in \nall parameters (see Table 6). In patients randomised initially to tenofovir alafenamide and switched to \nreceive open-label tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96, the median (Q1, Q3) changes from double-blind \nbaseline to Week 144 were as follows (mg/dL): total cholesterol was 0 (-16, 18); LDL was 8 (-6, 24); \nHDL was -5 (-12, 2); triglycerides were 11 (-11, 40); total cholesterol to HDL ratio was 0.3 (0.0, 0.7). \nIn patients randomised initially to tenofovir disoproxil and switched to open-label tenofovir \nalafenamide at Week 96, the median (Q1, Q3) changes from double-blind baseline to Week 144 were \nas follows (mg/dL): total cholesterol was 1 (-17, 20); LDL was 9 (-5, 26); HDL was -8 (-15, -1); \ntriglycerides were 14 (-10, 43); total cholesterol to HDL ratio was 0.4 (0.0, 1.0). \n \nIn the open-label phase of Studies 108 and 110, where patients switched to open-label tenofovir \nalafenamide at Week 96, lipid parameters at Week 144 in patients who remained on tenofovir \nalafenamide were similar to those at Week 96, whereas median increases in fasting total cholesterol, \ndirect LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were observed in patients who switched from tenofovir disoproxil \nto tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96. In the open label phase, median (Q1, Q3) change from Week 96 \nto Week 144 in total cholesterol to HDL ratio was 0.0 (-0.2, 0.4) in patients who remained on \ntenofovir alafenamide and 0.2 (-0.2, 0.6) in patients who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to \ntenofovir alafenamide at Week 96.  \n \nIn Study 4018, median changes in fasting lipid parameters from baseline to Week 48 were observed in \nboth treatment groups. In the group that switched from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide, \nincreases in median fasting total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were observed, while the \ngroup continuing treatment with tenofovir disoproxil  demonstrated reductions in median fasting total \ncholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides, and a minimal median increase in LDL (p < 0.001 for the \ndifference between treatment groups in all parameters). Median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at \nWeek 48 in total cholesterol to HDL ratio was 0.2 (-0.1, 0.5) in the tenofovir alafenamide group and \n0.0 (-0.3, 0.3) in the tenofovir disoproxil group (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment \ngroups). \n \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nMetabolic parameters \nBody weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during therapy. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nIf overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8). \n \nTreatment of overdose with tenofovir alafenamide consists of general supportive measures including \nmonitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. \n \nTenofovir is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of \napproximately 54%.  It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse \ntranscriptase inhibitors; ATC code: J05AF13. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTenofovir alafenamide is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (2\u2019-deoxyadenosine \nmonophosphate analogue).  Tenofovir alafenamide enters primary hepatocytes by passive diffusion \nand by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Tenofovir alafenamide is primarily \nhydrolysed to form tenofovir by carboxylesterase 1 in primary hepatocytes.  Intracellular tenofovir is \nsubsequently phosphorylated to the pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  \nTenofovir diphosphate inhibits HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the \nHBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain termination. \n \nTenofovir has activity that is specific to hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 \nand HIV-2).  Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 and there is no evidence of mitochondrial toxicity in vitro based on \nseveral assays including mitochondrial DNA analyses. \n \nAntiviral activity \n \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide was assessed in HepG2 cells against a panel of \nHBV clinical isolates representing genotypes A-H.  The EC50 (50% effective concentration) values for \ntenofovir alafenamide ranged from 34.7 to 134.4 nM, with an overall mean EC50 of 86.6 nM.  \nThe CC50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) in HepG2 cells was > 44,400 nM. \n \nResistance \n \nIn patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide, sequence analysis was performed on paired baseline and \non-treatment HBV isolates for patients who either experienced virologic breakthrough (2 consecutive \nvisits with HBV DNA \u2265 69 IU/mL after having been < 69 IU/mL, or 1.0 log10 or greater increase in \nHBV DNA from nadir) or patients with HBV DNA \u2265 69 IU/mL at Week 48, or Week 96 or at early \ndiscontinuation at or after Week 24.   \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\n \nIn a pooled analysis of patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide in Study 108 and Study 110 at \nWeek 48 (N = 20) and Week 96 (N = 72), no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to \ntenofovir alafenamide were identified in these isolates (genotypic and phenotypic analyses). \n \nIn virologically suppressed patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide following switch from tenofovir \ndisoproxil  treatment in Study 4018, no patient experienced a virologic blip (one visit with HBV \nDNA \u2265 69 IU/mL), virologic breakthrough or persistent viremia during treatment, and 0 of 243 (0.0%) \npatients qualified for resistance analysis through 48 weeks of tenofovir alafenamide treatment. \n \nCross-resistance \nThe antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated against a panel of isolates containing \nnucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations in HepG2 cells.  HBV isolates expressing the \nrtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204V/I substitutions associated with resistance to lamivudine remained \nsusceptible to tenofovir alafenamide (< 2-fold change in EC50).  HBV isolates expressing the rtL180M, \nrtM204V plus rtT184G, rtS202G, or rtM250V substitutions associated with resistance to entecavir \nremained susceptible to tenofovir alafenamide.  HBV isolates expressing the rtA181T, rtA181V, or \nrtN236T single substitutions associated with resistance to adefovir remained susceptible to tenofovir \nalafenamide; however, the HBV isolate expressing rtA181V plus rtN236T exhibited reduced \nsusceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide (3.7-fold change in EC50).  The clinical relevance of these \nsubstitutions is not known. \n \nClinical data \n \nThe efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in patients with chronic hepatitis B are based on \n48- and 96-week data from two randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies, Study 108 and \nStudy 110.  The safety of tenofovir alafenamide is also supported by pooled data from patients in \nStudies 108 and 110 who remained on blinded treatment from Week 96 through Week 144 and \nadditionally from patients in the open-label phase of Studies 108 and 110 from Week 96 through \nWeek 144 (N = 360 remained on tenofovir alafenamide; N = 180 switched from tenofovir disoproxil \nto tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96). \n \nIn Study 108, HBeAg-negative treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with compensated \nliver function were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg; N = 285) once \ndaily or tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg; N = 140) once daily.  The mean age was 46 years, 61% were \nmale, 72% were Asian, 25% were White and 2% (8 subjects) were Black. 24%, 38%, and 31% had \nHBV genotype B, C, and D, respectively.  21% were treatment-experienced (previous treatment with \noral antivirals, including entecavir (N = 41), lamivudine (N = 42), tenofovir disoproxil (N = 21), or \nother (N = 18)).  At baseline, mean plasma HBV DNA was 5.8 log10 IU/mL, mean serum ALT was \n94 U/L, and 9% of patients had a history of cirrhosis. \n \nIn Study 110, HBeAg-positive treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients with compensated \nliver function were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg; N = 581) once \ndaily or tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg; N = 292) once daily.  The mean age was 38 years, 64% were \nmale, 82% were Asian, 17% were White and < 1% (5 subjects) were Black.  17%, 52%, and 23% had \nHBV genotype B, C, and D, respectively.  26% were treatment-experienced (previous treatment with \noral antivirals, including adefovir (N = 42), entecavir (N = 117), lamivudine (N = 84), telbivudine \n(N = 25), tenofovir disoproxil (N = 70), or other (N = 17)).  At baseline, mean plasma HBV DNA was \n7.6 log10 IU/mL, mean serum ALT was 120 U/L, and 7% of patients had a history of cirrhosis. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the proportion of patients with plasma HBV DNA \nlevels below 29 IU/mL at Week 48.  Tenofovir alafenamide met the non-inferiority criteria in \nachieving HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL when compared to tenofovir disoproxil.

Patients were stratified by HBeAg \nstatus (HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative) and age (\u2265 50 or < 50 years) and randomized in a 1:1 \nratio to switch to 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide (N=243) or remain on 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil \nonce daily (N=245). Mean age was 51 years (22% were \u2265 60 years), 71% were male, 82% were Asian, \n14% were White, and 68% were HBeAg-negative. At baseline, median duration of prior tenofovir \n\n\n\n18 \n\ndisoproxil treatment was 220 and 224 weeks in the tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir disoproxil \ngroups, respectively. Previous treatment with antivirals also included interferon (N=63), lamivudine \n(N=191), adefovir dipivoxil (N=185), entecavir (N=99), telbivudine (N=48), or other (N=23).  At \nbaseline, mean serum ALT was 27 U/L, median eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault was 90.5 mL/min; 16% of \npatients had a history of cirrhosis. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HBV DNA \nlevels \u2265 20 IU/mL at Week 48 (as determined by the modified US FDA Snapshot algorithm). \nAdditional efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients with HBV DNA levels < 20 IU/mL, \nALT normal and ALT normalization, HBsAg loss and seroconversion, and HBeAg loss and \nseroconversion. Tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior in the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA \n\u2265 20 IU/mL at Week 48 when compared to tenofovir disoproxil  as assessed by the modified US FDA \nSnapshot algorithm. Treatment outcomes (HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL by missing=failure) at Week 48 \nbetween treatment groups were similar across subgroups by age, sex, race, baseline HBeAg status, and \nALT. \n \nTreatment outcomes of Study 4018 at Week 48 are presented in Table 7 and Table 8. \n \nTable 7: HBV DNA efficacy parameters at Week 48a,b  \n \n\nTDF = tenofovir disoproxil  \nTAF = tenofovir alafenamide \na.

Based on Phase 3 population pharmacokinetic analysis in \nsubjects with chronic hepatitis B, mean steady state AUC0-24 for tenofovir alafenamide (N = 698) and \ntenofovir (N = 856) were 0.22 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL and 0.32 \u00b5g\u2022h/mL, respectively.  Steady state Cmax for \ntenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir were 0.18 and 0.02 \u00b5g/mL, respectively.  Relative to fasting \nconditions, the administration of a single dose of tenofovir alafenamide with a high fat meal resulted in \na 65% increase in tenofovir alafenamide exposure. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins in samples collected during clinical \nstudies was approximately 80%.  The binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is less than 0.7% \nand is independent of concentration over the range of 0.01-25 \u00b5g/mL. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nMetabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for \n> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to \ntenofovir (major metabolite) by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes; and by cathepsin A in peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is hydrolysed \nwithin cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite, \ntenofovir diphosphate. \n \nIn vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or \nCYP2D6.  Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nElimination \n \nRenal excretion of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with < 1% of the dose eliminated \nin urine.  Tenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir \nalafenamide and tenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively.  \nTenofovir is renally eliminated from the body by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active \ntubular secretion. \n \nLinearity/non-linearity \n \nTenofovir alafenamide exposures are dose proportional over the dose range of 8 to 125 mg. \n \nPharmacokinetics in special populations \n \nAge, gender and ethnicity \nNo clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics according to age or ethnicity have been \nidentified.  Differences in pharmacokinetics according to gender were not considered to be clinically \nrelevant. \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, total plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide and \ntenofovir are lower than those seen in subjects with normal hepatic function.  When corrected for \nprotein binding, unbound (free) plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide in severe hepatic \nimpairment and normal hepatic function are similar. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were \nobserved between healthy subjects and patients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl > 15 but \n< 30 mL/min) in studies of tenofovir alafenamide. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir were evaluated in HIV-1 infected, \ntreatment-na\u00efve adolescents who received tenofovir alafenamide (10 mg) given with elvitegravir, \ncobicistat and emtricitabine as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF; Genvoya).  No clinically \nrelevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were observed between \nadolescent and adult HIV-1 infected subjects.  \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical studies in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary target organs of toxicity.  \nBone toxicity was observed as reduced BMD in rats and dogs at tenofovir exposures at least four times \ngreater than those expected after administration of tenofovir alafenamide.  A minimal infiltration of \nhistiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir exposures of \napproximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after administration of \ntenofovir alafenamide. \n \nTenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxic assays. \n \nBecause there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after tenofovir alafenamide \nadministration compared to tenofovir disoproxil, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-postnatal study \nwere conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil.  No special hazard for humans was revealed in \nconventional studies of carcinogenic potential with tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) and toxicity to \nreproduction and development with tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) or tenofovir alafenamide.  \nReproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or \nfoetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a \nperi-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.  A long-term oral carcinogenicity study in mice \nshowed a low incidence of duodenal tumours, considered likely related to high local concentrations in \n\n\n\n22 \n\nthe gastrointestinal tract at the high dose of 600 mg/kg/day.  The mechanism of tumour formation in \nmice and potential relevance for humans is uncertain. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you take Vemlidy \n3. How to take Vemlidy \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Vemlidy \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Vemlidy is and what it is used for \n \nVemlidy contains the active substance tenofovir alafenamide.  This is an antiviral medicine, known as \na nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). \n \nVemlidy is used to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis B in adults and adolescents 12 years of age \nand older, who weigh at least 35 kg.  Hepatitis B is an infection affecting the liver, caused by the \nhepatitis B virus.  In patients with hepatitis B, Vemlidy controls the infection by stopping the virus \nfrom multiplying. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Vemlidy \n \nDo not take Vemlidy \n \n\u2022 if you are allergic to tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine \n\n(listed in section 6). \n \n\uf0e0 If this applies to you, do not take Vemlidy and tell your doctor immediately. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \n\u2022 Take care not to pass on your hepatitis B to other people.  You can still infect others when \n\ntaking this medicine.  Vemlidy does not reduce the risk of passing on hepatitis B to others \nthrough sexual contact or blood contamination.  You must continue to take precautions to avoid \nthis.  Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting others.   \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor if you have a history of liver disease.  Patients with liver disease, who are \n\ntreated for hepatitis B with antiviral medicines, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal \n\n\n\n32 \n\nliver complications.  Your doctor may need to carry out blood tests to monitor your liver \nfunction. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown \n\nproblems with your kidneys.  Before starting treatment and during treatment, your doctor may \norder blood tests to monitor how your kidneys work. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you also have hepatitis C or D.  Vemlidy has not been tested on \n\npatients who have hepatitis C or D as well as hepatitis B. \n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you also have HIV.  If you are not sure whether you have HIV, your \n\ndoctor should offer you HIV testing before you start taking Vemlidy for hepatitis B. \n \n\uf0e0 If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Vemlidy. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nDo not give this medicine to children who are under 12 years old or weigh less than 35 kg.  \nVemlidy has not been tested in children aged less than 12 years old or weighing less than 35 kg. \n \nOther medicines and Vemlidy \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  Vemlidy may interact with other medicines.  As a result, the amounts of Vemlidy or other \nmedicines in your blood may change.  This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may \nmake any side effects worse. \n \nMedicines used in treating hepatitis B infection \nDo not take Vemlidy with other medicines containing: \n\u2022 tenofovir alafenamide \n\u2022 tenofovir disoproxil  \n\u2022 adefovir dipivoxil \n \nOther types of medicines \nTalk to your doctor if you are taking: \n\u2022 antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections including tuberculosis, containing: \n\n- rifabutin, rifampicin or rifapentine \n\u2022 antiviral medicines used to treat HIV, such as: \n\n- ritonavir or cobicistat boosted darunavir, lopinavir or atazanavir \n\u2022 anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy, such as: \n\n- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin \n\u2022 herbal remedies used to treat depression and anxiety, containing: \n\n- St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) \n\u2022 antifungal medicines used to treat fungal infections, containing: \n\n- ketoconazole or itraconazole \n \n\uf0e0 Tell your doctor if you are taking these or any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant. \n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\u2022 Do not breast-feed during treatment with Vemlidy.  It is recommended that you do not \nbreast-feed to avoid passing tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir to the baby through breast milk. \n\n \nDriving and using machines \n \nVemlidy can cause dizziness.  If you feel dizzy when taking Vemlidy, do not drive and do not use any \ntools or machines. \n \nVemlidy contains lactose \n \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nVemlidy contains sodium \n \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to take Vemlidy \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or \npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended dose is one tablet once a day with food.  Treatment should continue for as long as \nyour doctor tells you.  Usually this is for at least 6 to 12 months and may be for many years. \n \nIf you take more Vemlidy than you should \n \nIf you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Vemlidy you may be at increased risk of \nexperiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). \n \nContact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep the tablet bottle \nwith you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. \n \nIf you forget to take Vemlidy \n \nIt is important not to miss a dose of Vemlidy.  If you do miss a dose, work out how long since you \nshould have taken it. \n \n\u2022 If it is less than 18 hours after you usually take Vemlidy, take it as soon as you can, and then \n\ntake your next dose at its regular time. \n \n\u2022 If it is more than 18 hours after you usually take Vemlidy, then do not take the missed dose.  \n\nWait and take the next dose at the regular time.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a \nforgotten tablet. \n\n \nIf you are sick (vomit) less than 1 hour after taking Vemlidy, take another tablet.  You do not need \nto take another tablet if you are sick (vomit) more than 1 hour after taking Vemlidy. \n \nIf you stop taking Vemlidy \n \nDo not stop taking Vemlidy without your doctor\u2019s advice.  Stopping treatment with Vemlidy may \ncause your hepatitis B to get worse.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, this \ncould be life-threatening.  If you stop taking Vemlidy, you will need regular health checks and blood \ntests for several months to check your hepatitis B infection. \n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n\u2022 Talk to your doctor before you stop taking Vemlidy for any reason, particularly if you are \nexperiencing any side effects or you have another illness. \n\n \n\u2022 Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, \n\nparticularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. \n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor before you restart taking Vemlidy tablets. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4.

accidentally take more than the recommended dose of vemlidy you may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, possible side effects). contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. keep the tablet bottle with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. if you forget to take vemlidy it is important not to miss a dose of vemlidy. if you do miss a dose, work out how long since you should have taken it. if it is less than 18 hours after you usually take vemlidy, take it as soon as you can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. if it is more than 18 hours after you usually take vemlidy, then do not take the missed dose. wait and take the next dose at the regular time. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. if you are sick (vomit) less than 1 hour after taking vemlidy, take another tablet. you do not need to take another tablet if you are sick (vomit) more than 1 hour after taking vemlidy. if you stop taking vemlidy do not stop taking vemlidy without your doctor's advice. stopping treatment with vemlidy may cause your hepatitis b to get worse. in some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, this could be life-threatening. if you stop taking vemlidy, you will need regular health checks and blood tests for several months to check your hepatitis b infection. talk to your doctor before you stop taking vemlidy for any reason, particularly if you are experiencing any side effects or you have another illness. tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis b infection. talk to your doctor before you restart taking vemlidy tablets. if you have any further
