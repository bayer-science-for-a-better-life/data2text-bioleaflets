PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder for concentrate for solution for infusion. \n \nWhite to pale yellow lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nZercepac is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \n(MBC): \n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy \n\nregimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an \nanthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor \npositive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these \ntreatments. \n\n \n- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. \n \n- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received \n\nchemotherapy for their metastatic disease. \n \n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with \n\nhormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nEarly breast cancer \n \nZercepac is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). \n \n- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see \n\nsection 5.1). \n \n- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with \n\npaclitaxel or docetaxel. \n \n- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. \n \n- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Zercepac therapy, for \n\nlocally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see \nsections 4.4 and 5.1). \n\n \nZercepac should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have \neither HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated \nassay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nZercepac in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment \nof adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal \njunction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. \n \nZercepac should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have \nHER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC 3+ \nresult. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Zercepac treatment \nshould only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy \n(see section 4.4) and should be administered by a healthcare professional only.  \n \nZercepac intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be \nadministered via an intravenous infusion only. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the \nmedicinal product being prepared and administered is Zercepac (trastuzumab) and not Kadcyla \n(trastuzumab emtansine). \n \nPosology \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \n \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nWeekly schedule \n \nThe recommended initial loading dose of Zercepac is 4 mg/kg body weight. The recommended weekly \nmaintenance dose of Zercepac is 2 mg/kg body weight, beginning one week after the loading dose. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n \nAdministration in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel \n \nIn the pivotal trials (H0648g, M77001), paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following the \nfirst dose of trastuzumab (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for paclitaxel \nor docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of trastuzumab if the preceding dose of \ntrastuzumab was well tolerated. \n \nAdministration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor \n \nIn the pivotal trial (BO16216) trastuzumab and anastrozole were administered from day 1. There were \nno restrictions on the relative timing of trastuzumab and anastrozole at administration (for dose, see \nthe SmPC for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors). \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly and weekly schedule \n \nAs a three-weekly regimen the recommended initial loading dose of Zercepac is 8 mg/kg body weight. \nThe recommended maintenance dose of Zercepac at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, \nbeginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nAs a weekly regimen (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg every week) concomitantly \nwith paclitaxel following chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nSee section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \n \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose \nat three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nBreast cancer and gastric cancer \n \nDuration of treatment \n \nPatients with MBC or MGC should be treated with Zercepac until progression of disease. \n \nPatients with EBC should be treated with Zercepac for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever \noccurs first; extending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n \nDose reduction \n \nNo reductions in the dose of Zercepac were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue therapy \nduring periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be monitored \ncarefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the SmPC for paclitaxel, \ndocetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays. \n \nIf left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops \u2265 10 points from baseline AND to below \n50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately \n3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart failure \n(CHF) has developed, discontinuation of Zercepac should be strongly considered, unless the benefits \nfor the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n \nMissed doses \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Zercepac by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose \n(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as \npossible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent maintenance doses should be \nadministered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, respectively. \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Zercepac by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Zercepac \nshould be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly regimen: 4 mg/kg; three-weekly \nregimen: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Zercepac maintenance doses (weekly regimen: \n2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen 6 mg/kg respectively) should be administered 7 days or 21 days later \naccording to the weekly or three-weekly schedules respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nDedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not \nbeen carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not shown \nto affect trastuzumab disposition. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThere is no relevant use of Zercepac in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nZercepac is for intravenous use only. The loading dose should be administered as a 90-minute \nintravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Zercepac intravenous \ninfusion should be administered by a healthcare provider prepared to manage anaphylaxis and an \nemergency kit should be available. Patients should be observed for at least six hours after the start of \nthe first infusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever \nand chills or other infusion-related symptoms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Interruption or slowing the \nrate of the infusion may help control such symptoms. The infusion may be resumed when symptoms \nabate. \n \nIf the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute \ninfusion. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Zercepac intravenous formulation before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring \n\nsupplementary oxygen therapy. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of \nthe testing procedures (see section 5.1). \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \nCurrently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous exposure \nto Zercepac in the adjuvant setting. \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nGeneral considerations \n \nPatients treated with Zercepac are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart Association \n[NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been observed in \npatients receiving trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, \nparticularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. These may \nbe moderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, caution \nshould be exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, documented \ncoronary artery disease, CHF, LVEF of <55%, older age. \n \nAll candidates for treatment with Zercepac, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop \ncardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months \nduring treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months from the \nlast administration of Zercepac. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding to \ntreat with Zercepac. \n \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping Zercepac treatment based \non population pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who receive \nanthracyclines after stopping Zercepac may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. If \npossible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping \nZercepac. If anthracyclines are used, the patient\u2019s cardiac function should be monitored carefully. \n \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent \nmonitoring (e.g. every 6 - 8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, \nbut remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of \nZercepac therapy has been seen. \n \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of Zercepac in patients who experience cardiac dysfunction \nhas not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops \u226510 points from baseline AND to \nbelow 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within \napproximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has \ndeveloped, discontinuation of Zercepac should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the \nindividual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Zercepac therapy, it should be treated with standard \nmedicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction \nin pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker. The majority of \npatients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of trastuzumab treatment continued \non therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nZercepac and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting. \n \nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac dysfunction \nwith Zercepac treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of Zercepac and \nanthracyclines. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every \n3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months \nfrom the last administration of Zercepac. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the last \nadministration of Zercepac, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \n \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II \u2013IV), LVEF of <55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with trastuzumab and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \n \nAdjuvant treatment \n \nZercepac and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the adjuvant \ntreatment setting. \n \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when trastuzumab was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy \ncompared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was \nmore marked when trastuzumab was administered concurrently with taxanes than when administered \nsequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred \nwithin the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow-up of \n5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic \ncardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently \nwith a taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37% compared to approximately 1% in the two \ncomparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin \nand trastuzumab). \n \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(>50 years), low LVEF (<55%) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel treatment, \ndecline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive medicinal products. \nIn patients receiving trastuzumab after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the risk of cardiac \ndysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given prior to initiation of \ntrastuzumab and a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. \n \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \n \nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, Zercepac should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin \n360 mg/m2. \n \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and Zercepac \nin the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after surgery. In \nother situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is determined based \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\non individual factors. \n \nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is \ncurrently limited to two trials (MO16432 and BO22227). \n \nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2). \n \nThe incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7% in the trastuzumab arm. \n \nIn the pivotal trial BO22227, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy that contained four cycles of epirubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2); at a median \nfollow-up exceeding 70 months, the incidence of congestive cardiac failure was 0.3% in the \ntrastuzumab intravenous arm. \n \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity \n \nSerious IRRs to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, \nbronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory \ndistress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication may be used to \nreduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during or within \n2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion should be \ndiscontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until resolution of all \nobserved symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an analgesic/antipyretic \nsuch as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. The majority of \npatients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of \ntrastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, \nbeta- agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course \nculminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of \nadvanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. \nTherefore, these patients should not be treated with Zercepac (see section 4.3). \n \nInitial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical \ndeterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week \nfollowing infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms \nand pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the trastuzumab infusion. Patients \nshould be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their \nphysician if these symptoms occur. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary events have been reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing setting \n(see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial lung \ndisease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, \npleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been \nreported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant therapy \nwith other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as taxanes, gemcitabine, \nvinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or \nwith a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced \nmalignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, these patients \nshould not be treated with Zercepac (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised for pneumonitis, \nespecially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between \nZercepac and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. \n \nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl- \npaclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg or \n4 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w IV, respectively). \n \nHowever, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 \ndihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of this \nmetabolite was unclear. \n \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg \nIV weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 IV) in Japanese women with HER2- positive MBC, suggested \nthat concomitant administration of trastuzumab had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of \ndocetaxel. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 (ToGA) performed in male and female \nJapanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and \ncisplatin when used with or without trastuzumab. The results of this substudy suggested that the \nexposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was not affected by concurrent use of \ncisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus trastuzumab. However, capecitabine itself showed \nhigher concentrations and a longer half-life when combined with trastuzumab. The data also suggested \nthat the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected by concurrent use of capecitabine or by \nconcurrent use of capecitabine plus trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of carboplatin. \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics \n \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy \n(4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w IV) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women with \nHER2- positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of \ndocetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \n \nComparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III study \n(H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab and paclitaxel and two \nPhase II studies in which trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982), in \nwomen with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum \nconcentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant \nadministration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK \ndata from Study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated concomitantly with \ntrastuzumab, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where trastuzumab was \nadministered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nor paclitaxel (Study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \n \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith Zercepac and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \n \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the \nweekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation and have revealed \nno evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab during the \nearly (days 20\u201350 of gestation) and late (days 120-150 of gestation) foetal development period was \nobserved. It is not known whether trastuzumab can affect reproductive capacity. As animal \nreproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, trastuzumab should be avoided \nduring pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, cases of foetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association \nwith oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, have been \nreported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. Women who become pregnant should be advised \nof the possibility of harm to the foetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with Zercepac, or if a patient \nbecomes pregnant while receiving Zercepac or within 7 months following the last dose of Zercepac, \nclose monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nA study conducted in lactating Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human \nmaintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation demonstrated that trastuzumab is \nsecreted in the milk. The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated \nwith any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. It is not known \nwhether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, and the \npotential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during Zercepac therapy \nand for 7 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \n \nThere is no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nZercepac has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \n \nPatients experiencing infusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and \nuse machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAmongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in trastuzumab usage to date are \ncardiac dysfunction, infusion-related reactions, haematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections \nand pulmonary adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (\u22651/10), common \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n(\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Specific percentages for these are not available. \n*  Observed with combination therapy following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nCongestive heart failure (NYHA Class II \u2013 IV) is a common adverse reaction associated with the use \nof trastuzumab and has been associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms of \ncardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 gallop, or \nreduced ventricular ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with trastuzumab (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn 3 pivotal clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab given in combination with chemotherapy, the \nincidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure) was \nsimilar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (i.e. did not receive trastuzumab) and \nin patients who were administered trastuzumab sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was \nhighest in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently with a taxane (2.0%). In the \nneoadjuvant setting, the experience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and low dose \nanthracycline regimen is limited (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen trastuzumab was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III-IV \nheart failure was observed in 0.6% of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of \n12 months. In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF \n(NYHA Class III & IV) in the trastuzumab 1 year treatment arm was 0.8%, and the rate of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6%. \n \nReversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values \u226550% \nafter the event) was evident for 71.4% of trastuzumab-treated patients. Reversibility of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5% of patients. \nApproximately 17% of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of trastuzumab. \n \nIn the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous trastuzumab, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction varied \nbetween 9% and 12% when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1%-4% for paclitaxel \nalone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6% \u2013 9%. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction was seen in \npatients receiving trastuzumab concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (27%), and was \nsignificantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7%-10%). In a subsequent trial \nwith prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic CHF was 2.2% in \npatients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with 0% in patients receiving docetaxel alone. \n \nMost of the patients (79%) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these trials experienced an \nimprovement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n \nInfusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity \n \nIt is estimated that approximately 40% of patients who are treated with trastuzumab will experience \nsome form of infusion-related reaction. However, the majority of infusion-related reactions are mild to \nmoderate in intensity (NCI-CTC grading system) and tend to occur earlier in treatment, i.e. during \ninfusions one, two and three and lessen in frequency in subsequent infusions. Reactions include chills, \nfever, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, \nrespiratory distress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache (see section 4.4). The rate of infusion-related \nreactions of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data collection \nmethodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as \nmonotherapy. \n \nSevere anaphylactic reactions requiring immediate additional intervention can occur usually during \neither the first or second infusion of trastuzumab (see section 4.4) and have been associated with a \nfatal outcome. \n \nAnaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. \n \nHaematotoxicity \n \nFebrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very \ncommonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinaemia is not known. The risk of \nneutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following \nanthracycline therapy. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of trastuzumab and have been \nassociated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute \npulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nDetails of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are \npresented in (section 4.4) Warnings and Precautions. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, \n10.1% (30/296) of patients treated with trastuzumab intravenous developed antibodies against \ntrastuzumab. Neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of \n30 patients in the trastuzumab intravenous arm. \n \nThe clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known. The presence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies \nhad no impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete Response [pCR] \nand event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of administration related reactions \n(ARRs) of trastuzumab intravenous. \n \nThere are no immunogenicity data available for trastuzumab in gastric cancer. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n16 \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. Single doses of Zercepac alone greater \nthan 10 mg/kg have not been administered in the clinical trials; a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg q3w \nfollowing a loading dose of 8 mg/kg has been studied in a clinical trial with metastatic gastric cancer \npatients. Doses up to this level were well tolerated. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC03 \n \nZercepac is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nTrastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of primary breast \ncancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) \nand fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) have shown \nthat there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 34.0% for IHC and 7.1% to \n42.6% for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a \nshortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress HER2. The \nextracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood stream and measured in \nserum samples. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nTrastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of \nHER2\u2019s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 \nsignalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism \nof HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit \nthe proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent \nmediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated \nADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared \nwith cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer \n \nZercepac should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene \namplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should be \ndetected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see \nsection 4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation \n(FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for \nZercepac treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or a \npositive FISH or CISH result. \n \nTo ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory, \nwhich can ensure validation of the testing procedures. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 2: \n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nTable 2 Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns in breast cancer \n \n\nScore Staining pattern HER2 overexpression assessment \n\n0 No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in <10% of the tumour cells \nNegative \n\n1+ \nA faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is \ndetected in >10% of the tumour cells. The cells are \nonly stained in part of their membrane. \n\nNegative \n\n2+ A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is detected in >10% of the tumour cells. \nEquivocal \n\n3+ Strong complete membrane staining is detected in >10% of the tumour cells. \nPositive \n\n \nIn general, FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour cell to \nthe chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2, or if there are more than 4 copies of the \nHER2 gene per tumour cell if no chromosome 17 control is used. \n \nIn general, CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus \nin greater than 50% of tumour cells. \n \nFor full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of \nvalidated FISH and CISH assays. Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. \n \nFor any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the \nanalyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance \nof validated methods. Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate \noverexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and \nstrong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 over expression or HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer \n \nOnly an accurate and validated assay should be used to detect HER2 over expression or HER2 gene \namplification. IHC is recommended as the first testing modality and in cases where HER2 gene \namplification status is also required, either a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) or a FISH \ntechnique must be applied. SISH technology is however, recommended to allow for the parallel \nevaluation of tumour histology and morphology. To ensure validation of testing procedures and the \ngeneration of accurate and reproducible results, HER2 testing must be performed in a laboratory \nstaffed by trained personnel. Full instructions on assay performance and results interpretation should \nbe taken from the product information leaflet provided with the HER2 testing assays used. \n \nIn the ToGA (BO18255) trial, patients whose tumours were either IHC3+ or FISH positive were \ndefined as HER2 positive and thus included in the trial. Based on the clinical trial results, the \nbeneficial effects were limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression, \ndefined by a 3+ score by IHC, or a 2+ score by IHC and a positive FISH result. \n \nIn a method comparison study (study D008548) a high degree of concordance (>95%) was observed \nfor SISH and FISH techniques for the detection of HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer patients. \n \nHER2 over expression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of \nfixed tumour blocks; HER2 gene amplification should be detected using in situ hybridisation using \neither SISH or FISH on fixed tumour blocks. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 3:  \n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nTable 3 Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns in gastric cancer \n \nScore Surgical specimen - staining \n\npattern \nBiopsy specimen \u2013 staining \npattern \n\nHER2 \noverexpression \nassessment \n\n0 \nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in <10% of tumour \ncells \n\nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in any tumour cell Negative \n\n1+ \n\nFaint \u2044 barely perceptible \nmembranous reactivity in \u226510% \nof tumour cells; cells are \nreactive only in part of their \nmembrane \n\nTumour cell cluster with a faint \u2044 \nbarely perceptible membranous \nreactivity irrespective of \npercentage of tumour cells stained \n\nNegative \n\n2+ \n\nWeak to moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity in \n\u226510% of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a weak \nto moderate complete, basolateral \nor lateral membranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nEquivocal \n\n3+ \n\nStrong complete, basolateral or \nlateral membranous reactivity \nin \u226510% of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a strong \ncomplete, basolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nPositive \n\n \nIn general, SISH or FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour \ncell to the chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nTrastuzumab has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have tumours \nthat overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic \ndisease (trastuzumab alone). \n \nTrastuzumab has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of \npatients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had previously \nreceived anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 infused \nover 3 hours) with or without trastuzumab. In the pivotal trial of docetaxel (100 mg/m2 infused over \n1 hour) with or without trastuzumab, 60% of the patients had received prior anthracycline-based \nadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with trastuzumab until progression of disease. \n \nThe efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior \nadjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied. However, trastuzumab plus docetaxel was efficacious in \npatients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. \n \nThe test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal \ntrastuzumab monotherapy and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed \nimmunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine \nmonoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin\u2019s fixative. This \ninvestigative clinical trial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. Patients \nclassified as staining 2+ or 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. Greater than \n70% of patients enrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial effects were \ngreater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). \n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nThe main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or \nwithout trastuzumab, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using fluorescence \nin-situ hybridisation (FISH). In this trial, 87% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+, and \n95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive. \n \nWeekly dosing in metastatic breast cancer \n \nThe efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies are summarised in \nTable 4: \n \nTable 4 Efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies \n \n\nParameter Monotherapy Combination therapy \n Trastuzumab1 \n\n \nN=172 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus paclitaxel2 \n\nN=68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n \n\nN=77 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus docetaxel3  \n\nN=92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \n \n\nN=94 \nResponse rate 18% \n\n(13 - 25) \n49% \n\n(36 - 61) \n17% \n\n(9 - 27) \n61% \n\n(50-71) \n34% \n\n(25-45) (95%CI) \nMedian duration \nof response \n(months) \n(95%CI) \n\n9.1 \n(5.6-10.3) \n\n8.3 \n(7.3-8.8) \n\n4.6 \n(3.7-7.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.3 \u2013 15.0) \n\n5.7 \n(4.6-7.6) \n\nMedian TTP \n(months) \n(95%CI) \n\n3.2 \n(2.6-3.5) \n\n7.1 \n(6.2-12.0) \n\n3.0 \n(2.0-4.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.2-13.5) \n\n6.1 \n(5.4-7.2) \n\nMedian Survival \n(months) \n(95%CI) \n\n16.4 \n(12.3-ne) \n\n24.8 \n(18.6-33.7) \n\n17.9 \n(11.2-23.8) \n\n31.2 \n(27.3-40.8) \n\n22.74 \n(19.1-30.8) \n\nTTP = time to progression; \u201cne\u201d indicates that it could not be estimated or it was not yet reached. \n1.

More patients treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel progressed in the central nervous \nsystem than those treated with paclitaxel alone (12.6% versus 6.5%; p=0.377). \n \nEarly breast cancer (adjuvant setting) \n \nEarly breast cancer is defined as non-metastatic primary invasive carcinoma of the breast. \n \nIn the adjuvant treatment setting, trastuzumab was investigated in 4 large multicentre, randomised, \ntrials. \n \n- Study BO16348 was designed to compare one and two years of three-weekly trastuzumab \n\ntreatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery, established \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). In addition, comparison of two years of \ntrastuzumab treatment versus one year of trastuzumab treatment was performed. Patients \nassigned to receive trastuzumab were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by \n6 mg/kg every three weeks for either one or two years. \n\n \n- The NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies that comprise the joint analysis were designed to \n\ninvestigate the clinical utility of combining trastuzumab treatment with paclitaxel following AC \nchemotherapy, additionally the NCCTG N9831 study also investigated adding trastuzumab \nsequentially to AC\u2192P chemotherapy in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n \n- The BCIRG 006 study was designed to investigate combining trastuzumab treatment with \n\ndocetaxel either following AC chemotherapy or in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin \nin patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n \nEarly breast cancer in the HERA trial was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma of \nthe breast, with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in diameter. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nIn the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, EBC was limited to women with \noperable breast cancer at high risk, defined as HER2-positive and axillary lymph node positive or \nHER2 positive and lymph node negative with high risk features (tumour size >1 cm and ER negative \nor tumour size >2 cm, regardless of hormonal status). \n \nIn the BCIRG 006 study HER2 positive, EBC was defined as either lymph node positive or high risk \nnode negative patients with no (pN0) lymph node involvement, and at least 1 of the following factors: \ntumour size greater than 2 cm, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative, histological \nand/or nuclear grade 2-3, or age <35 years. \n \nThe efficacy results from the BO16348 trial following 12 months* and 8 years** median follow-up \nare summarized in Table 6: \n \nTable 6 Efficacy results from study BO16348 \n \n Median follow-up \n\n12 months* \nMedian follow-up \n\n8 years** \nParameter Observation \n\nN=1693 \nTrastuzumab \n\n1 Year \nN = 1693 \n\nObservation \nN= 1697*** \n\nTrastuzumab \n1 Year \n\nN = 1702*** \nDisease-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 219 (12.9%) 127 (7.5%) 570 (33.6%) 471 (27.7%) \n- No. patients without event 1474 (87.1%) 1566 (92.5%) 1127 (66.4%) 1231 (72.3%) \nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.54 0.76 \nRecurrence-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 208 (12.3%) 113 (6.7%) 506 (29.8%) 399 (23.4%) \n- No. patients without event 1485 (87.7%) 1580 (93.3%) 1191 (70.2%) 1303 (76.6%) \nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.51 0.73 \nDistant disease-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 184 (10.9%) 99 (5.8%) 488 (28.8%) 399 (23.4%) \n- No. patients without event 1508 (89.1%) 1594 (94.6%) 1209 (71.2%) 1303 (76.6%) \nP-value versus Observation < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.50 0.76 \nOverall survival (death)     \n- No. patients with event 40 (2.4%) 31 (1.8%) 350 (20.6%) 278 (16.3%) \n- No. patients without event 1653 (97.6%) 1662 (98.2%) 1347 (79.4%) 1424 (83.7%) \nP-value versus Observation 0.24 0.0005 \nHazard Ratio versus Observation 0.75 0.76 \n*Co-primary endpoint of DFS of 1 year versus observation met the pre-defined statistical boundary \n**Final analysis (including crossover of 52% of patients from the observation arm to trastuzumab) \n*** There is a discrepancy in the overall sample size due to a small number of patients who were \nrandomized after the cut-off date for the 12-month median follow-up analysis \n \nThe efficacy results from the interim efficacy analysis crossed the protocol pre-specified statistical \nboundary for the comparison of 1-year of trastuzumab versus observation. After a median follow-up of \n12 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for disease free survival (DFS) was 0.54 (95% CI 0.44, 0.67) which \ntranslates into an absolute benefit, in terms of a 2-year disease-free survival rate, of 7.6 percentage \npoints (85.8% versus 78.2%) in favour of the trastuzumab arm. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nA final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 8 years, which showed that 1 year \ntrastuzumab treatment is associated with a 24% risk reduction compared to observation only \n(HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67, 0.86). This translates into an absolute benefit in terms of an 8 year disease \nfree survival rate of 6.4 percentage points in favour of 1 year trastuzumab treatment. \n \nIn this final analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show \nadditional benefit over treatment for 1 year [DFS HR in the intent to treat (ITT) population of 2 years \nversus 1 year=0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value=0.90 and OS HR=0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value=0.78]. \nThe rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year treatment arm (8.1% versus \n4.6% in the 1-year treatment arm). More patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event in \nthe 2-year treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the 1-year treatment arm (16.3%). \n \nIn the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies trastuzumab was administered in combination with \npaclitaxel, following AC chemotherapy. \n \n Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were administered concurrently as follows: \n \n\n- intravenous push doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2, given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. \n \n- intravenous cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, given every 3 weeks for \n\n4 cycles. \n \n Paclitaxel, in combination with trastuzumab, was administered as follows: \n \n\n- intravenous paclitaxel - 80 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every \nweek for 12 weeks. \n\n \nor \n \n\n- intravenous paclitaxel - 175 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every \n3 weeks for 4 cycles (day 1 of each cycle). \n\n \nThe efficacy results from the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG 9831 trials at the time of \nthe definitive analysis of DFS* are summarized in Table 7.

At the time of \nthe analysis a total of 349 randomized patients had died: 182 patients (62.8%) in the control arm and \n167 patients (56.8%) in the treatment arm. The majority of the deaths were due to events related to the \nunderlying cancer. \n \nPost-hoc subgroup analyses indicate that positive treatment effects are limited to targeting tumours \nwith higher levels of HER2 protein (IHC 2+/FISH+ or IHC 3+). The median overall survival for the \nhigh HER2 expressing group was 11.8 months versus 16 months, HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.83) and the \nmedian progression free survival was 5.5 months versus 7.6 months, HR 0.64 (95% CI 0.51-0.79) for \nFP versus FP + H, respectively.

A two-compartment model with parallel linear and non-linear elimination from the \ncentral compartment described the trastuzumab concentration-time profile. Due to non-linear \nelimination, total clearance increased with decreasing concentration. Therefore, no constant value for \nhalf-life of trastuzumab can be deduced. The t1/2 decreases with decreasing concentrations within a \ndosing interval (see Table 16). MBC and EBC patients had similar PK parameters (e.g. clearance \n(CL), the central compartment volume (Vc)) and population-predicted steady-state exposures (Cmin, \nCmax and AUC). Linear clearance was 0.136 L/day for MBC, 0.112 L/day for EBC and 0.176 L/day for \nAGC. The non-linear elimination parameter values were 8.81 mg/day for the maximum elimination \nrate (Vmax) and 8.92 mcg/mL for the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the MBC, EBC, and AGC \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\npatients. The central compartment volume was 2.62 L for patients with MBC and EBC and 3.63 L for \npatients with AGC. In the final population PK model, in addition to primary tumour type, \nbody-weight, serum aspartate aminotransferase and albumin were identified as a statistically \nsignificant covariates affecting the exposure of trastuzumab. However, the magnitude of effect of \nthese covariates on trastuzumab exposure suggests that these covariates are unlikely to have a \nclinically meaningful effect on trastuzumab concentrations. \n \nThe population predicted PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles) and PK parameter \nvalues at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax and Cmin) for MBC, EBC and AGC patients treated \nwith the approved q1w and q3w dosing regimens are shown in Table 14 (Cycle 1), Table 15 (steady- \nstate), and Table 16 (PK parameters). \n \nTable 14 Population predicted cycle 1 PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles) for \ntrastuzumab intravenous dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumour type N Cmin (mcg/mL) \nCmax \n\n(mcg/mL) \nAUC0-21days \n\n(mcg.day/mL) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg \nq3w \n\nMBC 805 28.7 (2.9 - 46.3) \n182 \n\n(134 - 280) \n1376 \n\n(728 - 1998) \n\nEBC 390 30.9 (18.7 - 45.5) \n176 \n\n(127 - 227) \n1390 \n\n(1039 - 1895) \n\nAGC 274 23.1 (6.1 - 50.3) \n132 \n\n(84.2 \u2013 225) \n1109 \n\n(588 \u2013 1938) \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 37.4 (8.7 - 58.9) \n76.5 \n\n(49.4 - 114) \n1073 \n\n(597 \u2013 1584) \n\nEBC 390 38.9 (25.3 - 58.8) \n76.0 \n\n(54.7 - 104) \n1074 \n\n(783 - 1502) \n \nTable 15 Population predicted steady state PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles) for \ntrastuzumab intravenous dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumourtype N \nCmin,ss* \n\n(mcg/mL) \nCmax,ss**  \n\n(mcg/mL) \nAUCss, 0-21days  \n\n(mcg.day/mL) \nTime to \nsteady- \nstate*** \n\n \n\n8 mg/kg + \n6 mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 44.2 (1.8 - 85.4) \n179 \n\n(123 - 266) \n1736 \n\n(618 - 2756) 12 \n\nEBC 390 53.8 (28.7 - 85.8) \n184 \n\n(134 - 247) \n1927 \n\n(1332 -2771) 15 \n\nAGC 274 32.9 (6.1 \u2013 88.9) \n131 \n\n(72.5 -251) \n1338 \n\n(557 - 2875) 9 \n\n4 mg/kg + \n2 mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 63.1 (11.7 - 107) \n107 \n\n(54.2 - 164) \n1710 \n\n(581 - 2715) 12 \n\nEBC 390 72.6 (46 - 109) \n115 \n\n(82.6 - 160) \n1893 \n\n(1309 -2734) 14 \n\n*Cmin,ss \u2013 Cmin at steady state \n**Cmax,ss = Cmax at steady state \n*** time to 90% of steady-state \n  \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nTable 16 Population predicted PK parameter values at steady state for trastuzumab intravenous dosing \nregimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n \n\nRegimen Primary tumour type N \nTotal CL range from  \n\nCmax,ss to Cmin,ss (L/day) \nt1/2 range from  \n\nCmax,ss to Cmin,ss (day) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 0.183 - 0.302 15.1 - 23.3 \n\nEBC 390 0.158 - 0.253 17.5 \u2013 26.6 \n\nAGC 274 0.189 - 0.337 12.6 - 20.6 \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 0.213 - 0.259 17.2 - 20.4 \n\nEBC 390 0.184 - 0.221 19.7 - 23.2 \n \nTrastuzumab washout \n \nTrastuzumab washout period was assessed following q1w or q3w intravenous administration using the \npopulation PK model.

Zercepac is not genotoxic. A study of trehalose, a major formulation excipient did not reveal \nany toxicities. \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of Zercepac, \nor to determine its effects on fertility in males. \n \n \n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user, unless reconstitution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic \nconditions. \nDo not freeze the reconstituted solution. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C-8 \u00b0C).  \nFor storage conditions of the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \nOne 20 mL clear glass type I vial with bromobutyl rubber stopper containing 150 mg of trastuzumab. \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nZercepac is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials. \n \nSince the medicinal product does not contain any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, \nappropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must be \ntaken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage: \n \nThe infusion preparation should be: \n \n\u2022 performed by trained personnel in accordance with good practice rules especially with respect to \n\nthe aseptic preparation of parenteral products. \n \n\u2022 prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\u2022 followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \n\nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions. \n \nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution: \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection (not supplied) in the \n\nvial containing the lyophilised Zercepac, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake. Use of \nother reconstitution solvents should be avoided. \n\n \n2) Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Zercepac results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nThis yields a 7.5 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at \na pH of approximately 6.0. A volume overage of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be \nwithdrawn from each vial. \n \nZercepac should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted solution may result in problems with the amount of \nZercepac that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n\nThe reconstituted solution should not be frozen. \nInstructions for aseptic dilution of the reconstituted solution \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of \n\n2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of \n\n6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance)  \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag \ncontaining 250 mL of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution. Do not use with glucose-containing \nsolutions (see section 6.2). The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid \nfoaming. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration \nprior to administration. \n \nNo incompatibilities between Zercepac and polypropylene bags have been observed. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nZercepac 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  \ntrastuzumab \n\nThis medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. You can help by reporting any side-effects you may get. See the end of \nsection 4 for how to report side-effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Zercepac is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zercepac  \n3. How Zercepac is given \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Zercepac  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n1. What Zercepac is and what it is used for \n \nZercepac contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an \nantigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on \nthe surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Zercepac binds to HER2 it \nstops the growth of such cells and causes them to die.  \n \nYour doctor may prescribe Zercepac for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when:  \n \n\u2022 You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2.  \n\u2022 You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) \n\nwith high levels of HER2. Zercepac may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy \nmedicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be \nprescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination \nwith medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and hormone \nreceptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex \nhormones).  \n\n\u2022 You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with the \nother cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin. \n\n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Zercepac  \n \nDo not use Zercepac if \n\u2022 you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6).  \n\u2022 you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. \n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \n \nYour doctor will closely supervise your therapy.  \n \nHeart checks  \n \nTreatment with Zercepac alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever used \nan anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer). The \neffects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function will be \nchecked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with \nZercepac. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your \nheart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment \nfor heart failure or you may have to stop Zercepac treatment.  \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Zercepac if:  \n \n\u2022 you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high \n\nblood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood \npressure medicine.  \n\n\u2022 you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines \nused to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle \nand increase the risk of heart problems with Zercepac.  \n\n\u2022 you suffer from breathlessness., especially if you are currently using a taxane. Zercepac can \ncause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you \nare already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment \nhave died when they were given Zercepac.  \n\n\u2022 you have ever had any other treatment for cancer.  \n \n\nIf you receive Zercepac with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an \naromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient \ninformation leaflets for these products.  \n \nChildren and adolescents  \n \nZercepac is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Zercepac  \n \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other \nmedicines.  \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Zercepac to be removed from the body. Therefore you should tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Zercepac if you start any new medicine in the 7 months \nafter stopping treatment.  \n \nPregnancy  \n \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\u2022 You should use effective contraception during treatment with Zercepac and for at least 7 months \n\nafter treatment has ended.  \n\u2022 Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Zercepac during pregnancy. In \n\nrare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby \nwithin the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Zercepac. This condition may \nbe harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not developing \nfully resulting in foetal death.  \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nDo not breast-feed your baby during Zercepac therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of Zercepac \nas Zercepac may pass to your baby through your breast milk.  \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines  \n \nZercepac may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment you experience \nsymptoms, such as chills or fever, you should not drive or use machines until these symptoms \ndisappear. \n \n \n3. How Zercepac is given \n \nBefore starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only \npatients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Zercepac. Zercepac should only be given by \na doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The \ndose of Zercepac depends on your body weight.  \n \nZercepac intravenous formulation is given as an intravenous infusion (\u201cdrip\u201d) directly into your veins. \nThe first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health \nprofessional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. If the first dose is well tolerated \nthe next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings and precautions\u201d). The \nnumber of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. Your doctor will \ndiscuss this with you.  \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine \nbeing prepared and given is Zercepac (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine.  \n \nFor early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, Zercepac is given every \n3 weeks. Zercepac may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. \n \nIf you stop using Zercepac  \n \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the \nright time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your \nmedicine work as well as it can.  \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Zercepac to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may \ndecide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment.  \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Zercepac can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of these \nside effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation.  \n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nSerious side effects \n \nDuring a Zercepac infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very \ncommon (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick \n(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing \ndifficulties, wheezing, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart \nfluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these \nsymptoms can be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings and \nprecautions\u201d).  \n \nThese effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (\u201cdrip\u201d into your vein) and during the \nfirst few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a \nhealth care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion \nand for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or \nstop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion may be \ncontinued after the symptoms improve.  \n \nOccasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, \ncontact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later.  \n \nOther serious side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Zercepac, not just related to an \ninfusion. Tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has \n\nstopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to \nheart failure, inflammation (swollen, red, hot, and in pain) of the lining around the heart and \nheart rhythm disturbances. This can lead to symptoms such as breathlessness (including \nbreathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention (swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart \nfluttering or irregular heart beat) (see 2. Heart checks).  \n\n \nYour doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell \nyour doctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms.  \n\n \n\u2022 Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment \n\ncharacterized by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of \ncalcium). Symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and \nconfusion), heart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, \nvomiting or diarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Zercepac has finished, you \nshould see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Zercepac. \n \nOther side effects \n \nVery common side effects: may affect more than 1 in 10 people  \n \n\u2022 infections  \n\u2022 diarrhoea  \n\u2022 constipation  \n\u2022 heartburn (dyspepsia)  \n\u2022 fatigue \n\u2022 skin rashes  \n\u2022 chest pain  \n\u2022 abdominal pain  \n\u2022 joint pain  \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n\u2022 low counts of red blood cells and white blood cells (which help fight infection) sometimes with \nfever  \n\n\u2022 muscle pain  \n\u2022 conjunctivitis  \n\u2022 watery eyes  \n\u2022 nose bleeds  \n\u2022 runny nose  \n\u2022 hair loss  \n\u2022 tremor  \n\u2022 hot flush  \n\u2022 dizziness  \n\u2022 nail disorders  \n\u2022 weight loss  \n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\u2022 inability to sleep (insomnia) \n\u2022 altered taste \n\u2022 low platelet count \n\u2022 bruising \n\u2022 numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes \n\u2022 redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat \n\u2022 pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet \n\u2022 breathlessness \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 nausea \n \nCommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 10 people \n \n\u2022 allergic reactions \n\u2022 throat infections \n\u2022 bladder and skin infections \n\u2022 shingles \n\u2022 inflammation of the breast \n\u2022 inflammation of the liver \n\u2022 kidney disorders \n\u2022 increased muscle tone or tension (hypertonia) \n\u2022 pain in the arms and/or legs \n\u2022 itchy rash \n\u2022 sleepiness (somnolence) \n\u2022 haemorrhoids \n\u2022 itchiness \n\u2022 dry mouth and skin \n\u2022 dry eyes \n\u2022 sweating \n\u2022 feeling weak and unwell \n\u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 abnormal thinking \n\u2022 asthma \n\u2022 infection of lungs \n\u2022 lung disorders \n\u2022 back pain \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 bone pain \n\u2022 acne \n\u2022 leg cramps \n \nUncommon side effects: may affect up to 1 in 100 people:  \n \n\u2022 deafness  \n\u2022 bumpy rash  \n\u2022 blood infection  \n \nRare side effects: may affect up to 1 in 1000 people  \n \n\u2022 weakness  \n\u2022 jaundice  \n\u2022 inflammation or scarring of the lungs  \n \nSide effects of unknown frequency: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data  \n \n\u2022 abnormal or impaired blood clotting  \n\u2022 anaphylactic reactions  \n\u2022 high potassium levels  \n\u2022 swelling of the brain  \n\u2022 swelling or bleeding at the back of the eyes  \n\u2022 shock  \n\u2022 swelling of the lining of the heart \n\u2022 slow heart rate \n\u2022 abnormal heart rhythm \n\u2022 respiratory distress \n\u2022 respiratory failure \n\u2022 acute accumulation of fluid in the lungs \n\u2022 acute narrowing of the airways \n\u2022 abnormally low oxygen levels in the blood \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing when lying flat \n\u2022 liver damage/failure \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips and throat \n\u2022 kidney failure \n\u2022 abnormally low levels of fluid around baby in womb \n\u2022 failure of the lungs of the baby to develop in the womb \n\u2022 abnormal development of the kidneys of the baby in the womb \n \nSome of the side-effects you experience may be due to your underlying cancer.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \nWhat Zercepac contains  \n \n\n\u2022 The active substance is trastuzumab. Each vial contains 150 mg trastuzumab that has to \nbe dissolved in 7.2 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution contains \napproximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab.  \n\n\u2022 The other ingredient(s) are L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-histidine, \u03b1,\u03b1-\ntrehalose dihydrate, polysorbate 20. \n\n \nWhat Zercepac looks like and contents of the pack  \n \nZercepac is a powder for concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion, which is supplied in a glass \nvial with a rubber stopper containing 150 mg of trastuzumab. The powder is a white to pale yellow \npellet. Each carton contains 1 vial of powder. \n \nMarketing Authorisation Holder  \n \nAccord Healthcare S.L.U.  \nWorld Trade Center,  \nMoll de Barcelona, s/n,  \nEdifici Est 6\u00aa planta,  \n08039 Barcelona, Spain \n \nManufacturer \n \nAccord Healthcare Polska Sp. z.o.o \nul Lutomierska 50, 95-200 Pabianice \nPoland \n \nAccord Healthcare Limited \nSage House, 319 Pinner Road \nHarrow HA1 4HF \nUnited Kingdom \n \nThis leaflet was last revised in <{MM/YYYY}> \n \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nDetailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: \nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu \n \nThis leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only  \n \nZercepac is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials. \n \nAlways keep this medicine in the closed original pack at a temperature of 2 \u00baC-8 \u00baC in a refrigerator.  \n \nSince the medicinal product does not contain any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, \nappropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must be \ntaken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. \n \nA vial of Zercepac aseptically reconstituted with water for injections (not supplied) is chemically and \nphysically stable for 48 hours at 2 \u00baC-8 \u00baC after reconstitution and must not be frozen.  \n \nAfter aseptic dilution in polypropylene bags containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for \ninjection, chemical and physical stability of Zercepac has been demonstrated for up to 7 days at \n2 \u00b0C-8 \u00b0C, and subsequently for 24 hours at 30 \u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Zercepac infusion solution should \nbe used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the \nresponsibility of the user, unless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and \nvalidated aseptic conditions. \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage: \n \nThe infusion preparation should be: \n \n\u2022 performed by trained personnel in accordance with good practice rules especially with respect to \n\nthe aseptic preparation of parenteral products. \n\u2022 prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\u2022 followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \n\nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions. \n \nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution:  \n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.2 mL of water for injection (not supplied) in the vial \n\ncontaining the lyophilised Zercepac, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake. Use of other \nreconstitution solvents should be avoided. \n\n2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE!  \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Zercepac results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nThis yields a 7.5 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. A \nvolume overage of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial.  \n \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nZercepac should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Zercepac may result in problems with the amount of \nZercepac that can be withdrawn from the vial.  \n \nInstructions for aseptic dilution of the reconstituted solution \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required:  \n \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of \n\n2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of \n\n6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a polypropylene \ninfusion bag containing 250 mL of 9 mg/ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution. Do not use with glucose-\ncontaining solutions. The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. \nParenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to \nadministration.  \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

monoclonal antibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an antigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). her2 is found in large amounts on the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. when zercepac binds to her2 it stops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. your doctor may prescribe zercepac for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: you have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called her2. you have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) with high levels of her2. zercepac may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy medicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be prescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. it is also used in combination with medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of her2 and hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex hormones). you have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of her2, when it is in combination with the other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zercepac", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 6,

severe and could cause death. therefore, your heart function will be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with zercepac. if you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment for heart failure or you may have to stop zercepac treatment. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given zercepac if: you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high blood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood pressure medicine. you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin

observed by a health professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. if the first dose is well tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under \"warnings and precautions\"). the number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. your doctor will discuss this with you. in order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine being prepared and given is zercepac (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, zercepac is given every 3 weeks. zercepac may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. if you stop using zercepac do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. all doses should be taken at the right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). this helps your medicine work as well as it can. it may take up to 7 months for zercepac to be removed from your body. therefore your doctor may decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zercepac", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Text": "the
