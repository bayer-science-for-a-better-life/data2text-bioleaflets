CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nBreast cancer \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nOntruzant is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \n(MBC): \n \n- as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two \nchemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least \nan anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor \npositive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these \ntreatments. \n \n- in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not \nreceived chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not \nsuitable. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n- in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not \nreceived chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. \n \n- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients \nwith hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nOntruzant is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer \n(EBC). \n \n- following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) \n(see section 5.1). \n \n- following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination \nwith paclitaxel or docetaxel. \n \n- in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. \n \n- in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Ontruzant therapy, for \nlocally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours >2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 \nand 5.1). \n \nOntruzant should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have \neither HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and \nvalidated assay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nOntruzant in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or \ngastro-oesophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic \ndisease. \n \nOntruzant should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have \nHER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC3+ \nresult. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Ontruzant \ntreatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy (see section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. \n \nOntruzant intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be \nadministered via an intravenous infusion only. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicinal \nproduct being prepared and administered is Ontruzant (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPosology \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance \ndose at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nWeekly schedule \nThe recommended initial loading dose of Ontruzant is 4 mg/kg body weight. The recommended \nweekly maintenance dose of Ontruzant is 2 mg/kg body weight, beginning one week after the \nloading dose. \n \nAdministration in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel \nIn the pivotal trials (H0648g, M77001), paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following \nthe first dose of trastuzumab (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for \npaclitaxel or docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of trastuzumab if the preceding \ndose of trastuzumab was well tolerated. \n \nAdministration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor \nIn the pivotal trial (BO16216) trastuzumab and anastrozole were administered from day 1. There were \nno restrictions on the relative timing of trastuzumab and anastrozole at administration (for dose, see \nthe SmPC for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors). \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nThree-weekly and weekly schedule \nAs a three-weekly regimen the recommended initial loading dose of Ontruzant is 8 mg/kg body \nweight. The recommended maintenance dose of Ontruzant at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg \nbody weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nAs a weekly regimen (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg every week) \nconcomitantly with paclitaxel following chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. \n \nSee section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. \n \nMetastatic gastric cancer \n \nThree-weekly schedule \nThe recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance \ndose at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. \n \nBreast cancer and gastric cancer \n \nDuration of treatment \nPatients with MBC or MGC should be treated with Ontruzant until progression of disease. Patients with \nEBC should be treated with Ontruzant for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs first; \nextending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1). \n \nDose reduction \nNo reductions in the dose of trastuzumab were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue \ntherapy during periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be \nmonitored carefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the SmPC for \npaclitaxel, docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays. \n \nIf left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops \u226510 points from baseline AND to below \n50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately \n\n\n\n5 \n\n3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart failure \n(CHF) has developed, discontinuation of Ontruzant should be strongly considered, unless the benefits \nfor the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nMissed doses \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Ontruzant by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose \n(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as \npossible. Do not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent maintenance doses should be \nadministered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, respectively. \n \nIf the patient has missed a dose of Ontruzant by more than one week, a re-loading dose of \nOntruzant should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly regimen: 4 mg/kg; \nthree-weekly regimen: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Ontruzant maintenance doses \n(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen 6 mg/kg respectively) should be administered \n7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules respectively. \n \nSpecial populations \nDedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not \nbeen carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not shown \nto affect trastuzumab disposition. \n \nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Ontruzant in the paediatric population. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nOntruzant is for intravenous use. The loading dose should be administered as a 90-minute intravenous \ninfusion. Administration as an intravenous push or bolus is prohibited. Ontruzant intravenous infusion \nshould be administered by a health-care provider prepared to manage anaphylaxis and an emergency \nkit should be available. Patients should be observed for at least six hours after the start of the first \ninfusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever and \nchills or other infusion-related symptoms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Interruption or slowing the rate of \nthe infusion may help control such symptoms. The infusion may be resumed when symptoms abate. \n \nIf the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute \ninfusion. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of Ontruzant intravenous formulation before administration, see \nsection 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\u2022 Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n\u2022 Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring \n\nsupplementary oxygen therapy. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of \nthe testing procedures (see section 5.1). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nCurrently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous \nexposure to trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nGeneral considerations \n \nPatients treated with trastuzumab are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart \nAssociation [NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been \nobserved in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or \ndocetaxel, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. \nThese may be moderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, \ncaution should be exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, \ndocumented coronary artery disease, CHF, LVEF of <55%, older age. \n \nAll candidates for treatment with trastuzumab, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop \ncardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every \n3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until \n24 months from the last administration of trastuzumab. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be \nmade before deciding to treat with trastuzumab. \n \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab treatment \nbased on population pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who \nreceive anthracyclines after stopping trastuzumab may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac \ndysfunction. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months \nafter stopping trastuzumab. If anthracyclines are used, the patient\u2019s cardiac function should be \nmonitored carefully. \n \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more \nfrequent monitoring (e.g. every 6-8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular \nfunction, but remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical \nbenefit of trastuzumab therapy has been seen. \n \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab in patients who experience cardiac \ndysfunction has not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops \u226510 points from baseline \nAND to below 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within \napproximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has \ndeveloped, discontinuation of trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the \nindividual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \n \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during trastuzumab therapy, it should be treated with \nstandard medicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac \ndysfunction in pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an \nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a \nbeta-blocker. The majority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of \ntrastuzumab treatment continued on therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nTrastuzumab and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting.  \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac \ndysfunction with trastuzumab treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of \ntrastuzumab and anthracyclines. \n \nEarly breast cancer \n \nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every \n3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months \nfrom the last administration of trastuzumab. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the \nlast administration of trastuzumab, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \n \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II-IV), LVEF of <55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhaemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with trastuzumab and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \n \nAdjuvant treatment \n \nTrastuzumab and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the \nadjuvant treatment setting. \n \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when trastuzumab was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy \ncompared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was \nmore marked when trastuzumab was administered concurrently with taxanes than when \nadministered sequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac \nevents occurred within the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a \nmedian follow-up of 5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative \nrate of symptomatic cardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered \ntrastuzumab concurrently with a taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37% compared to \napproximately 1% in the two comparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by \ntaxane and taxane, carboplatin and trastuzumab). \n \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(>50 years), low LVEF (<55%) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel treatment, \ndecline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive medicinal products. \nIn patients receiving trastuzumab after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the risk of cardiac \ndysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given prior to initiation of \ntrastuzumab and a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. \n \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \n \nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, trastuzumab should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or \nepirubicin 360 mg/m2. \n \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and \ntrastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after \nsurgery. In other situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is \ndetermined based on individual factors. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low-dose anthracycline regimens \nis currently limited to the trial MO16432. \n \nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose \n180 mg/m2). \n \nThe incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7% in the trastuzumab arm. \n \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \n \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity \n \nSerious IRRs to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, \nbronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory \ndistress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication may be used \nto reduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during or within \n2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion should be \ndiscontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until resolution of all \nobserved symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an analgesic/antipyretic \nsuch as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. The majority of \npatients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of \ntrastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, \nbeta-agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course \nculminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of \nadvanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. \nTherefore, these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). \n \nInitial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical \ndeterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week \nfollowing infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms \nand pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the trastuzumab infusion. Patients \nshould be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their \nphysician if these symptoms occur. \n \nPulmonary events \n \nSevere pulmonary events have been reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing \nsetting (see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial \nlung disease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, \npneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory \ninsufficiency have been reported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior \nor concomitant therapy with other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as \ntaxanes, gemcitabine, vinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an \ninfusion-related reaction or with a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to \ncomplications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary \nevents. Therefore, these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). Caution \nshould be exercised for pneumonitis, especially in patients being treated concomitantly with \ntaxanes. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between \ntrastuzumab and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \n \nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites \n6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-paclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of \ntrastuzumab (8 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg loading dose as an intravenous infusion followed by 6 mg/kg q3w \nor 2 mg/kg q1w infusion, respectively).  \nHowever, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite (7-deoxy-13 \ndihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of \nthis metabolite was unclear. \n \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose as an \nintravenous infusion and 2 mg/kg infusion weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) \nin Japanese women with HER2-positive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of \ntrastuzumab had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Study JP19959 was a \nsubstudy of BO18255 (ToGA) performed in male and female Japanese patients with advanced \ngastric cancer to study the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and cisplatin when used with or without \ntrastuzumab. The results of this substudy suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites \n(e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was not affected by concurrent use of cisplatin or by concurrent use of \ncisplatin plus trastuzumab. However, capecitabine itself showed higher concentrations and a longer \nhalf-life when combined with trastuzumab. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of \ncisplatin were not affected by concurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use of capecitabine \nplus trastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of \ncarboplatin. \n \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics \n \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy \n(4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w intravenous infusion) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese \nwomen with HER2-positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent \nadministration of docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \n \nComparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III study \n(H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab and paclitaxel and two \nPhase II studies in which trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982), \nin women with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum \nconcentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant \nadministration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK \ndata from Study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated concomitantly with \ntrastuzumab, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where trastuzumab was \nadministered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nor paclitaxel (H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \n \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with trastuzumab and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \n \nPregnancy \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of \nthe weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation and have \nrevealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab \nduring the early (days 20-50 of gestation) and late (days 120-150 of gestation) fetal development \nperiod was observed. It is not known whether trastuzumab can affect reproductive capacity. As \nanimal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, trastuzumab should be \navoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to \nthe fetus. \n \nIn the post-marketing setting, cases of fetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association \nwith oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the fetus, have been \nreported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. Women who become pregnant should be advised \nof the possibility of harm to the fetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab, or if a patient \nbecomes pregnant while receiving trastuzumab or within 7 months following the last dose of \ntrastuzumab, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. \n \nBreast-feeding \nA study conducted in lactating Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human \nmaintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation demonstrated that trastuzumab \nis secreted in the milk. The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not \nassociated with any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. \nIt is not known whether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into \nhuman milk, and the potential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed \nduring trastuzumab therapy and for 7 months after the last dose. \n \nFertility \nThere is no fertility data available. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nOntruzant may have a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). \nPatients experiencing infusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and \nuse machines until symptoms abate. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nAmongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in Ontruzant usage to date are \ncardiac dysfunction, infusion-related reactions, haematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections \nand pulmonary adverse reactions. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nIn this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (\u22651/10), common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare \n(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Specific \npercentages for these are not available. \n* Observed with combination therapy following anthracyclines and combined with taxanes \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCardiac dysfunction \n \nCongestive heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) is a common adverse reaction associated with the use of \ntrastuzumab and has been associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms of \ncardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 gallop, or \nreduced ventricular ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with trastuzumab (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nIn 3 pivotal clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab given in combination with chemotherapy, the \nincidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure) was \nsimilar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (i.e. did not receive trastuzumab) and \nin patients who were administered trastuzumab sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was \nhighest in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently with a taxane (2.0%). In the \nneoadjuvant setting, the experience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and low-dose \nanthracycline regimen is limited (see section 4.4). \n \nWhen trastuzumab was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III-IV \nheart failure was observed in 0.6% of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of \n12 months. In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF \n(NYHA Class III & IV) in the trastuzumab 1-year treatment arm was 0.8%, and the rate of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6%. \n \nReversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values \u226550% \nafter the event) was evident for 71.4% of trastuzumab-treated patients. Reversibility of mild \nsymptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5% of patients. \nApproximately 17% of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of trastuzumab. \n \nIn the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous trastuzumab, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction varied \nbetween 9% and 12% when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1%-4% for paclitaxel \nalone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6%-9%. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction was seen in \npatients receiving trastuzumab concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (27%), and was \nsignificantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7%-10%). In a subsequent trial \nwith prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic CHF was 2.2% in \npatients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with 0% in patients receiving docetaxel alone. \nMost of the patients (79%) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these trials experienced an \nimprovement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. \n \nInfusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity \nIt is estimated that approximately 40% of patients who are treated with trastuzumab will experience \nsome form of infusion-related reaction. However, the majority of infusion-related reactions are mild \nto moderate in intensity (NCI-CTC grading system) and tend to occur earlier in treatment, i.e. during \ninfusions one, two and three and lessen in frequency in subsequent infusions. Reactions include chills, \nfever, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, \n\n\n\n15 \n\nrespiratory distress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache (see section 4.4). The rate of \ninfusion-related reactions of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data \ncollection methodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as \nmonotherapy. \n \nSevere anaphylactic reactions requiring immediate additional intervention can occur usually during \neither the first or second infusion of trastuzumab (see section 4.4) and have been associated with a \nfatal outcome. \n \nAnaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. \n \nHaematotoxicity \nFebrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very \ncommonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinaemia is not known. The risk of \nneutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel \nfollowing anthracycline therapy. \n \nPulmonary events \nSevere pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of trastuzumab and have \nbeen associated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, \nacute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, \nacute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). \n \nDetails of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are \npresented in (section 4.4) Warnings and Precautions. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nIn the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, \n10.1% (30/296) of patients treated with intravenous trastuzumab developed antibodies against \ntrastuzumab. Neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of \n30 patients in the trastuzumab intravenous arm. \n \nThe clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known. The presence of anti-trastuzumab \nantibodies had no impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete \nResponse [pCR] and event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of \nadministration related reactions (ARRs) of trastuzumab intravenous. \n \nThere are no immunogenicity data available for trastuzumab in gastric cancer. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. Single doses of trastuzumab alone \ngreater than 10 mg/kg have not been administered in the clinical trials; a maintenance dose of \n10 mg/kg q3w following a loading dose of 8 mg/kg has been studied in a clinical trial with metastatic \ngastric cancer patients. Doses up to this level were well tolerated. \n \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC03 \n \nOntruzant is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the \nEuropean Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n \nTrastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of primary \nbreast cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry \n(IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) \nhave shown that there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 34.0% for IHC \nand 7.1% to 42.6% for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress \nHER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not \noverexpress HER2. The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood \nstream and measured in serum samples. \n \nMechanism of action \nTrastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of \nHER2\u2019s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 \nsignalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation \nmechanism of HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in \nanimals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, \ntrastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). \nIn vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 \noverexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer \nTrastuzumab should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 \ngene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should \nbe detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see \nsection 4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation \n(FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for \ntrastuzumab treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC \nor a positive FISH or CISH result. \n \nTo ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised \nlaboratory, which can ensure validation of the testing procedures. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in \nTable 2: \n \nTable 2 Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns in breast cancer \n\nScore Staining pattern HER2 overexpression \nassessment \n\n0 No staining is observed or membrane staining is \nobserved in <10% of the tumour cells Negative \n\n1+ \nA faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is \ndetected in >10% of the tumour cells.

Equivocal \n\n\n\n17 \n\nScore Staining pattern HER2 overexpression \nassessment \n\n3+ Strong complete membrane staining is detected in >10% \nof the tumour cells. Positive \n\n \nIn general, FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour cell to \nthe chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2, or if there are more than 4 copies of the \nHER2 gene per tumour cell if no chromosome 17 control is used. \n \nIn general, CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus \nin greater than 50% of tumour cells. \n \nFor full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of \nvalidated FISH and CISH assays. Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. \n \nFor any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the \nanalyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance \nof validated methods. Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate \noverexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and \nstrong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. \n \nDetection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer \nOnly an accurate and validated assay should be used to detect HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene \namplification. IHC is recommended as the first testing modality and in cases where HER2 gene \namplification status is also required, either a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) or a FISH \ntechnique must be applied. SISH technology is however, recommended to allow for the parallel \nevaluation of tumor histology and morphology. To ensure validation of testing procedures and the \ngeneration of accurate and reproducible results, HER2 testing must be performed in a laboratory \nstaffed by trained personnel. Full instructions on assay performance and results interpretation \nshould be taken from the product information leaflet provided with the HER2 testing assays used. \n \nIn the ToGA (BO18255) trial, patients whose tumours were either IHC3+ or FISH positive were \ndefined as HER2 positive and thus included in the trial. Based on the clinical trial results, the \nbeneficial effects were limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression, \ndefined by a 3+ score by IHC, or a 2+ score by IHC and a positive FISH result. \n \nIn a method comparison study (study D008548) a high degree of concordance (>95%) was observed \nfor SISH and FISH techniques for the detection of HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer patients. \n \nHER2 over expression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of \nfixed tumour blocks; HER2 gene amplification should be detected using in situ hybridisation using \neither SISH or FISH on fixed tumour blocks. \n \nThe recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 3: \n \n\n\n\n18 \n\nTable 3 Recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns in gastric cancer \n\nScore Surgical specimen \u2013 staining \npattern \n\nBiopsy specimen - staining \npattern \n\nHER2 \noverexpression \n\nassessment \n\n0 \nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in <10% of tumour \ncells \n\nNo reactivity or membranous \nreactivity in any tumour cell Negative \n\n1+ \n\nFaint \u2044 barely perceptible \nmembranous reactivity in \n\u226510% of tumour cells; cells \nare reactive only in part of \ntheir membrane \n\nTumour cell cluster with a \nfaint\u2044barely perceptible \nmembranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nNegative \n\n2+ \n\nWeak to moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity in \n\u226510% of tumour cells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a weak \nto moderate complete, \nbasolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nEquivocal \n\n3+ \n\nStrong complete, basolateral \nor lateral membranous \nreactivity in \u226510% of tumour \ncells \n\nTumour cell cluster with a strong \ncomplete, basolateral or lateral \nmembranous reactivity \nirrespective of percentage of \ntumour cells stained \n\nPositive \n\n \nIn general, SISH or FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour \ncell to the chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nMetastatic breast cancer \n \nTrastuzumab has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have \ntumours that overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their \nmetastatic disease (trastuzumab alone). \n \nTrastuzumab has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of \npatients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had \npreviously received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel \n(175 mg/m2 infused over 3 hours) with or without trastuzumab. In the pivotal trial of docetaxel \n(100 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour) with or without trastuzumab, 60% of the patients had received prior \nanthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with trastuzumab until progression \nof disease. \n \nThe efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior \nadjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied. However, trastuzumab plus docetaxel was efficacious in \npatients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. \n \nThe test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal \ntrastuzumab monotherapy and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed \nimmunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine \nmonoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin\u2019s fixative. \nThis investigative clinical trial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. \nPatients classified as staining 2+ or 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. \nGreater than 70% of patients enrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial \neffects were greater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). \n \n\n\n\n19 \n\nThe main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or \nwithout trastuzumab, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using \nfluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). In this trial, 87% of patients entered had disease that was \nIHC3+, and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive. \n \nWeekly dosing in metastatic breast cancer \nThe efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies are summarised in Table 4: \n \nTable 4 Efficacy results from the monotherapy and combination therapy studies \n\nParameter Monotherapy Combination therapy \n\n Trastuzumab1 \nN=172 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus \n\npaclitaxel2 \n\nN=68 \n\nPaclitaxel2 \n\nN=77 \n\nTrastuzumab \nplus \n\ndocetaxel3 \n\nN=92 \n\nDocetaxel3 \nN=94 \n\nResponse rate \n(95%CI) \n\n18% \n(13-25) \n\n49% \n(36-61) \n\n17% \n(9-27) \n\n61% \n(50-71) \n\n34% \n(25-45) \n\nMedian duration of \nresponse (months) \n(95%CI) \n\n9.1 \n(5.6-10.3) \n\n8.3 \n(7.3-8.8) \n\n4.6 \n(3.7-7.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.3-15.0) \n\n5.7 \n(4.6-7.6) \n\nMedian TTP \n(months) (95%CI) \n\n3.2 \n(2.6-3.5) \n\n7.1 \n(6.2-12.0) \n\n3.0 \n(2.0-4.4) \n\n11.7 \n(9.2-13.5) \n\n6.1 \n(5.4-7.2) \n\nMedian survival \n(months) (95%CI) \n\n16.4 \n(12.3-ne) \n\n24.8 \n(18.6-33.7) \n\n17.9 \n(11.2-23.8) \n\n31.2 \n(27.3-40.8) \n\n22.74 \n(19.1-30.8) \n\nTTP = time to progression; \"ne\" indicates that it could not be estimated or it was not yet reached. \n1.

Progression free survival was doubled in the trastuzumab \nplus anastrozole arm compared to anastrozole (4.8 months versus 2.4 months). For the other \nparameters the improvements seen for the combination were for overall response (16.5% versus \n6.7%); clinical benefit rate (42.7% versus 27.9%); time to progression (4.8 months versus \n2.4 months).

In addition, comparison of two \nyears of trastuzumab treatment versus one year of trastuzumab treatment was performed. \nPatients assigned to receive trastuzumab were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg, \nfollowed by 6 mg/kg every three weeks for either one or two years. \n\n- The NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies that comprise the joint analysis were \ndesigned to investigate the clinical utility of combining trastuzumab treatment with \npaclitaxel following AC chemotherapy, additionally the NCCTG N9831 study also \ninvestigated adding trastuzumab sequentially to AC\u2192P chemotherapy in patients with \nHER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n- The BCIRG 006 study was designed to investigate combining trastuzumab treatment \nwith docetaxel either following AC chemotherapy or in combination with docetaxel and \ncarboplatin in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery. \n\n \nEarly breast cancer in the HERA trial was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma \nof the breast, with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in \ndiameter. \n \nIn the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, EBC was limited to women \nwith operable breast cancer at high risk, defined as HER2-positive and axillary lymph node \npositive or HER2 positive and lymph node negative with high-risk features (tumour size >1 cm and \nER negative or tumour size >2 cm, regardless of hormonal status). \n \nIn the BCIRG 006 study HER2 positive, EBC was defined as either lymph node positive or \nhigh-risk node negative patients with no (pN0) lymph node involvement, and at least 1 of the \nfollowing factors: tumour size greater than 2 cm, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor \nnegative, histological and/or nuclear grade 2-3, or age <35 years). \n \nThe efficacy results from the BO16348 trial following 12 months* and 8 years** median \nfollow-up are summarized in Table 6: \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nTable 6 Efficacy results from Study BO16348 \n\n Median follow-up \n12 months* \n\nMedian follow-up \n8 years** \n\nParameter Observation \nN=1693 \n\nTrastuzumab \n1 Year \nN=1693 \n\nObservation \nN=1697*** \n\nTrastuzumab \n1 Year \n\nN=1702*** \nDisease-free survival   \n- No. patients with event 219 (12.9%) 127 (7.5%) 570 (33.6%) 471 (27.7%) \n- No. patients without event 1474 (87.1%) 1566 (92.5%) 1127 (66.4%) 1231 (72.3%) \nP-value versus observation <0.0001 < 0.0001 \nHazard ratio versus observation 0.54 0.76 \nRecurrence-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 208 (12.3%) 113 (6.7%) 506 (29.8%) 399 (23.4%) \n- No. patients without event 1485 (87.7%) 1580 (93.3%) 1191 (70.2%) 1303 (76.6%) \nP-value versus observation <0.0001 <0.0001 \nHazard ratio versus \nobservation \n\n0.51 0.73 \n\nDistant disease-free survival     \n- No. patients with event 184 (10.9%) 99 (5.8%) 488 (28.8%) 399 (23.4%) \n- No. patients without event 1508 (89.1%) 1594 (94.6%) 1209 (71.2%) 1303 (76.6%) \nP-value versus observation <0.0001 <0.0001 \nHazard ratio versus observation 0.50 0.76 \nOverall survival (death)     \n- No. patients with event 40 (2.4%) 31 (1.8%) 350 (20.6%) 278 (16.3%) \n- No. patients without event 1653 (97.6%) 1662 (98.2%) 1347 (79.4%) 1424 (83.7%) \nP-value versus observation 0.24 0.0005 \nHazard ratio versus observation 0.75 0.76 \n*Co-primary endpoint of DFS of 1 year versus observation met the pre-defined statistical boundary \n**Final analysis (including crossover of 52% of patients from the observation arm to trastuzumab) \n*** There is a discrepancy in the overall sample size due to a small number of patients who were \nrandomized after the cut-off date for the 12-month median follow-up analysis \n \nThe efficacy results from the interim efficacy analysis crossed the protocol pre-specified \nstatistical boundary for the comparison of 1-year of trastuzumab versus observation. After a \nmedian follow-up of 12 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for disease free survival (DFS) was 0.54 \n(95% CI 0.44, 0.67) which translates into an absolute benefit, in terms of a 2-year disease-free \nsurvival rate, of 7.6 percentage points (85.8% versus 78.2%) in favour of the trastuzumab arm. \n \nA final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 8 years, which showed that 1-year \ntrastuzumab treatment is associated with a 24% risk reduction compared to observation only \n(HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67, 0.86). This translates into an absolute benefit in terms of an 8-year disease \nfree survival rate of 6.4 percentage points in favour of 1-year trastuzumab treatment. \n \nIn this final analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show \nadditional benefit over treatment for 1 year [DFS HR in the intent to treat (ITT) population of 2 years \nversus 1 year=0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value=0.90 and OS HR=0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value=0.78]. \nThe rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year treatment arm (8.1% versus \n4.6% in the 1-year treatment arm). More patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event \nin the 2-year treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the 1-year treatment arm (16.3%). \n \nIn the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies trastuzumab was administered in combination \nwith paclitaxel, following AC chemotherapy. \n \n\nDoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were administered concurrently as follows: \n \n\n- intravenous push doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2, given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n- intravenous cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, given every 3 weeks for \n4 cycles. \n\n \nPaclitaxel, in combination with trastuzumab, was administered as follows: \n\n \n- intravenous paclitaxel - 80 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every week for \n\n12 weeks. \nor \n\n- intravenous paclitaxel - 175 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every 3 weeks \nfor 4 cycles (day 1 of each cycle). \n\n \nThe efficacy results from the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG 9831 trials at the time of \nthe definitive analysis of DFS* are summarized in Table 7.

At the time of \nthe analysis a total of 349 randomized patients had died: 182 patients (62.8%) in the control arm and \n167 patients (56.8%) in the treatment arm. The majority of the deaths were due to events related to \nthe underlying cancer. \n \nPost-hoc subgroup analyses indicate that positive treatment effects are limited to targeting \ntumours with higher levels of HER2 protein (IHC2+/FISH+ or IHC3+). The median overall \nsurvival for the high HER2-expressing group was 11.8 months versus 16 months, HR 0.65 (95% \nCI 0.51-0.83) and the median progression free survival was 5.5 months versus 7.6 months, HR 0.64 \n(95% CI 0.51-0.79) for FP versus FP + H, respectively.

A two-compartment model with parallel linear and \nnon-linear elimination from the central compartment described the trastuzumab concentration-time \nprofile. Due to non-linear elimination, total clearance increased with decreasing concentration. \nTherefore, no constant value for half-life of trastuzumab can be deduced. The t1/2 decreases with \ndecreasing concentrations within a dosing interval (see Table 16). MBC and EBC patients had \nsimilar PK parameters (e.g. clearance (CL), the central compartment volume (Vc)) and \npopulation-predicted steady-state exposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC). Linear clearance was 0.136 L/day \nfor MBC, 0.112 L/day for EBC and 0.176 L/day for AGC. The non-linear elimination parameter \nvalues were 8.81 mg/day for the maximum elimination rate (Vmax) and 8.92 \u00b5g/mL for the \nMichaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the MBC, EBC, and AGC patients. The central compartment \nvolume was 2.62 L for patients with MBC and EBC and 3.63 L for patients with AGC. In the final \npopulation PK model, in addition to primary tumour type, body-weight, serum aspartate \naminotransferase and albumin were identified as statistically significant covariates affecting the \nexposure of trastuzumab. However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on trastuzumab \nexposure suggests that these covariates are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on \ntrastuzumab concentrations. \n \nThe population predicted PK exposure values (median with 5th-95th Percentiles) and PK \nparameter values at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax and Cmin) for MBC, EBC and AGC \npatients treated with the approved q1w and q3w dosing regimens are shown in Table 14 \n(Cycle 1), Table 15 (steady-state), and Table 16 (PK parameters). \n \nTable 14 Population predicted cycle 1 PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles) for \ntrastuzumab intravenous infusion dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n\nRegimen Primary \ntumour type N Cmin \n\n(\u00b5g/mL) \nCmax \n\n(\u00b5g/mL) \nAUC0-21days \n\n(\u00b5g.day/mL) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 28.7  \n(2.9-46.3) 182 (134-280) 1376 (728-1998) \n\nEBC 390 30.9  \n(18.7-45.5) 176 (127-227) 1390 (1039-1895) \n\nAGC 274 23.1  \n(6.1-50.3) 132 (84.2-225) 1109 (588-1938) \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 37.4  \n(8.7-58.9) 76.5 (49.4-114) 1073 (597-1584) \n\nEBC 390 38.9  \n(25.3-58.8) 76.0 (54.7-104) 1074 (783-1502) \n\n \nTable 15 Population predicted steady state PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th percentiles) for \ntrastuzumab intravenous infusion dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n\nRegimen Primary \ntumour type N Cmin,ss* \n\n(\u00b5g/mL) \nCmax,ss** \n(\u00b5g/mL) \n\nAUCss, 0-21 days \n(\u00b5g.day/mL) \n\nTime to \nsteady-state\n\n*** \n(week) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 44.2 \n(1.8-85.4) \n\n179 \n(123-266) \n\n1736 \n(618-2756) 12 \n\nEBC 390 53.8 \n(28.7-85.8) \n\n184 \n(134-247) \n\n1927 \n(1332-2771) 15 \n\nAGC 274 32.9 \n(6.1-88.9) \n\n131 \n(72.5-251) \n\n1338 \n(557-2875) 9 \n\n\n\n28 \n\nRegimen Primary \ntumour type N Cmin,ss* \n\n(\u00b5g/mL) \nCmax,ss** \n(\u00b5g/mL) \n\nAUCss, 0-21 days \n(\u00b5g.day/mL) \n\nTime to \nsteady-state\n\n*** \n(week) \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 63.1 \n(11.7-107) \n\n107 \n(54.2-164) \n\n1710 \n(581-2715) 12 \n\nEBC 390 72.6 \n(46-109) \n\n115 \n(82.6-160) \n\n1893 \n(1309-2734) 14 \n\n*Cmin,ss \u2013 Cmin at steady state \n**Cmax,ss = Cmax at steady state \n*** time to 90% of steady-state \n \nTable 16 Population predicted PK parameter values at steady state for trastuzumab intravenous \ninfusion dosing regimens in MBC, EBC and AGC patients \n\nRegimen Primary \ntumour type N \n\nTotal CL range \nfrom Cmax,ss to Cmin,ss \n\n(L/day) \n\nt1/2 range from Cmax,ss to \nCmin,ss \n(day) \n\n8mg/kg + \n6mg/kg q3w \n\nMBC 805 0.183-0.302 15.1-23.3 \nEBC 390 0.158-0.253 17.5-26.6 \nAGC 274 0.189-0.337 12.6-20.6 \n\n4mg/kg + \n2mg/kg qw \n\nMBC 805 0.213-0.259 17.2-20.4 \nEBC 390 0.184-0.221 19.7-23.2 \n\n \nTrastuzumab washout \nTrastuzumab washout period was assessed following q1w or q3w intravenous administration using the \npopulation PK model.

Trastuzumab is not genotoxic. A study of trehalose, a major formulation excipient, did not \nreveal any toxicities. \n \nNo long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of \ntrastuzumab, or to determine its effects on fertility in males. \n \n \n6.

If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user, and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, \nunless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C). \n \nDo not freeze the reconstituted solution. \n \nFor storage conditions of the opened medicinal product, see section 6.3 and 6.6. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nOntruzant 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nOne 15 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film \ncontaining 150 mg of trastuzumab \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \nOntruzant 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nOne 40 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film \ncontaining 420 mg of trastuzumab \n \nEach carton contains one vial. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nOntruzant IV is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials. \n \nAppropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care \nmust be taken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does \n\n\n\n30 \n\nnot contain any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must \nbe observed. \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage: \nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be: \n\u2022 performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice rules \n\nespecially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products. \n\u2022 prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\u2022 followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \n\nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions \n \nOntruzant should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted solution may result in problems with the amount of \nOntruzant that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \nThe reconstituted solution should not be frozen. \n \nOntruzant 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nEach 150 mg vial of Ontruzant is reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection (not \nsupplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. \nThis yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, \nat a pH of approximately 6.0. A volume overage of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can \nbe withdrawn from each vial. \n \nOntruzant 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \n \nEach 420 mg vial of Ontruzant is reconstituted with 20 mL of sterile water for injection (not \nsupplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. \nThis yields a 21 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, \nat a pH of approximately 6.0. A volume overage of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of 420 mg can \nbe withdrawn from each vial. \n \n\nOntruzant vial  Volume of sterile water for \ninjections \n\n Final concentration \n\n150 mg vial + 7.2 mL = 21 mg/mL \n420 mg vial + 20 mL = 21 mg/mL \n\n  \nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of sterile water for \ninjection in the vial containing the lyophilised Ontruzant, directing the stream into the lyophilised \ncake. \n2) Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Ontruzant results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nInstructions for aseptic dilution of the reconstituted solution \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg \ntrastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of 6 mg \ntrastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag \ncontaining 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions \n(see section 6.2). The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. \n \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and \ndiscoloration prior to administration. \n \nNo incompatibilities between Ontruzant and polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags \nhave been observed. \n \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects.  \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any \n\npossible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Ontruzant is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you are given Ontruzant \n3. How Ontruzant is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Ontruzant \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Ontruzant is and what it is used for \n \nOntruzant contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal \nantibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an \nantigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts on \nthe surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Ontruzant binds to HER2 it \nstops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. \n \nYour doctor may prescribe Ontruzant for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: \n\u2022 You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2. \n\u2022 You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) with \n\nhigh levels of HER2. Ontruzant may be prescribed in combination with the chemotherapy \nmedicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer or it may be \nprescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in combination with \nmedicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of HER2 and hormone \nreceptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the presence of female sex \nhormones). \n\n\u2022 You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with the \nother cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Ontruzant \n \nDo not use Ontruzant if \n\u2022 you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients of \n\nthis medicine (listed in section 6). \n\u2022 you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen treatment. \n \n\n\n\n45 \n\nWarnings and precautions \n \nYour doctor will closely supervise your therapy. \n \nHeart checks \nTreatment with Ontruzant (alone or with a taxane) may affect the heart, especially if you have ever \nused an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat \ncancer). \nThe effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function will be \nchecked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with \nOntruzant. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your \nheart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment \nfor heart failure or you may have to stop Ontruzant treatment. \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Ontruzant if: \n \n\u2022 you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high \n\nblood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood \npressure medicine. \n\n \n\u2022 you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines \n\nused to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle \nand increase the risk of heart problems with Ontruzant. \n\n \n\u2022 you suffer from breathlessness., especially if you are currently using a taxane. Ontruzant can \n\ncause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you are \nalready breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have \ndied when they were given Ontruzant. \n\n \n\u2022 you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. \n \nIf you receive Ontruzant with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an \naromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient \ninformation leaflets for these products. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nOntruzant is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. \n \nOther medicines and Ontruzant \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other \nmedicines. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Ontruzant to be removed from the body. Therefore you should tell your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Ontruzant if you start any new medicine in the 7 months \nafter stopping treatment. \n \nPregnancy \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. \n\u2022 You should use effective contraception during treatment with Ontruzant and for at least 7 months \n\nafter treatment has ended. \n\u2022 Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Ontruzant during pregnancy. In \n\nrare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby within \nthe womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Ontruzant. This condition may be \nharmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not developing fully \nresulting in fetal death. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n\nBreast-feeding \nDo not breast-feed your baby during Ontruzant therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of \nOntruzant as Ontruzant may pass to your baby through your breast milk. \n \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nOntruzant may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment you \nexperience symptoms, such as chills or fever, you should not drive or use machines until these \nsymptoms disappear. \n \n \n3. How Ontruzant is given \n \nBefore starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only \npatients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Ontruzant. Ontruzant should only be given \nby a doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The \ndose of Ontruzant depends on your body weight. \n \nOntruzant is given as an infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion, \u201cdrip\u201d). This intravenous \nformulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous infusion only. \n \nThe first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health \nprofessional while it is being given in case you have any side effects (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings \nand precautions\u201d). If the first dose is well tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes. The \nnumber of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. Your doctor will \ndiscuss this with you. \n \nIn order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine \nbeing prepared and given is Ontruzant (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. \n \nOntruzant is given every 3 weeks for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic \ngastric cancer. Ontruzant may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. \n \nIf you stop using Ontruzant \nDo not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the \nright time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your \nmedicine work as well as it can. \n \nIt may take up to 7 months for Ontruzant to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may \ndecide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, Ontruzant can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of these \nside effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\nDuring an Ontruzant infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very \ncommon (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick \n(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing \ndifficulties, wheezing, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart \nfluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these \nsymptoms can be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under \u201cWarnings and \nprecautions\u201d). \n \nThese effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (\u201cdrip\u201d into your vein) and during the \nfirst few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a \nhealth care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion \nand for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or \nstop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion may be \ncontinued after the symptoms improve. \n \nOccasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, \ncontact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. \n \nSerious side effects \n \nOther side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Ontruzant, not just related to an \ninfusion. Tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: \n \n\u2022 Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has \n\nstopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart \nfailure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This can lead to \nsymptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention \n(swelling) in the legs or arms, palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat) (see 2. Heart \nchecks). \n\n \nYour doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your \ndoctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. \n \n\u2022 Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment \n\ncharacterized by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of calcium). \nSymptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and confusion), \nheart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, vomiting or \ndiarrhoea and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. \n\n \nIf you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Ontruzant has finished, you \nshould see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Ontruzant. \n \nThe following list of side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Ontruzant, not just \nrelated to an infusion. \n \nVery common side effects of Ontruzant (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n\u2022 infections \n\u2022 diarrhoea \n\u2022 constipation \n\u2022 dyspepsia (heartburn) \n\u2022 fatigue \n\u2022 skin rashes \n\u2022 chest pain \n\u2022 abdominal pain \n\u2022 joint pain \n\u2022 low counts of red blood cells and white blood cells (which help fight infection) sometimes with \n\nfever \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\u2022 muscle pain \n\u2022 conjunctivitis \n\u2022 watery eyes \n\u2022 nose bleeds \n\u2022 runny nose \n\u2022 hair loss \n\u2022 tremor \n\u2022 hot flush \n\u2022 dizziness \n\u2022 nail disorders \n\u2022 weight loss \n\u2022 loss of appetite \n\u2022 insomnia (inability to sleep) \n\u2022 altered taste \n\u2022 low platelet count \n\u2022 bruising \n\u2022 numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes \n\u2022 redness, swelling or sores in your mouth and/or throat \n\u2022 pain, swelling, redness or tingling of hands and/or feet \n\u2022 breathlessness \n\u2022 headache \n\u2022 cough \n\u2022 vomiting \n\u2022 nausea \n \nCommon side effects of Ontruzant (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): \n \n\u2022 allergic reactions \n\u2022 throat infections \n\u2022 bladder and skin infections \n\u2022 shingles \n\u2022 inflammation of the breast \n\u2022 inflammation of the liver \n\u2022 kidney disorders \n\u2022 hypertonia \n (increased muscle tone or tension) \n\u2022 pain in the arms and/or legs \n\u2022 itchy rash \n\u2022 somnolence (sleepiness) \n\u2022 haemorrhoids \n\u2022 itchiness \n\u2022 leg cramps \n\n\u2022 dry mouth and skin \n\u2022 dry eyes \n\u2022 sweating \n\u2022 feeling weak and unwell \n\u2022 anxiety \n\u2022 depression \n\u2022 abnormal thinking \n\u2022 asthma \n\u2022 infection of lungs \n\u2022 lung disorders \n\u2022 back pain \n\u2022 neck pain \n\u2022 bone pain \n\u2022 acne \n \n\n \nUncommon side effects of Ontruzant (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n \n\u2022 deafness \n\u2022 bumpy rash \n\u2022 blood infection \n \nRare side effects of Ontruzant (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): \n \n\u2022 muscle weakness \n\u2022 jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin or eyes) \n\u2022 inflammation or scarring of the lungs \n \n\n\n\n49 \n\nOther side effects that have been reported with Ontruzant use (frequency cannot be estimated \nfrom the available data): \n \n\u2022 abnormal or impaired blood clotting \n\u2022 anaphylactic reactions (serious allergic reaction) \n\u2022 high potassium levels \n\u2022 swelling of the brain \n\u2022 swelling or bleeding at the back of the eyes \n\u2022 shock \n\u2022 swelling of the lining of the heart \n\u2022 slow heart rate \n\u2022 abnormal heart rhythm \n\u2022 respiratory distress \n\u2022 respiratory failure \n\u2022 acute accumulation of fluid in the lungs \n\u2022 acute narrowing of the airways \n\u2022 abnormally low oxygen levels in the blood \n\u2022 difficulty in breathing when lying flat \n\u2022 liver damage/failure \n\u2022 swelling of the face, lips and throat \n\u2022 kidney failure \nDuring pregnancy: \n\u2022 abnormally low levels of fluid around baby in womb \n\u2022 failure of the lungs of the baby to develop in the womb \n\u2022 abnormal development of the kidneys of the baby in the womb \n \nSome of the side effects you experience may be due to your underlying cancer.

Care must be \ntaken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain any \nanti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed. \n \nA vial of Ontruzant aseptically reconstituted with sterile water for injections (not supplied) is \nchemically and physically stable for 7 days at 2\u00baC - 8\u00baC after reconstitution and must not be frozen. \n \nAfter aseptic dilution in polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags containing sodium \nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, chemical and physical stability of Ontruzant has \nbeen demonstrated for up to  30 days at 2\u00baC - 8\u00baC, and subsequently for 24 hours at temperatures not \nexceeding 30\u00b0C. \n \nFrom a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Ontruzant infusion solution \nshould be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use \nare the responsibility of the user, and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, \nunless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. \n \nAseptic preparation, handling and storage: \nAseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be: \n\u2022 performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice rules \n\nespecially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products. \n\u2022 prepared in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet using standard precautions for the \n\nsafe handling of intravenous agents. \n\u2022 followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure \n\nmaintenance of the aseptic conditions \n \nOntruzant 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nEach 150 mg vial of Ontruzant is reconstituted with 7.2 mL of water for injections (not supplied). Use \nof other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. This yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, \ncontaining approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. A volume overage of 4% ensures that the labelled \ndose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial. \n \nOntruzant 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion \nEach 420 mg vial of Ontruzant is reconstituted with 20 mL of water for injections (not supplied). Use \nof other reconstitution solvents should be avoided. This yields a 21 mL solution for single-dose use, \ncontaining approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. A volume overage of 5% ensures that the labelled \ndose of 420 mg can be withdrawn from each vial. \n \n\nOntruzant vial  Volume of sterile water for \ninjections \n\n Final concentration \n\n150 mg vial + 7.2 mL = 21 mg/mL \n420 mg vial + 20 mL = 21 mg/mL \n\n \nInstructions for aseptic reconstitution: \n \nOntruzant should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during \nreconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Ontruzant may result in problems with the amount of \nOntruzant that can be withdrawn from the vial. \n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of water for injections \nin the vial containing the lyophilised Ontruzant, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake. \n2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! \n \nSlight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed \nfor approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Ontruzant results in a colourless to pale yellow \ntransparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. \n \nInstructions for aseptic dilution of the reconstituted solution: \n \nDetermine the volume of the solution required: \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of \n\n2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \n\u2022 based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of \n\n6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: \n \n\nVolume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) \n21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) \n\n \nThe appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a \npolyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% sodium \nchloride solution. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions. The bag should be gently inverted to \nmix the solution in order to avoid foaming. Parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for \nparticulates and discoloration prior to administration. \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

checks treatment with ontruzant (alone or with a taxane) may affect the heart, especially if you have ever used an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat cancer). the effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. therefore, your heart function will be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with ontruzant. if you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), your heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive treatment for heart failure or you may have to stop ontruzant treatment. talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given ontruzant if: you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high blood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood pressure medicine. you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin (medicines used to treat cancer). these medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage heart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with ontruzant. you suffer from breathlessness., especially if you are currently using a taxane. ontruzant can cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. this could be more serious if you are already breathless. very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have died when they were given ontruzant. you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. if you receive ontruzant with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an aromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient

infusion into a vein (intravenous infusion, \"drip\"). this intravenous formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous infusion only. the first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects (see section 2 under \"warnings and precautions\"). if the first dose is well tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes. the number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment. your doctor will discuss this with you. in order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the medicine being prepared and given is ontruzant (trastuzumab) and not trastuzumab emtansine. ontruzant is given every 3 weeks for early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. ontruzant may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. if you stop using ontruzant do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. all doses should be taken at the right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). this helps your medicine work as well as it can. it may take up to 7 months for ontruzant to be removed from your body. therefore your doctor may decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish
