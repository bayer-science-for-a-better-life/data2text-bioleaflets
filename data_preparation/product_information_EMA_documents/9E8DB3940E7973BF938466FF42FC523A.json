NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nTwinrix Adult, suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe \nHepatitis A (inactivated) and hepatitis B (rDNA) (HAB) vaccine (adsorbed). \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n1 dose (1 ml) contains: \n \nHepatitis A virus (inactivated)1,2 720 ELISA Units \nHepatitis B surface antigen3,4 20 micrograms \n \n1Produced on human diploid (MRC-5) cells \n2Adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide, hydrated 0.05 milligrams Al3+ \n3Produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology \n4Adsorbed on aluminium phosphate 0.4 milligrams Al3+ \n \nThe vaccine may contain traces of neomycin which is used during the manufacturing process (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSuspension for injection. \nTurbid white suspension. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTwinrix Adult is indicated for use in non immune adults and adolescents 16 years of age and above \nwho are at risk of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology \n \n- Dosage \n \nA dose of 1.0 ml is recommended for adults and adolescents 16 years of age and above. \n \n- Primary vaccination schedule \n \nThe standard primary course of vaccination with Twinrix Adult consists of three doses, the first \nadministered at the elected date, the second one month later and the third six months after the first \ndose. \n \nIn exceptional circumstances in adults, when travel is anticipated within one month or more after \ninitiating the vaccination course, but where insufficient time is available to allow the standard 0, 1, 6 \nmonth schedule to be completed, a schedule of three intramuscular injections given at 0, 7 and 21 days \nmay be used. When this schedule is applied, a fourth dose is recommended 12 months after the first \ndose. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \nThe recommended schedule should be adhered to. Once initiated, the primary course of vaccination \nshould be completed with the same vaccine. \n \n- Booster dose \n \nLong-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Twinrix Adult are available up to 20 \nyears after vaccination (see section 5.1). The anti-HBs and anti-HAV antibody titres observed \nfollowing a primary vaccination course with the combined vaccine are in the range of what is seen \nfollowing vaccination with the monovalent vaccines. General guidelines for booster vaccination can \ntherefore be drawn from experience with the monovalent vaccines.  \n \nHepatitis B \n \nThe need for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals who have received a full \nprimary vaccination course has not been established; however some official vaccination programmes \ncurrently include a recommendation for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and these should be \nrespected. \n \nFor some categories of subjects or patients exposed to HBV (e.g; haemodialysis or \nimmunocompromised patients) a precautionary attitude should be considered to ensure a protective \nantibody level ≥ 10IU/l. \n \nHepatitis A \n \nIt is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis \nA vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be \nensured by immunological memory. Guidelines for boosting are based on the assumption that \nantibodies are required for protection. \n \nIn situations where a booster dose of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B are desired, Twinrix Adult can \nbe given. Alternatively, subjects primed with Twinrix Adult may be administered a booster dose of \neither of the monovalent vaccines. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nTwinrix Adult is for intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid region. \n \nExceptionally the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or \nbleeding disorders. However, this route of administration may result in suboptimal immune response \nto the vaccine (see section 4.4). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or neomycin. \n \nHypersensitivity after previous administration of hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B vaccines. \n \nThe administration of Twinrix Adult should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe \nfebrile illness. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nSyncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a \npsychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs \nsuch as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It \nis important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nIt is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection at \nthe time of vaccination. It is not known whether Twinrix Adult will prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B \nin such cases. \n \nThe vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis C and hepatitis E and \nother pathogens known to infect the liver. \n \nTwinrix Adult is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (e.g. needle stick injury). \n \nThe vaccine has not been tested in patients with impaired immunity. In haemodialysis patients and \npersons with an impaired immune system, adequate anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody titres may not be \nobtained after the primary immunisation course and such patients may therefore require administration \nof additional doses of vaccine. \n \nObesity (defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) has been observed to reduce the immune response to hepatitis A \nvaccines. A number of factors have been observed to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B \nvaccines. These factors include older age, male gender, obesity, smoking, route of administration, and \nsome chronic underlying diseases. Consideration should be given to serological testing of those \nsubjects who may be at risk of not achieving seroprotection following a complete course of Twinrix \nAdult. Additional doses may need to be considered for persons who do not respond or have a sub-\noptimal response to a course of vaccinations. \n \nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be \nreadily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n \nSince intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a \nsuboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided. However, exceptionally Twinrix \nAdult can be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders \nsince bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects (see section 4.2). \n \nTwinrix Adult should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. \n \nAs with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees. \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo data on concomitant administration of Twinrix Adult with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or \nhepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated. However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and \nhepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins, no influence on \nseroconversion was observed although it may result in lower antibody titres. \n \nAlthough the concomitant administration of Twinrix Adult and other vaccines has not specifically \nbeen studied, it is anticipated that, if different syringes and other injection sites are used, no interaction \nwill be observed. \n \nIt may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with \nimmunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nThe effect of Twinrix Adult on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development has \nbeen assessed in rats. This study did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to \nfertility, pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition or post-natal development. \n \nThe effect of Twinrix Adult on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development has \nnot been prospectively evaluated in clinical trials. \n \nData on outcomes of a limited number of pregnancies in vaccinated women do not indicate any \nadverse effects of Twinrix Adult on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. While it is \nnot expected that recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen would have adverse effects on \npregnancies or the fetus it is recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after delivery \nunless there is an urgent need to protect the mother against hepatitis B infection. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Twinrix Adult is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of Twinrix \nAdult in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-\nfeeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Twinrix Adult should be made taking into account the \nbenefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Twinrix Adult therapy to the woman. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nTwinrix Adult has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety profile presented below is based on a pooled analysis of events per dose from more than \n6,000 subjects who received either the standard 0, 1, 6 month schedule (n=5,683) or the accelerated 0, \n7, 21 days schedule (n=320). The most commonly reported adverse reactions following Twinrix Adult \nadministration with the standard 0, 1, 6 month schedule are pain and redness occurring in a per dose \nfrequency of 37.6% and 17.0% respectively. \n \nIn the two clinical trials in which Twinrix Adult was administered at 0, 7, 21 days, overall solicited \ngeneral and local symptoms were reported with the same categories of frequency as defined below. \nAfter a fourth dose given at month 12, the incidence of systemic and local adverse reactions was \ncomparable to that seen after vaccination at 0, 7, 21 days. \n \nIn comparative studies, it was noted that the frequency of solicited adverse events following the \nadministration of Twinrix Adult is not different from the frequency of solicited adverse events \nfollowing the administration of the monovalent vaccines. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \nFrequencies are reported as: \nVery common: ≥ 1/10 \nCommon: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 \nUncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 \nRare: ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000 \nVery rare: < 1/10,000 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSystem Organ Class Frequency Adverse reactions \nClinical trials \nInfections and infestations Uncommon Upper respiratory tract infection \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Rare Lymphadenopathy \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Rare Decreased appetite \nNervous system disorders Very common Headache \n\nUncommon Dizziness \nRare Hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia \n\nVascular disorders Rare Hypotension \nGastrointestinal disorders Common Gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhoea, \n\nnausea \nUncommon Vomiting, abdominal pain* \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rare Rash, pruritus \nVery rare Urticaria \n\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nUncommon Myalgia \nRare Arthralgia \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nVery common Pain and redness at the injection site, \nfatigue \n\nCommon Swelling at the injection site, injection \nsite reactions (such as haematoma, \npruritus and bruising), malaise \n\nUncommon Fever (≥ 37.5°C) \nRare Influenza like illness, chills \n\nPost-marketing surveillance \nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with either Twinrix or with GlaxoSmithKline \nmonovalent hepatitis A or B vaccines: \nInfections and infestations Meningitis \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura \nImmune system disorders Anaphylaxis, allergic reactions including anaphylactoid \n\nreactions and mimicking serum sickness \nNervous system disorders Encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuritis, neuropathy, \n\nparalysis, convulsions \nVascular disorders Vasculitis \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Angioneurotic oedema, lichen planus, erythema \n\nmultiforme \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue \ndisorders \n\nArthritis, muscular weakness \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nImmediate injection site pain \n\nFollowing widespread use of the monovalent hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B vaccines, the following \nundesirable events have additionally been reported in temporal association with vaccination:   \nNervous system disorders Multiple sclerosis, myelitis, facial palsy, polyneuritis such \n\nas Guillain-Barré syndrome (with ascending paralysis), \noptic neuritis \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \n\nStinging and burning sensation \n\nInvestigations Abnormal liver function tests \n* refers to adverse reactions observed in clinical trials performed with the paediatric formulation \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \nCases of overdose have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. Adverse events reported \nfollowing overdosage were similar to those reported with normal vaccine administration. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmaco therapeutic group: Hepatitis vaccines, ATC code: J07BC20. \n \nTwinrix Adult is a combined vaccine formulated by pooling bulk preparations of the purified, \ninactivated hepatitis A (HA) virus and purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), separately \nadsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate. The HA virus is propagated in MRC5 \nhuman diploid cells. HBsAg is produced by culture, in a selective medium, of genetically engineered \nyeast cells. \n \nTwinrix Adult confers immunity against HAV and HBV infection by inducing specific anti-HAV and \nanti-HBs antibodies. \n \nProtection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B develops within 2-4 weeks. In the clinical studies, \nspecific humoral antibodies against hepatitis A were observed in approximately 94% of the adults one \nmonth after the first dose and in 100% one month after the third dose (i.e. month 7). Specific humoral \nantibodies against hepatitis B were observed in 70% of the adults after the first dose and \napproximately 99% after the third dose. \n \nThe 0, 7 and 21 day primary schedule plus a fourth dose at month 12 is for use in exceptional \ncircumstances in adults. In a clinical trial where Twinrix Adult was administered according to this \nschedule, 82% and 85% of vaccinees had seroprotective levels of anti-HBV antibodies at 1 and 5 \nweeks respectively following the third dose (i.e. at months 1 and 2 after the initial dose). The \nseroprotection rate against hepatitis B increased to 95.1% by three months after the first dose. \n \nSeropositivity rates for anti-HAV antibodies were 100%, 99.5% and 100% at months 1, 2 and 3 after \nthe initial dose. One month after the fourth dose, all vaccinees demonstrated seroprotective levels of \nanti-HBs antibodies and were seropositive for anti-HAV antibodies. \n \nIn a clinical study conducted in subjects over 40 years of age, the seropositivity rate for anti-HAV \nantibodies and seroprotection rate against hepatitis B of Twinrix Adult following a 0, 1, 6 months \nschedule were compared with the seropositivity and seroprotection rates of monovalent hepatitis A \nand B vaccines when administered in opposite arms. \nThe seroprotection rate against hepatitis B after the administration of Twinrix Adult was 92% and \n56% at 7 and 48 months respectively, versus 80% and 43% after the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals \nmonovalent 20µg hepatitis B vaccine, and 71% and 31% after another licensed monovalent 10µg \nhepatitis B vaccine. Anti-HBs antibody concentrations decreased as age and body mass index \nincreased; they were also lower in male than in female subjects. \nThe seropositivity rate for anti-HAV antibodies after Twinrix Adult was 97% at both 7 and 48 months \nversus 99% and 93% after the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals monovalent hepatitis A vaccine and 99% \nand 97% after another licensed monovalent hepatitis A vaccine. \nSubjects received an additional dose of the same vaccine(s) 48 months after the first dose of the \nprimary vaccination course. One month after this dose, 95% of the subjects vaccinated with Twinrix \nAdult achieved seroprotective levels of anti-HBV antibodies (≥ 10 mIU/ml). \n \nIn two long-term clinical studies conducted in adults aged 17 years to 43 years, respectively 18 and 25 \nsubjects had evaluable tests 20 years after the primary vaccination with Twinrix Adult; the anti-HAV \nseropositivity rates were 100% and 96% respectively and the anti-HBs seroprotection rates were 94% \nand 92%, respectively.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nEvaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on general safety studies. \n \n \n6.

You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Twinrix Adult is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you receive Twinrix Adult \n3. How Twinrix Adult is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Twinrix Adult \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1.   What Twinrix Adult is and what it is used for   \n \nTwinrix Adult is a vaccine used in adults and adolescents 16 years of age and above to prevent two \ndiseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own \nprotection (antibodies) against these diseases. \n \n• Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver.  This disease is caused \n\nby the hepatitis A virus.  The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in food and \ndrink, or by swimming in water contaminated by sewage.  Symptoms of hepatitis A begin 3 to 6 \nweeks after coming into contact with the virus.  These consist of nausea (feeling sick), fever and \naches and pains.  After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become yellowish (jaundice).  \nThe severity and type of symptoms can vary.  Young children may not develop jaundice.  Most \npeople recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to keep people ill for about a \nmonth. \n\n \n• Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.  It causes the liver to become swollen \n\n(inflamed).  The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva \n(spit) of infected people. \n\n \nVaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases. None of the components in the vaccine \nare infectious.  \n \n \n2.  What you need to know before you receive Twinrix Adult  \n \nTwinrix Adult should not be given if \n• you are allergic to: \n\n- the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n- neomycin. \nSigns of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the \nface or tongue. \n\n• you have previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis A and hepatitis B \ndiseases. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n• you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).  A minor infection such as a \ncold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. \n\n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before receiving Twinrix Adult if \n• you have experienced any health problems after previous administration of a vaccine. \n• you have a poor immune system due to illness or drug treatment. \n• you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n \nFainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore \ntell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection. \n \nA poor response to the vaccine, possibly without achieving protection against hepatitis A, has been \nobserved in obese people. A poor response to the vaccine, possibly without achieving protection \nagainst hepatitis B, has also been observed in older people, men rather than women, smokers, obese \npeople, and people with long standing illnesses, or people on some type of drug treatments. Your \ndoctor may advise you to have a blood test after you have completed the course of vaccinations to \ncheck if you have made a satisfactory response. If not, your doctor will advise you on the possible \nneed to have extra doses. \n \nOther medicines and Twinrix Adult  \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. It is not known if Twinrix \nAdult passes into breast milk, however the vaccine is not expected to cause problems in breast-fed \nbabies. \n \nTwinrix Adult contains neomycin \nPlease tell your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic). \n \n \n3. How Twinrix Adult is given   \n \nYou will receive a total of three injections over 6 months. Each injection is given on a separate visit. \nThe first dose will be given on an elected date.  The remaining two doses will be given one month, and \nsix months after the first dose.  \n \n• First dose: at an elected date \n• Second dose: 1 month later \n• Third dose: 6 months after the first dose \n \nTwinrix Adult can also be given as a total of three doses over 1 month.  This schedule may be given to \nadults only needing a rapid protection (e.g. overseas travellers).  The first dose will be given on an \nelected date.  The remaining 2 doses will be given 7 days and 21 days after the first dose.  A fourth \ndose is recommended at 12 months. \n \n• First dose: at an elected date \n• Second dose: 7 days later \n• Third dose: 21 days after the first dose \n• Fourth dose: 12 months after the first dose \n \nYour doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses, and future booster dosing. \n \n\n\n\n21 \n\nAs indicated in section 2, a poor response to the vaccine, possibly without achieving protection against \nhepatitis B, is more common in older people, men rather than women, smokers, obese people, and \npeople with long standing illnesses, or people on some type of drug treatments. Your doctor may \nadvise you to have a blood test after you have completed the course of vaccinations to check if you \nhave made a satisfactory response. If not, your doctor will advise you on the possible need to have \nextra doses. \n \nIf you miss a scheduled injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit. \n \nMake sure you finish the complete vaccination course of three injections.  If not, you may not be fully \nprotected against the diseases. \n \nThe doctor will give Twinrix Adult as an injection into your upper arm muscle.   \n \nThe vaccine should not be given (deep) into the skin or intramuscularly into the buttock because \nprotection may be less. \n \nThe vaccine should never be given into a vein. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \n \n4.  Possible side effects  \n \nLike all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSide effects that may occur are the following: \n \nVery common (These may occur in 1 in 10 doses or more of the vaccine): \n\n• Headache \n• Pain and redness at the injection site \n• Tiredness \n\n \nCommon (These may occur in up to 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine): \n\n• Diarrhoea, nausea \n• Swelling, bruising or itching at the injection site \n• Generally feeling unwell \n\n \nUncommon (These may occur in up to 1 in 100 doses of the vaccine): \n\n• Dizziness \n• Vomiting, stomach pain \n• Aching muscles \n• Upper respiratory tract infection \n• Fever equal to or greater than 37.5°C \n\n \nRare (These may occur in up to 1 in 1,000 doses of the vaccine): \n\n• Swollen glands in the neck armpit or groin (lymphadenopathy) \n• Loss of skin sensitivity to pain or touch (hypoaesthesia) \n• Feeling of pins and needles (paraesthesia) \n• Rash, itching \n• Joint pain \n• Loss of appetite \n• Low blood pressure \n• Flu-like symptoms such as high temperature, sore throat, runny nose, cough and chills \n\n \nVery rare (These may occur in up to 1 in 10,000 doses of the vaccine): \n\n\n\n22 \n\nSide effects occurred very rarely during clinical studies or routine use of the vaccine or with \nindividual hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines include: \n• Reduction in blood platelets, which increases risk of bleeding or bruising \n\n(thrombocytopenia) \n• Purple or red brown spots visible through the skin (thrombocytopenic purpura) \n• Swelling or infection of the brain (encephalitis) \n• Degenerative disease of the brain (encephalopathy) \n• Inflammation of nerves (neuritis) \n• Numbness or weakness of the arms and legs (neuropathy), paralysis \n• Fits or seizures \n• Swelling of the face, mouth or throat (angioneurotic oedema) \n• Purple or reddish-purple bumps on the skin (lichen planus), serious skin rashes (erythema \n\nmultiforme), hives \n• Joint swelling, muscular weakness \n• Infection around the brain which may give severe headache with stiff neck and sensitivity to \n\nlight (meningitis) \n• Inflammation of some blood vessels (vasculitis) \n• Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions and mimicking serum \n\nsickness). Signs of serious allergic reactions may be rashes that may be itchy or blistering, \nswelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood \npressure and loss of consciousness. Such reactions may occur before leaving the doctor’s \nsurgery. However, if you get any of these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. \n\n• Abnormal laboratory liver test results \n• Multiple sclerosis, swelling of the spinal cord (myelitis) \n• Drooping eyelid and sagging muscles on one side of the face (facial palsy) \n• A temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness and paralysis in the \n\nextremities and often progressing to the chest and face (Guillain-Barré syndrome) \n• A disease of the nerves of the eye (optic neuritis) \n• Immediate injection site pain, stinging and burning feeling \n\n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine.  \n \n \n5.  How to store Twinrix Adult  \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton.  The expiry date refers to \nthe last day of that month. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).  \nStore in the original package in order to protect from light. \nDo not freeze.  Freezing destroys the vaccine. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use.
