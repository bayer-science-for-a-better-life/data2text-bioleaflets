This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nZejula 100 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach hard capsule contains niraparib tosylate monohydrate equivalent to 100 mg niraparib. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach hard capsule contains 254.5 mg of lactose monohydrate (see section 4.4). \n \nEach hard capsule shell also contains the colouring agent tartrazine (E 102) [0.0172 mg]. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule (capsule). \n \nHard capsule of approximately 22 mm \u00d7 8 mm; white body with \u201c100 mg\u201d printed in black ink and \npurple cap with \u201cNiraparib\u201d printed in white ink. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nZejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with \nplatinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal \ncancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with Zejula should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of \nanticancer medicinal products. \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose is three 100 mg hard capsules once daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg. \n \nPatients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. Bedtime \nadministration may be a potential method for managing nausea. \n \nIt is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression. \n \nMissing dose \nIf patients miss a dose, they should take their next dose at its regularly scheduled time. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDose adjustments for adverse reactions \nRecommendations for the management of adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. In general, it is \nrecommended to first interrupt the treatment (but no longer than 28 consecutive days) to allow the \npatient to recover from the adverse reaction and then restart at the same dose. In the case that the \nadverse reaction recurs, it is recommended to reduce the dose. If adverse reactions persist beyond a \n28-day dose interruption, it is recommended that Zejula be discontinued. If adverse reactions are not \nmanageable with this strategy of dose interruption and reduction, it is recommended that Zejula be \ndiscontinued. \n \nDose reductions may be implemented based on adverse reactions. The recommended dose reductions \nare first from three hard capsules daily (300 mg) to two hard capsules daily (200 mg). If further dose \nreduction is needed, a second dose reduction from two hard capsules daily (200 mg) to one capsule \ndaily (100 mg) may be implemented. \n \nThe recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Tables 1 and 2. \n \n\nTable 1: Dose modifications for non-haematologic adverse reactions \nNon-haematologic CTCAE* \u2265 Grade 3 treatment-related \nadverse reaction where prophylaxis is not considered \nfeasible or adverse reaction persists despite treatment \n\nFirst occurrence: \n\u2022 Withhold Zejula for a maximum of \n\n28 days or until resolution of \nadverse reaction. \n\n\u2022 Resume Zejula at a reduced dose \n(200 mg/day). \n\nSecond occurrence: \n\u2022 Withhold Zejula for a maximum of \n\n28 days or until resolution of \nadverse reaction. \n\n\u2022 Resume Zejula at a reduced dose \n(100 mg/day). \n\nCTCAE \u2265 Grade 3 treatment-related adverse reaction \nlasting more than 28 days while patient is administered \nZejula 100 mg/day \n\nDiscontinue treatment. \n\n*CTCAE=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \n \n\nTable 2: Dose modifications for haematologic adverse reactions \nHaematologic adverse reactions have been observed during the treatment with Zejula especially \nduring the initial phase of the treatment. It is therefore recommended to monitor complete blood \ncounts (CBCs) weekly during the first month of treatment and modify the dose as needed. After the \nfirst month, it is recommended to monitor CBCs monthly and periodically after this time (see \nsection 4.4). Based on individual laboratory values, weekly monitoring for the second month may \nbe warranted. \n\nHaematologic adverse reaction \nrequiring transfusion or \nhaematopoietic growth factor \nsupport \n\n\u2022 For patients with platelet count \u2264 10,000/\u03bcL, platelet \ntransfusion should be considered. If there are other risk \nfactors for bleeding such as co-administration of \nanticoagulation or antiplatelet medicinal products, \nconsider interrupting these substances and/or \ntransfusion at a higher platelet count. \n\n\u2022 Resume Zejula at a reduced dose. \n\nPlatelet count < 100,000/\u03bcL  \n\nFirst occurrence: \n\u2022 Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor \n\nblood counts weekly until platelet counts return to \n\u2265 100,000/\u00b5L. \n\n\u2022 Resume Zejula at same or reduced dose based on \nclinical evaluation. \n\n\u2022 If platelet count is < 75,000/\u03bcL at any time, resume at a \nreduced dose.  \n\n\n\n4 \n\nTable 2: Dose modifications for haematologic adverse reactions \nSecond occurrence: \n\u2022 Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor \n\nblood counts weekly until platelet counts return \nto \u2265 100,000/\u00b5L. \n\n\u2022 Resume Zejula at a reduced dose. \n\u2022 Discontinue Zejula if the platelet count has not returned \n\nto acceptable levels within 28 days of the dose \ninterruption period, or if the patient has already \nundergone dose reduction to 100 mg QD. \n\nNeutrophil < 1,000/\u00b5L or \nHaemoglobin < 8 g/dL \n\n\u2022 Withhold Zejula for a maximum of 28 days and monitor \nblood counts weekly until neutrophil counts return \nto \u2265 1,500/\u00b5L or haemoglobin returns to \u2265 9 g/dL. \n\n\u2022 Resume Zejula at a reduced dose. \n\u2022 Discontinue Zejula if neutrophils and/or haemoglobin \n\nhave not returned to acceptable levels within 28 days of \nthe dose interruption period, or if the patient has already \nundergone dose reduction to 100 mg QD. \n\nConfirmed diagnosis of \nmyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) \nor acute myeloid leukaemia \n(AML) \n\n\u2022 Permanently discontinue Zejula. \n\n \nPatients with low body weight \nApproximately 25 % of patients in the NOVA study weighed less than 58 kg, and approximately 25 % \nof patients weighed more than 77 kg. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 ADRs was greater among low \nbody weight patients (78 %) than high body weight patients (53 %). Only 13 % of low body weight \npatients remained at a dose of 300 mg beyond Cycle 3. A starting dose of 200 mg for patients \nweighing less than 58 kg may be considered. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (\u2265 65 years). There are limited clinical data in \npatients aged 75 or over. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. There are no \ndata in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis; use \nwith caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data \nin patients with severe hepatic impairment; use with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \n \nPatients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4 \nClinical data are not available in patients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of niraparib in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nOral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be chewed or \ncrushed. \n \nZejula can be taken without regard to meals. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions \n \nIn the NOVA study, patients eligible for Zejula therapy had the following baseline haematologic \nparameters: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,500 cells/\u00b5L; platelets \u2265 100,000 cells/\u00b5L and \nhaemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL prior to therapy. Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, \nneutropenia) have been reported in patients treated with Zejula. In the NOVA study, 48 of 367 (13 %) \nof patients experienced bleeding with concurrent thrombocytopenia; all bleeding events concurrent \nwith thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 or 2 in severity except for one event of Grade 3 petechiae and \nhaematoma observed concurrently with a serious adverse event of pancytopenia. Thrombocytopenia \noccurred more commonly in patients whose baseline platelet count was less than 180 \u00d7 109/L. \nApproximately 76 % of patients with lower baseline platelets (< 180 \u00d7 109/L) who received Zejula \nexperienced thrombocytopenia of any grade, and 45 % of the patients experienced Grade 3/4 \nthrombocytopenia. Pancytopenia has been observed in < 1 % of patients receiving niraparib. If a \npatient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity including pancytopenia that does not resolve \nwithin 28 days following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. \n \nTesting complete blood counts weekly for the first month, followed by monthly monitoring for the \nnext 10 months of treatment and periodically after this time is recommended to monitor for clinically \nsignificant changes in any haematologic parameter during treatment (see section 4.2). \n \nIf a patient develops severe persistent haematologic toxicity that does not resolve within 28 days \nfollowing interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. \n \nDue to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the \nthrombocyte count should be used with caution (see section 4.8). \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML), including cases with fatal \noutcome, have been reported in a small number of patients who received Zejula or placebo. In the \npivotal Phase 3 international trial (ENGOT-OV16), the incidence of MDS/AML in patients who \nreceived niraparib (1.4 %) was similar to that in patients who received placebo (1.1 %). Overall, \nMDS/AML has been reported in 7 out of 751 (0.9 %) patients treated with Zejula in clinical studies. \n \nThe duration of Zejula treatment in patients prior to developing MDS/AML varied from 1 month \nto > 2 years. The cases were typical of secondary, cancer therapy-related MDS/AML. All patients had \nreceived multiple platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens and many had also received other \nDNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. Some of the patients had a history of bone marrow dysplasia. \n \nIf MDS and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with Zejula, treatment should be discontinued \nand the patient treated appropriately. \n \nHypertension, including hypertensive crisis \n \nHypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula. Pre-existing \nhypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment. Blood pressure should \nbe monitored at least weekly for two months, monitored monthly afterwards for the first year and \nperiodically thereafter during treatment with Zejula. Home blood pressure monitoring may be \n\n\n\n6 \n\nconsidered for appropriate patients with instruction to contact their health care provider in case of rise \nin blood pressure. \n \nHypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive medicinal products as well as \nadjustment of the Zejula dose (see section 4.2), if necessary. In the clinical programme, blood pressure \nmeasurements were obtained on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle while the patient remained on Zejula. In \nmost cases, hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment with or \nwithout Zejula dose adjustment (see section 4.2). Zejula should be discontinued in case of \nhypertensive crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with \nantihypertensive therapy. \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \n \nThere have been reports of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) in patients \nreceiving Zejula (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present \nwith rapidly evolving symptoms including seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual \ndisturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES \nrequires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n \nIn case of PRES, it is recommended to discontinue Zejula and to treat specific symptoms including \nhypertension. The safety of reinitiating Zejula therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not \nknown. \n \nPregnancy/contraception \n \nZejula should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not willing to use \nreliable contraception during therapy and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of Zejula (see \nsection 4.6). A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential prior to \ntreatment. \n \nLactose \n \nZejula hard capsules contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \nintolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \nmedicine. \n \nTartrazine (E 102) \n \nThis medicinal product contains tartrazine (E 102), which may cause allergic reactions. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nPharmacodynamic interactions \n \nThe combination of niraparib with vaccines or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. \n \nThe data on niraparib in combination with cytotoxic medicinal products are limited. Therefore, caution \nshould be taken if niraparib is used in combination with vaccines, immunosuppressant agents or with \nother cytotoxic medicinal products. \n \nPharmacokinetic interactions \n \nEffect of other medicinal products on niraparib \n \nNiraparib as a substrate of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) \nNiraparib is a substrate of carboxylesterases (CEs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in vivo. \nOxidative metabolism of niraparib is minimal in vivo. No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when \n\n\n\n7 \n\nadministered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit (e.g. itraconazole, ritonavir, and \nclarithromycin) or induce CYP enzymes (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin). \n \nNiraparib as a substrate of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, and MATE1/2) \nNiraparib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). \nHowever, due to its high permeability and bioavailability, the risk of clinically relevant interactions \nwith medicinal products that inhibit these transporters is unlikely. Therefore, no dose adjustment for \nZejula is required when administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit P-gp \n(e.g. amiodarone, verapamil) or BCRP (e.g. osimertinib, velpatasvir, and eltrombopag). \n \nNiraparib is not a substrate of bile salt export pump (BSEP), or multidrug resistance-associated protein \n2 (MRP2). The major primary metabolite M1 is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, or MRP2. \nNiraparib is not a substrate of multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-1 or 2, while M1 is a substrate \nof both. \n \nNiraparib as a substrate of hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1) \nNeither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate of organic anion transport polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), 1B3 \n(OATP1B3), or organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1). No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when \nadministered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit OATP1B1 or 1B3 (e.g. \ngemfibrozil, ritonavir), or OCT1 (e.g. dolutegravir) uptake transporters. \n \nNiraparib as a substrate of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2) \nNeither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 3 (OAT3), and organic \ncation transporter 2 (OCT2). No dose adjustment for Zejula is required when administered \nconcomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit OAT1 (e.g. probenecid) or OAT3 (e.g. \nprobenecid, diclofenac), or OCT2 (e.g. cimetidine, quinidine) uptake transporters. \n \nEffect of niraparib on other medicinal products  \n \nInhibition of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) \nNeither niraparib nor M1 is an inhibitor of any active substance-metabolising CYP enzymes, namely \nCYP1A1/2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. \n \nEven though inhibition of CYP3A4 in the liver is not expected, the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 at the \nintestinal level has not been established at relevant niraparib concentrations. Therefore, caution is \nrecommended when niraparib is combined with active substances the metabolism of which is \nCYP3A4-dependent and, notably, those having a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. ciclosporin, \ntacrolimus, alfentanil, ergotamine, pimozide, quetiapine, and halofantrine). \n \nInhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)  \nNiraparib did not exhibit inhibitory effect against the UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A9, \nand UGT2B7) up to 200 \u00b5M in vitro. Therefore, the potential for a clinically relevant inhibition of \nUGTs by niraparib is minimal. \n \nInduction of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) \nNeither niraparib nor M1 is a CYP3A4 inducer in vitro. In vitro, niraparib weakly induces CYP1A2 at \nhigh concentrations and the clinical relevance of this effect would not be completely ruled out. M1 is \nnot a CYP1A2 inducer. Therefore, caution is recommended when niraparib is combined with active \nsubstances the metabolism of which is CYP1A2-dependent and, notably, those having a narrow \ntherapeutic range (e.g. clozapine, theophylline, and ropinirole). \n \nInhibition of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, and MATE1/2) \nNiraparib is not an inhibitor of BSEP or MRP2. In vitro, niraparib inhibits P-gp very weakly and \nBCRP with an IC50 = 161 \u00b5M and 5.8 \u00b5M, respectively. Therefore, a clinically meaningful interaction \nrelated to an inhibition of these efflux transporters although unlikely, cannot be excluded. Caution is \nthen recommended when niraparib is combined with substrates of BCRP (irinotecan, rosuvastatin, \nsimvastatin, atorvastatin, and methotrexate). \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \nNiraparib is an inhibitor of MATE1 and -2 with IC50 of 0.18 \u00b5M and \u2264 0.14 \u00b5M, respectively. \nIncreased plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of these \ntransporters (e.g. metformin) cannot be excluded. \n \nThe major primary metabolite M1 does not appear to be an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2 or \nMATE1/2. \n \nInhibition of hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1) \nNeither niraparib nor M1 is an inhibitor of organic anion transport polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) or \n1B3 (OATP1B3). \n \nIn vitro, niraparib weakly inhibits the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) with an IC50 = 34.4 \u00b5M. \nCaution is recommended when niraparib is combined with active substances that undergo an uptake \ntransport by OCT1 such as metformin. \n \nInhibition of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2) \nNeither niraparib nor M1 inhibits organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 3 (OAT3), and organic cation \ntransporter 2 (OCT2). \n \nAll clinical studies have only been performed in adults. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/contraception in females \n \nWomen of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while on treatment and should not be \npregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed on all women of \nchildbearing potential prior to treatment. Women of childbearing potential must use effective \ncontraception during therapy and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of Zejula. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of niraparib in pregnant women. Animal \nreproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted. However, based on its \nmechanism of action, niraparib could cause embryonic or foetal harm, including embryo-lethal and \nteratogenic effects, when administered to a pregnant woman. Zejula should not be used during \npregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding  \n \nIt is unknown whether niraparib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Breast-feeding is \ncontraindicated during administration of Zejula and for 1 month after receiving the last dose (see \nsection 4.3). \n \nFertility \n \nThere are no clinical data on fertility. A reversible reduction of spermatogenesis was observed in rats \nand dogs (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n \nZejula has moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients who take Zejula may \nexperience asthenia, fatigue and dizziness. Patients who experience these symptoms should observe \ncaution when driving or using machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nIn the pivotal ENGOT-OV16 study, adverse reactions (ADRs) occurring \u2265 10 % of patients receiving \nZejula monotherapy were nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue/asthenia, anaemia, constipation, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, neutropenia, insomnia, headache, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, \ndiarrhoea, dyspnea, hypertension, dyspepsia, back pain, dizziness, cough, urinary tract infection, \narthralgia, palpitations, and dysgeusia. \n \nThe most common serious adverse reactions > 1 % (treatment-emergent frequencies) were \nthrombocytopenia and anaemia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe following adverse reactions have been identified in the ENGOT-OV16 study in patients receiving \nZejula monotherapy (see Table 3).  \n \nFrequencies of occurrence of undesirable effects are defined as: very common (\u2265 1/10); common \n(\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); and very rare \n(< 1/10,000).

This is not limited to pivotal ENGOT-OV16 monotherapy \nstudy. \n\u2020 Includes hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid reaction, drug eruption, angioedema, \nand urticaria. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nHaematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) including clinical \ndiagnoses and/or laboratory findings generally occurred early during niraparib treatment with the \nincidence decreasing over time. \n \nThrombocytopenia \nApproximately 60 % of patients receiving Zejula experienced thrombocytopenia of any grade, and \n34 % of patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. In patients with baseline platelet count less \nthan 180 \u00d7 109/L, thrombocytopenia of any grade and Grade 3/4 occurred in 76 % and 45 % of the \n\n\n\n11 \n\npatients, respectively. The median time to onset of thrombocytopenia regardless of grade and \nGrade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 22 and 23 days, respectively. The rate of new incidences of \nthrombocytopenia after intensive dose modifications were performed during the first two months of \ntreatment from Cycle 4 was 1.2 %. The median duration of thrombocytopenia events of any grade was \n23 days, and the median duration of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 10 days. Patients treated with \nZejula who develop thrombocytopenia might have an increased risk of haemorrhage. In the clinical \nprogramme, thrombocytopenia was managed with laboratory monitoring, dose modification and \nplatelet transfusion where appropriate (see section 4.2). Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia \nevents (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) occurred in approximately 3 % of the patients. \n \nAnaemia \nApproximately 50 % of patients experienced anaemia of any grade, and 25 % experienced Grade 3/4 \nanaemia. The median time to onset of anaemia of any grade was 42 days, and 85 days for Grade 3/4 \nevents. The median duration of anaemia of any grade was 63 days, and 8 days for Grade 3/4 events. \nAnaemia of any grade might persist during Zejula treatment. In the clinical programme, anaemia was \nmanaged with laboratory monitoring, dose modification (see section 4.2), and where appropriate with \nred blood cell transfusions. Discontinuation due to anaemia occurred in 1 % of patients. \n \nNeutropenia \nApproximately 30 % of patients receiving Zejula experienced neutropenia of any grade, and 20 % of \npatients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia. The median time to onset of neutropenia of any grade was \n27 days, and 29 days for Grade 3/4 events. The median duration of neutropenia of any grade was \n26 days, and 13 days for Grade 3/4 events. In the clinical programme, neutropenia was managed with \nlaboratory monitoring and dose modifications (see section 4.2). In addition, Granulocyte-Colony \nStimulating Factor (G-CSF) was administered to approximately 6 % of patients treated with niraparib \nas concomitant therapy for neutropenia. Discontinuation due to neutropenia events occurred in 2 % of \npatients. \n \nHypertension \nHypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with Zejula therapy. Hypertension of \nany grade occurred in 19.3 % of patients treated with Zejula. Grade 3/4 hypertension occurred in \n8.2 % of patients. In the clinical programme, hypertension was readily managed with anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products. Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in < 1 % of patients. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been conducted in paediatric patients. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere is no specific treatment in the event of Zejula overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not \nestablished. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and \nshould treat symptomatically. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX54. \n \nMechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n12 \n\n \nNiraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, \nwhich play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may \ninvolve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes \nresulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was \nobserved in tumour cell lines with or without deficiencies in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) 1 and 2 \ntumour suppressor genes. In orthotopic high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft \ntumours (PDX) grown in mice, niraparib has been shown to reduce tumour growth in BRCA 1 and 2 \nmutant, BRCA wild-type but homologous recombination (HR) deficient, and in tumours that are BRCA \nwild-type and without detectable HR deficiency. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nThe safety and efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy was studied in a Phase 3 randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled international trial (ENGOT-OV16 / NOVA) in patients with relapsed \npredominantly high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who \nwere platinum sensitive, defined by complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for more than six \nmonths to their penultimate (next to last) platinum-based therapy. To be eligible for niraparib \ntreatment, the patient should be in response (CR or PR) following completion of last platinum based \nchemotherapy. The CA-125 levels should be normal (or a > 90 % decrease in CA-125 from baseline) \nfollowing their last platinum treatment, and be stable for at least 7 days. Patients could not have \nreceived prior PARP inhibitor therapy, including Zejula. Eligible patients were assigned to one of two \ncohorts based on the results of a germline BRCA mutation test. Within each cohort, patients were \nrandomised using a 2:1 allocation of niraparib and placebo. Patients were assigned to the gBRCAmut \ncohort based on blood samples for gBRCA analysis that were taken prior to randomisation. Testing for \ntBRCA mutation and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was performed using the HRD \ntest on tumour tissue obtained at the time of initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence. \nRandomisation within each cohort was stratified by time to progression after the penultimate platinum \ntherapy before study enrollment (6 to < 12 months and \u2265 12 months); use or not of bevacizumab in \nconjunction with the penultimate or last platinum regimen; and best response during the most recent \nplatinum regimen (complete response and partial response).  \n \nPatients began treatment on Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1) with niraparib 300 mg or matched placebo \nadministered QD in continuous 28-day cycles. Clinic visits occurred each cycle (4 weeks \u00b1 3 days). \n \nIn the NOVA study, 48 % of patients had a dose interruption in Cycle 1. Approximately 47 % of \npatients restarted at a reduced dose in Cycle 2. \n \nThe most commonly used dose in niraparib-treated patients in the NOVA study was 200 mg. \n \nProgression-free survival was determined per RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, \nversion 1.1) or clinical signs and symptoms and increased CA-125. PFS was measured from the time \nof randomisation (which occurred up to 8 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy regimen) to \ndisease progression or death. \n \nThe primary efficacy analysis for PFS was determined by blinded central independent assessment and \nwas prospectively defined and assessed for the gBRCAmut cohort and the non-gBRCAmut cohort \nseparately. \n \nSecondary efficacy endpoints included chemotherapy-free interval (CFI), time to first subsequent \ntherapy (TFST), PFS after the first subsequent therapy (PFS2), time to second subsequent therapy \n(TSST) and OS (overall survival). \n \nDemographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior treatment history were generally well \nbalanced between the niraparib and placebo arms in the gBRCAmut (n = 203) and the non-gBRCAmut \ncohorts (n = 350). Median ages ranged from 57 to 63 years across treatments and cohorts. The primary \ntumour site in most patients (> 80 %) within each cohort was the ovary; most patients (> 84 %) had \n\n\n\n13 \n\ntumours with serous histology. A high proportion of patients in both treatment arms in both cohorts \nhad received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy, including 49 % and 34 % of niraparib patients in \nthe gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut cohorts, respectively. Most patients were age 18 to 64 years \n(78 %), Caucasian (86 %) and had an ECOG performance status of 0 (68 %). \n \nIn the gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher in the niraparib arm than \nthe placebo arm (14 and 7 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib group continued \ntreatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (54.4 % and 16.9 % \nrespectively). \n \nIn the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher in the \nniraparib arm than in the placebo arm (8 and 5 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib \ngroup continued treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (34.2 % and \n21.1 %, respectively). \n \nThe study met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved PFS for niraparib \nmaintenance monotherapy compared with placebo in the gBRCAmut cohort (HR 0.27; 95 % CI* \n0.173, 0.410; p < 0.0001) as well as in the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort (HR 0.45; 95 % CI* 0.338, \n0.607; p < 0.0001). Table 4 shows the results for the PFS primary endpoint for the primary efficacy \npopulations (gBRCAmut cohort and the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort). A sensitivity analysis of \ninvestigator PFS showed the following results for the gBRCAmut cohort: HR 0.27 (95 % CI*, 0.182, \n0.401; p < 0.0001); median PFS 14.8 months (95% CI*, 12.0, 16.6) for niraparib and median PFS 5.5 \nmonths (95% CI*, 4.9, 7.2) for placebo, and for the non-gBRCAmut cohort: HR 0.53 (95 % CI*, \n0.405, 0.683; p < 0.0001); median PFS 8.7 months (95 % CI*, 7.3, 10.0) for niraparib and median \nPFS 4.3 months (95% CI*, 3.7, 5.5) for placebo. \n \nTable 4: Summary of primary objective outcomes in the ENGOT-OV16 study  \n\ngBRCAmut cohort Non-gBRCAmut cohort \n\nniraparib \n(N = 138) \n\nplacebo \n(N = 65) \n\nniraparib \n(N = 234) \n\nplacebo \n(N = 116) \n\nPFS median (95% CI*) 21.0 \n(12.9, NR) \n\n5.5 \n(3.8, 7.2) \n\n9.3 \n(7.2, 11.2) \n\n3.9 \n(3.7, 5.5) \n\np-value < 0.0001 < 0.0001 \n\nHazard ratio (HR) \n(Nir:plac) (95 % CI*) \n\n0.27 \n(0.173, 0.410) \n\n0.45 \n(0.338, 0.607) \n\n* CI denotes confidence interval. \n \nPrior to unblinding of the study, tumours of patients were tested for the presence of HRD using an \nexperimental HRD test, which evaluates three indirect measures of tumour genome instability: loss of \nheterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions. In the HRDpos \ngroup, the hazard ratio was 0.38 (95 % CI, 0.243, 0.586; p < 0.0001). In the HRDneg group, the \nhazard ratio was 0.58 (95 % CI, 0.361, 0.922; p = 0.0226). The experimental test was not able to \ndiscriminate which patients would or would not benefit from niraparib maintenance therapy. \n \nFigure 1: Kaplan-Meier plot for progression-free survival in the gBRCAmut cohort based on \n\n\n\n14 \n\nIRC assessment (ITT population, N = 203) \n \n\n \n \nFigure 2: Kaplan-Meier plot for progression-free survival in the non-gBRCAmut cohort \n\noverall based on IRC assessment (ITT population, N = 350) \n \n\n \n \nThe secondary endpoints CFI, TFST, and PFS2 demonstrated a statistically significant and persistent \ntreatment effect in favour of the niraparib treatment arm in the gBRCAmut cohort and the overall \nnon-gBRCAmut cohort (Table 5).  \n \nTable 5: Secondary endpoints* \n\nHR (95% CI) 0.27 (0.173,0.410)\n\nEs\ntim\n\nat\ned\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl F\nun\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nTime since Randomization (Months)\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\nHR (95% CI) 0.27 (0.173,0.410)\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nEs\ntim\n\nat\ned\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl F\nun\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nTime since Randomization (Months)\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\nTreatment\n\n       A: Niraparib B: Placebo\n\n138 125 107 98 89 79 63 44 28 26 16 3 1\n\n65 52 34 21 12 8 6 2 2 2 1 1 0\n\nHR (95% CI) 0.45 (0.338,0.607)\n\nEs\ntim\n\nat\ned\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl F\nun\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nTime since Randomization (Months)\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\nHR (95% CI) 0.45 (0.338,0.607)\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nEs\ntim\n\nat\ned\n\n S\nur\n\nvi\nva\n\nl F\nun\n\nct\nio\n\nn\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nTime since Randomization (Months)\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\nTreatment\n\n       A: Niraparib B: Placebo\n\n234 188 145 113 88 75 57 41 23 21 16 7 3\n\n116 88 52 33 23 19 10 8 4 4 3 1 1\n\n\n\n15 \n\n gBRCAmut non-gBRCAmut \n Zejula Placebo Zejula Placebo \nEndpoint N = 138 N = 65 N = 234 N = 116 \nChemotherapy-free interval \n \nMedian (95 % CI) \u2013 mo 22.8 \n\n(17.9-NR) \n9.4 \n\n(7.9-10.6) \n12.7 \n\n(11.0-14.7) \n8.6 \n\n(6.9-10.0) \n     \nP value < 0.001 < 0.001 \n     \nHazard ratio (95 % CI) 0.26 (0.17-0.41) 0.50 (0.37-0.67) \nTime to first subsequent treatment \n \nMedian (95 % CI) \u2013 mo 21.0 \n\n(17.5-NR) \n8.4 \n\n(6.6-10.6) \n11.8 \n\n(9.7-13.1) \n7.2 \n\n(5.7-8.5) \n     \nP value < 0.001 < 0.001 \n     \nHazard ratio (95 % CI) 0.31 (0.21-0.48) 0.55 (0.41-0.72) \nProgression-free survival 2 \n \nMedian (95 % CI) \u2013 mo 25.8 \n\n(20.3-NR) \n19.5 \n\n(13.3-NR) \n18.6 \n\n(16.2-21.7) \n15.6 \n\n(13.2-20.9) \n     \nP value 0.006 0.03 \n     \nHazard ratio (95 % CI) 0.48 (0.28-0.82) 0.69 (0.49-0.96) \n\n*CI denotes confidence interval, gBRCAmut germline BRCA mutation, and NR not reached \n \nPatient-reported outcome (PRO) data from validated survey tools (FOSI and EQ-5D) indicate that \nniraparib-treated patients reported no difference from placebo in measures associated with quality of \nlife (QoL). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Zejula \nin all subsets of the paediatric population in ovarian carcinoma (excluding rhabdomyosarcoma and \ngerm cell tumours). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \n \nFollowing a single-dose administration of 300 mg niraparib under fasting conditions, niraparib was \nmeasurable in plasma within 30 minutes and the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for niraparib \nwas reached in about 3 hours [804 ng/mL (% CV:50.2 %)]. Following multiple oral doses of niraparib \nfrom 30 mg to 400 mg once daily, accumulation of niraparib was approximately 2 to 3 folds. \n \nThe systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to niraparib increased in a dose-proportional manner when \nthe dose of niraparib increased from 30 mg to 400 mg. The absolute bioavailability of niraparib is \napproximately 73 %, indicating minimal first pass effect. \n \nA concomitant high-fat meal did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of niraparib after \nadministration of 300 mg of niraparib. \n \nDistribution \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nNiraparib was moderately protein bound in human plasma (83.0 %), mainly with serum albumin. In a \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib, the Vd/F was 1,074 L in cancer patients, indicating \nextensive tissue distribution of niraparib. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nNiraparib is metabolised primarily by carboxylesterases (CEs) to form a major inactive metabolite, \nM1. In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 (the subsequently formed M1 glucuronides) were the major \ncirculating metabolites. \n \nElimination \n \nFollowing a single oral 300-mg dose of niraparib, the mean terminal half-life (t\u00bd) of niraparib ranged \nfrom 48 to 51 hours (approximately 2 days). In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent \ntotal clearance (CL/F) of niraparib was 16.2 L/h in cancer patients. \n \nNiraparib is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary and renal routes. Following an oral \nadministration of a single 300-mg dose of [14C]-niraparib, on average 86.2 % (range 71 % to 91 %) of \nthe dose was recovered in urine and feces over 21 days. Radioactive recovery in the urine accounted \nfor 47.5 % (range 33.4 % to 60.2 %) and in the feces for 38.8 % (range 28.3 % to 47.0 %) of the dose. \nIn pooled samples collected over 6 days, 40.0 % of the dose was recovered in the urine primarily as \nmetabolites and 31.6 % of the dose was recovered in the feces primarily as unchanged niraparib. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies in patients, pre-existing mild \n(CLCr < 90 - \u2265 60 ml/min) and moderate (CLCr < 60 - \u2265 30 mL/min) renal impairment did not \ninfluence the clearance of niraparib. No patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment or \nend-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis were identified in clinical studies (see section 4.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nIn the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from clinical studies in patients, pre-existing mild \nand moderate hepatic impairment did not influence the clearance of niraparib. The pharmacokinetics \nof niraparib have not been assessed in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). \n \nAge, weight and race \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that age, weight and race had no significant impact on \nthe pharmacokinetics of niraparib. \n \nPaediatric population \nNo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of niraparib in paediatric patients. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nSafety pharmacology \n \nIn vitro, niraparib inhibited the dopamine transporter DAT at concentration levels below human \nexposure levels. In mice, single doses of niraparib increased intracellular levels of dopamine and \nmetabolites in cortex. Reduced locomotor activity was seen in one of two single dose studies in mice. \nThe clinical relevance of these findings is not known. No effect on behavioural and/or neurological \nparameters have been observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs at estimated CNS \nexposure levels similar to or below expected therapeutic exposure levels.  \n \nRepeat-dose toxicity \n \nDecreased spermatogenesis was observed in rats and dogs at exposure levels below those seen \n\n\n\n17 \n\nclinically and was largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing. \n \nGenotoxicity \n \nNiraparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) test but was clastogenic in \nan in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration assay and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus \nassay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary \npharmacology of niraparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans. \n \nReproductive toxicology \n \nReproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with niraparib. \n \nCarcinogenicity \n \nCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with niraparib. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nZejula 100 mg hard capsules \nniraparib \n\n \nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Zejula is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Zejula  \n3. How to take Zejula \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Zejula \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Zejula is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Zejula is and how it works \nZejula contains the active substance niraparib. Niraparib is a type of anti-cancer medicine called a \nPARP inhibitor. PARP inhibitors block an enzyme called poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] \npolymerase (PARP). PARP helps cells repair damaged DNA so blocking it means that the DNA of \ncancer cells cannot be repaired. This results in tumour cell death, helping to control the cancer. \n \nWhat Zejula is used for \nZejula is used in adult women for the treatment of cancer of the ovary, the fallopian tubes (part of the \nfemale reproductive system that connects the ovaries to the uterus), or the peritoneum (the membrane \nlining the abdomen). It is used after the cancer has responded to previous treatment with standard \nplatinum-based chemotherapy. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Zejula \n \nDo not take Zejula \n\u2022 if you are allergic to niraparib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\u2022 if you are breast-feeding. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before or while taking this medicine if any of the following \ncould apply to you: \n \nLow blood-cell counts \nZejula lowers your blood-cell counts, such as your red blood-cell count (anaemia), white blood-cell \ncount (neutropenia), or blood-platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Signs and symptoms you need to \n\n\n\n29 \n\nlook out for include fever or infection, and abnormal bruising or bleeding (see section 4 for more \ninformation). Your doctor will test your blood regularly throughout your treatment. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia \nRarely, low blood-cell counts may be a sign of more serious problems with the bone marrow such as \n\u2018myelodysplastic syndrome\u2019 (MDS) or \u2018acute myeloid leukaemia\u2019 (AML). Your doctor may want to \ntest your bone marrow to check for these problems. \n \nHigh blood pressure \nZejula can cause high blood pressure, which in some cases, could be severe. Your doctor will measure \nyour blood pressure regularly throughout your treatment. He or she may also give you medicine to \ntreat high blood pressure and adjust your Zejula dose, if necessary. Your doctor may advise home \nblood pressure monitoring and instruction on when to contact him or her in case of a rise in blood \npressure. \n \nPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) \nA rare neurological side effect named Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) has \nbeen associated with Zejula treatment. If you have headache, vision changes, confusion or seizure with \nor without high blood pressure, please contact your doctor. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nChildren under 18 years of age should not be given Zejula. This medicine has not been studied in this \nage group. \n \nOther medicines and Zejula \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nPregnancy \nZejula should not be taken during pregnancy as it could harm your baby. If you are pregnant, think \nyou may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this \nmedicine. \n \nIf you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use reliable contraception while you are \ntaking Zejula, and you must continue to use reliable contraception for 1 month after taking your last \ndose. Your doctor will ask you to confirm that you are not pregnant with a pregnancy test before \nstarting your treatment. Contact your doctor straightaway if you become pregnant while you are taking \nZejula. \n \nBreast-feeding \nZejula should not be taken if you are breast-feeding as it is not known if it passes into breast milk. If \nyou are breast-feeding, you must stop before you start taking Zejula and you must not begin \nbreast-feeding again until 1 month after taking your last dose. Ask your doctor for advice before \ntaking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nWhen you are taking Zejula it may make you feel weak, tired or dizzy and therefore influence your \nability to drive and use machines. Observe caution when driving or using machines. \n \nZejula contains lactose \nIf you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor \nbefore taking this medicine. \n \nZejula contains tartrazine (E 102) \nIt may cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n3. How to take Zejula \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nThe recommended starting dose is 3 capsules taken together once a day (total daily dose of 300 mg), \nwith or without food. Take Zejula at approximately the same time each day. Taking Zejula at bedtime \nmay help you to manage nausea. \n \nSwallow the capsules whole, with some water. Do not chew or crush the capsules. \n \nYour doctor may recommend a lower dose if you experience side effects (such as nausea, tiredness, \nabnormal bleeding/bruising, anaemia). \n \nYour doctor will check you on a regular basis, and you will normally continue to take Zejula as long \nas you experience benefit, and do not suffer unacceptable side effects. \n \nIf you take more Zejula than you should \nIf you take more than your normal dose, contact your doctor immediately. \n \nIf you forget to take Zejula \nDo not take an additional dose if you miss a dose or vomit after taking Zejula. Take your next dose at \nits scheduled time.

you experience side effects (such as nausea, tiredness, abnormal bleeding/bruising, anaemia). your doctor will check you on a regular basis, and you will normally continue to take zejula as long as you experience benefit, and do not suffer unacceptable side effects. if you take more zejula than you should if you take more than your normal dose, contact your doctor immediately. if you forget to take zejula do not take an additional dose if you miss a dose or vomit after taking zejula. take your next dose at its scheduled time. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "zejula", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0},
