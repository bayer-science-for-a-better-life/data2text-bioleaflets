CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nDeferasirox Accord is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood \ntransfusions (\u22657 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged \n6 years and older. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood \ntransfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient \ngroups: \n- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood \n\ntransfusions (\u22657 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, \n- in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to \n\ninfrequent blood transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and \nolder, \n\n- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation \ntherapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-\ndependent thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment with deferasirox should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the \ntreatment of chronic iron overload. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is only available as film-coated tablets. \nAll references to the dispersible tablet formulation throughout the SmPC refer to the reference \nmedical product dispersible tablets. \n \nPosology \n \nTransfusional iron overload \n \nIt is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about \n100 ml/kg) of packed red blood cells (PRBC) or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that \nchronic iron overload is present (e.g. serum ferritin >1,000 \u00b5g/l). Doses (in mg/kg) must be calculated \nand rounded to the nearest whole tablet size. \n \nThe goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, \nas required, to reduce the existing iron burden. \n \nCaution should be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients \n(see section 4.4). \n \nDeferasirox film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the deferasirox \ndispersible tablet formulation (see section 5.2). In case of switching from dispersible tablets to film-\ncoated tablets, the dose of the film-coated tablets should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible \ntablets, rounded to the nearest whole tablet. \n \nTable 1 Recommended doses for transfusional iron overload \n \n Film-coated tablets Transfusions Serum ferritin \nStarting dose 14 mg/kg/day After 20 units \n\n(about 100 ml/kg) \nof PRBC \n\nor >1,000 \u00b5g/l \n\nAlternative \nstarting doses \n\n21 mg/kg/day >14 ml/kg/month \nof PRBC (approx. \n>4 units/month for \nan adult) \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n7 mg/kg/day <7 ml/kg/month \nof PRBC (approx. \n<2 units/month for \nan adult) \n\n \n\nFor patients well \nmanaged on \ndeferoxamine \n\nOne third of deferoxamine dose   \n\nMonitoring  Monthly \nTarget range  500-1,000 \u00b5g/l \nAdjustment step \n(every \n3-6 month) \n\nIncrease  \n \n\n>2,500 \u00b5g/l \n3.5-7 mg/kg/day \nUp to 28 mg/kg/day \n\nDecrease  <2,500 \u00b5g/l \n3.5-7 mg/kg/day \nIn patients treated with doses  \n>21 mg/kg/day \n-When target is reached 500-1,000 \u00b5g/l  \n\nMaximum dose 28 mg/kg/day   \n\nConsider \ninterruption \n\n <500 \u00b5g/l \n\n \nStarting dose \nThe recommended initial daily dose of deferasirox film-coated tablets is 14 mg/kg body weight. \n \nAn initial daily dose of 21 mg/kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated \nbody iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n(approximately >4 units/month for an adult). \n \nAn initial daily dose of 7 mg/kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body \niron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells \n(approximately <2 units/month for an adult). The patient\u2019s response must be monitored and a dose \nincrease should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n \nFor patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of deferasirox \nfilm-coated tablets that is numerically one third that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered \n(e.g. a patient receiving 40 mg/kg/day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be \ntransferred to a starting daily dose of 14 mg/kg/day of deferasirox film-coated tablets). When this \nresults in a daily dose less than 14 mg/kg body weight, the patient\u2019s response must be monitored and a \ndose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1). \n  \nDose adjustment \nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of deferasirox be \nadjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin. Dose adjustments \nmay be made in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient\u2019s response and \ntherapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden). In patients not adequately controlled with \ndoses of 21 mg/kg (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently above 2,500 \u00b5g/l and not showing a \ndecreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg/kg may be considered. The availability of long-term \nefficacy and safety data from clinical studies conducted with deferasirox dispersible tablets used at \ndoses above 30 mg/kg is currently limited (264 patients followed for an average of 1 year after dose \nescalation). If only very poor haemosiderosis control is achieved at doses up to 21 mg/kg, a further \nincrease (to a maximum of 28 mg/kg) may not achieve satisfactory control, and alternative treatment \noptions may be considered. If no satisfactory control is achieved at doses above 21 mg/kg, treatment at \nsuch doses should not be maintained and alternative treatment options should be considered whenever \n\n\n\n5 \n\npossible. Doses above 28 mg/kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with \ndoses above this level (see section 5.1). \n \nIn patients treated with doses greater than 21 mg/kg, dose reductions in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should \nbe considered when control has been achieved (e.g. serum ferritin levels persistently below 2,500 \u00b5g/l \nand showing a decreasing trend over time). In patients whose serum ferritin level has reached the \ntarget (usually between 500 and 1,000 \u00b5g/l), dose reductions in steps of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should be \nconsidered to maintain serum ferritin levels within the target range and to minimise the risk of \noverchelation. If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 \u00b5g/l, an interruption of treatment should \nbe considered (see section 4.4). \n \nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n \nChelation therapy should only be initiated when there is evidence of iron overload (liver iron \nconcentration [LIC] \u22655 mg Fe/g dry weight [dw] or serum ferritin consistently >800 \u00b5g/l). LIC is the \npreferred method of iron overload determination and should be used wherever available. Caution \nshould be taken during chelation therapy to minimise the risk of overchelation in all patients (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nDeferasirox film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the deferasirox \ndispersible tablet formulation (see section 5.2). In case of switching from dispersible tablets to film-\ncoated tablets, the dose of the film-coated tablets should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible \ntablets, rounded to the nearest whole tablet. \n \nTable 2 Recommended doses for non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n \n Film-coated tablets Liver iron \n\nconcentration \n(LIC)* \n\nSerum ferritin \n\nStarting dose 7 mg/kg/day \u22655 mg Fe/g dw or >800 \u00b5g/l \nMonitoring  Monthly \nAdjustment steps \n(every 3-\n6 months) \n\nIncrease \n\u22657 mg Fe/g dw >2,000 \u00b5g/l 3.5-7 mg/kg/day \n\nDecrease <7 mg Fe/g dw \u22642,000 \u00b5g/l 3.5-7 mg/kg/day \nMaximum dose 14 mg/kg/day   \n\n7 mg/kg/day   \nFor adults \n\nFor paediatric patients not assessed and \u22642,000 \u00b5g/l \n\nInterruption  <3 mg Fe/g dw or <300 \u00b5g/l \n\nRetreatment  Not recommended \n \n* LIC is the preferred method of iron overload determination. \n \nStarting dose \nThe recommended initial daily dose of deferasirox film-coated tablets in patients with non-transfusion-\ndependent thalassaemia syndromes is 7 mg/kg body weight. \n \nDose adjustment \nIt is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month to assess the patient\u2019s response to \ntherapy and to minimise the risk of overchelation (see section 4.4). After every 3 to 6 months of \ntreatment, a dose increase in increments of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg should be considered if the patient\u2019s LIC is \n\u22657 mg Fe/g dw, or if serum ferritin is consistently >2,000 \u00b5g/l and not showing a downward trend, and \nthe patient is tolerating the medicinal product well. Doses above 14 mg/kg are not recommended \n\n\n\n6 \n\nbecause there is no experience with doses above this level in patients with non-transfusion-dependent \nthalassaemia syndromes. \n \nIn patients in whom LIC was not assessed and serum ferritin is \u22642,000 \u00b5g/l, dosing should not exceed \n7 mg/kg. \n \nFor patients in whom the dose was increased to >7 mg/kg, dose reduction to 7 mg/kg or less is \nrecommended when LIC is <7 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin is \u22642,000 \u00b5g/l. \n \nTreatment cessation \nOnce a satisfactory body iron level has been achieved (LIC <3 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin \n<300 \u00b5g/l), treatment should be stopped. There are no data available on the retreatment of patients \nwho reaccumulate iron after having achieved a satisfactory body iron level and therefore retreatment \ncannot be recommended. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly (\u226565 years of age) \nThe dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above. In clinical studies, \nelderly patients experienced a higher frequency of adverse reactions than younger patients (in \nparticular, diarrhoea) and should be monitored closely for adverse reactions that may require a dose \nadjustment. \n \nRenal impairment \nDeferasirox has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients \nwith estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nDeferasirox is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the dose should be considerably \nreduced followed by progressive increase up to a limit of 50% (see sections 4.4 and 5.2), and \ndeferasirox must be used with caution in such patients. Hepatic function in all patients should be \nmonitored before treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and then every month (see section \n4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \n \nTransfusional iron overload: \nThe dosing recommendations for paediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years with transfusional iron \noverload are the same as for adult patients (see section 4.2). It is recommended that serum ferritin be \nmonitored every month to assess the patient\u2019s response to therapy and to minimise the risk of \noverchelation (see section 4.4). Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into \naccount when calculating the dose. \n \nIn children with transfusional iron overload aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in \nadults (see section 5.2). This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in \nadults. However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration. \n \nNon-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes: \nIn paediatric patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, dosing should not \nexceed 7 mg/kg. In these patients, closer monitoring of LIC and serum ferritin is essential to avoid \noverchelation (see section 4.4). In addition to monthly serum ferritin assessments, LIC should be \nmonitored every three months when serum ferritin is \u2264800 \u00b5g/l. \n \nChildren from birth to 23 months: \nThe safety and efficacy of deferasirox in children from birth to 23 months of age have not been \nestablished. No data are available. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \nMethod of administration \n  \nFor oral use. \n \nThe film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. For patients who are unable to \nswallow whole tablets, the film-coated tablets may be crushed and administered by sprinkling the full \ndose onto soft food, e.g. yogurt or apple sauce (pureed apple). The dose should be immediately and \ncompletely consumed, and not stored for future use. \n \nThe film-coated tablets should be taken once a day, preferably at the same time each day, and may be \ntaken on an empty stomach or with a light meal (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  \n \nCombination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been \nestablished (see section 4.5). \n \nPatients with estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nRenal function \n \nDeferasirox has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the age-appropriate \nnormal range. \n \nDuring clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine of >33% on \u22652 consecutive occasions, sometimes \nabove the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients. These were dose-\ndependent. About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% \nlevel without dose adjustment. In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always \nrespond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption. In some cases, only a stabilisation of the serum \ncreatinine values has been observed after dose reduction. Cases of acute renal failure have been reported \nfollowing post-marketing use of deferasirox (see section 4.8). In some post-marketing cases, renal \nfunction deterioration has led to renal failure requiring temporary or permanent dialysis. \n \nThe causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated. Particular attention should \ntherefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving \nmedicinal products that depress renal function, and in patients who are receiving high doses of \ndeferasirox and/or low rates of transfusion (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells or \n<2 units/month for an adult). While no increase in renal adverse reactions as observed after dose \nescalation of deferasirox dispersible tablets to doses above 30 mg/kg in clinical studies, an increased \nrisk of renal adverse reactions with film-coated tablet doses above 21 mg/kg cannot be excluded. \n \nIt is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy. Serum \ncreatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and \nwith the Schwartz formula in children) and/or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored prior to \ntherapy, weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with deferasirox \n(including switch of formulation), and monthly thereafter. Patients with pre-existing renal \nconditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more \nat risk of complications. Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis occurring during treatment with \ndeferasirox. The majority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi \n\n\n\n8 \n\nsyndrome) or diarrhoea, or conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication. Acid-base \nbalance should be monitored as clinically indicated in these populations. Interruption of deferasirox \ntherapy should be considered in patients who develop metabolic acidosis. \n \nPost-marketing cases of severe forms of renal tubulopathy (such as Fanconi syndrome) and renal failure \nassociated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy have \nbeen reported in patients treated with deferasirox, mainly in children. It is recommended that \nhyperammonaemic encephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who \ndevelop unexplained changes in mental status while on deferasirox therapy. \n \nTable 3 Dose adjustment and interruption of treatment for renal monitoring \n \n\n Serum creatinine  Creatinine clearance \nBefore initiation of \ntherapy \n\nTwice (2x) and Once (1x) \n\nContraindicated   <60 ml/min \nMonitoring \n- First month after \n\nstart of therapy or \ndose modification \n(including switch \nof formulation) \n\n- Thereafter \n\n \nWeekly \n\n \n \n \n \n \nMonthly \n\n \nand \n\n \n \n \n \n \nand \n\n \nWeekly \n\n \n \n \n \n \nMonthly \n\nReduction of daily dose by 7 mg/kg/day (film-coated tablet formulation), \nif following renal parameters are observed at two consecutive visits and cannot be attributed to \nother causes \nAdult patients \n\n \nPaediatric patients \n\n>33% above pre- \ntreatment average \n> age appropriate ULN** \n\nand \n \nand/or \n\nDecreases <LLN* (<90 ml/min) \n \nDecreases <LLN* (<90 ml/min) \n\nAfter dose reduction, interrupt treatment, if \nAdult and paediatric Remains >33% above \n\npre-treatment average \nand/or Decreases <LLN* (<90 ml/min) \n\n*LLN: lower limit of the normal range \n**ULN: upper limit of the normal range \n\n \nTreatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances. \n \nDose reduction or interruption may be also considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of renal \ntubular function and/or as clinically indicated: \n\n\u2022 Proteinuria (test should be performed prior to therapy and monthly thereafter) \n\u2022 Glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, \n\nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria (monitor as needed). \n\u2022 Renal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia \n\ntreated with deferasirox. \n \nPatients should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal \nbiopsy) may be considered if the following occur despite dose reduction and interruption: \n\n\u2022 Serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and \n\u2022 Persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e.g. proteinuria, Fanconi \n\nSyndrome). \n \nHepatic function \n \nLiver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with deferasirox. Post-marketing \ncases of hepatic failure, some of which were fatal, have been reported. Severe forms associated with \nchanges in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, may occur in patients \n\n\n\n9 \n\ntreated with deferasirox, particularly in children. It is recommended that hyperammonaemic \nencephalopathy be considered and ammonia levels measured in patients who develop unexplained \nchanges in mental status while on deferasirox therapy. Care should be taken to maintain adequate \nhydration in patients who experience volume-depleting events (such as diarrhoea or vomiting), \nparticularly in children with acute illness. Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with \nsignificant morbidities including pre-existing liver cirrhosis. However, the role of deferasirox as a \ncontributing or aggravating factor cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \n \nIt is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the \ninitiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter. If there is a persistent \nand progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other causes, \ndeferasirox should be interrupted. Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has been \nclarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose followed by \ngradual dose escalation may be considered.  \n \nDeferasirox is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see \nsection 5.2). \n \nTable 4 Summary of safety monitoring recommendations \n \n\nTest Frequency \nSerum creatinine In duplicate prior to therapy. \n\nWeekly during first month of therapy or \nafter dose modification (including switch of \nformulation). \nMonthly thereafter. \n\nCreatinine clearance and/or plasma \ncystatin C \n\nPrior to therapy. \nWeekly during first month of therapy or \nafter dose modification (including switch of \nformulation). \nMonthly thereafter. \n\nProteinuria Prior to therapy. \nMonthly thereafter. \n\nOther markers of renal tubular function \n(such as glycosuria in non-diabetics and \nlow levels of serum potassium, \nphosphate, magnesium or urate, \nphosphaturia, aminoaciduria) \n\nAs needed. \n\nSerum transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline \nphosphatase \n\nPrior to therapy. \nEvery 2 weeks during first month of \ntherapy. \nMonthly thereafter. \n\nAuditory and ophthalmic testing Prior to therapy. \nAnnually thereafter. \n\nBody weight, height and sexual \ndevelopment \n\nPrior to therapy. \nAnnually in paediatric patients. \n\n \n\n \nIn patients with a short life expectancy (e.g. high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes), especially when \nco-morbidities could increase the risk of adverse reactions, the benefit of deferasirox might be limited \nand may be inferior to risks. As a consequence, treatment with deferasirox is not recommended in \nthese patients. \n \nCaution should be used in elderly patients due to a higher frequency of adverse reactions (in \nparticular, diarrhoea). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nData in children with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia are very limited (see section 5.1). As a \nconsequence, deferasirox therapy should be closely monitored to detect adverse reactions and to \nfollow iron burden in the paediatric population. In addition, before treating heavily iron-overloaded \nchildren with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia with deferasirox, the physician should be \naware that the consequences of long-term exposure in such patients are currently not known. \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nUpper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children \nand adolescents, receiving deferasirox. Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see \nsection 4.8). There have been reports of ulcers complicated with digestive perforation. Also, there \nhave been reports of fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhages, especially in elderly patients who had \nhaematological malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Physicians and patients should remain alert \nfor signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during deferasirox therapy \nand promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious gastrointestinal adverse \nreaction is suspected. Caution should be exercised in patients who are taking deferasirox in \ncombination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs, \ncorticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates, in patients receiving anticoagulants and in patients with \nplatelet counts below 50,000/mm3 (50 x 109/l) (see section 4.5). \n \nSkin disorders \n \nSkin rashes may appear during deferasirox treatment. The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases. \nWhen interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of \nthe rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation. In severe cases this reintroduction \ncould be conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration. Severe \ncutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which could \nbe life- threatening or fatal, have been reported. If any SCAR is suspected, deferasirox should be \ndiscontinued immediately and should not be reintroduced. At the time of prescription, patients should \nbe advised of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and be closely monitored. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nCases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported \nin patients receiving deferasirox, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases \nwithin the first month of treatment (see section 4.8). If such reactions occur, deferasirox should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted. Deferasirox should not be reintroduced \nin patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction due to the risk of anaphylactic shock \n(see section 4.3). \n \nVision and hearing \n \nAuditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see \nsection 4.8). Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the \nstart of treatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months). If disturbances are noted \nduring the treatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered. \n \nBlood disorders \n \nThere have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia (or \naggravation of these cytopenias) and of aggravated anaemia in patients treated with deferasirox. \nMost of these patients had pre-existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with \nbone marrow failure. However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded. Interruption \nof treatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia. \n \nOther considerations \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nMonthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient\u2019s response to \ntherapy and to avoid overchelation (see section 4.2). Dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and \nhepatic function, and serum ferritin levels are recommended during periods of treatments with high \ndoses and when serum ferritin levels are close to the target range. If serum ferritin falls consistently \nbelow 500 \u00b5g/l (in transfusional iron overload) or below 300 \u00b5g/l (in non-transfusion-dependent \nthalassaemia syndromes), an interruption of treatment should be considered. \n \nThe results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should \nbe recorded and regularly assessed for trends. \n \nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.8). However, as a general precautionary measure in \nthe management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and \nsexual development should be monitored prior to therapy and at regular intervals (every 12 months). \n \nCardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload. Cardiac function should be \nmonitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with deferasirox. \n \nExcipients \n \nDeferasirox Accord contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \nDeferasirox Accord contains castor oil. This medicinal product may cause stomach upset and diarrhea. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe safety of deferasirox in combination with other iron chelators has not been established. \nTherefore, it must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3). \n \nInteraction with food \n \nThe Cmax of deferasirox film-coated tablets was increased (by 29%) when taken with a high-fat meal. \nDeferasirox film-coated tablets may be taken either on an empty stomach or with a light meal, \npreferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nAgents that may decrease deferasirox systemic exposure \n \nDeferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes. In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant \nadministration of deferasirox (single dose of 30 mg/kg, dispersible tablet formulation) and the \npotent UGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox \nexposure by 44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). Therefore, the concomitant use of deferasirox with potent \nUGT inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a \ndecrease in deferasirox efficacy. The patient\u2019s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after \nthe combination, and the dose of deferasirox adjusted if necessary. \n \nCholestyramine significantly reduced the deferasirox exposure in a mechanistic study to determine \nthe degree of enterohepatic recycling (see section 5.2). \n \nInteraction with midazolam and other agents metabolised by CYP3A4 \n \nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox dispersible tablets and \nmidazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% \n\n\n\n12 \n\nCI: 8% - 26%). In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced. Therefore, due to a \npossible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with \nsubstances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e.g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive \nagents, bepridil, ergotamine). \n \nInteraction with repaglinide and other agents metabolised by CYP2C8 \n \nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate \nCYP2C8 inhibitor (30 mg/kg daily, dispersible tablet formulation), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 \nsubstrate, given as a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 2.3-fold \n(90% CI [2.03-2.63]) and 1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]), respectively. Since the interaction has \nnot been established with doses higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of \ndeferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided. If the combination appears necessary, careful \nclinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4). An interaction \nbetween deferasirox and other CYP2C8 substrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded. \n \nInteraction with theophylline and other agents metabolised by CYP1A2 \n \nIn a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a CYP1A2 inhibitor \n(repeated dose of 30 mg/kg/day, dispersible tablet formulation) and the CYP1A2 substrate \ntheophylline (single dose of 120 mg) resulted in an increase of theophylline AUC by 84% (90% CI: \n73% to 95%). The single dose Cmax was not affected, but an increase of theophylline Cmax is \nexpected to occur with chronic dosing. Therefore, the concomitant use of deferasirox with \ntheophylline is not recommended. If deferasirox and theophylline are used concomitantly, \nmonitoring of theophylline concentration and theophylline dose reduction should be considered. An \ninteraction between deferasirox and other CYP1A2 substrates cannot be excluded. For substances \nthat are predominantly metabolised by CYP1A2 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. \nclozapine, tizanidine), the same recommendations apply as for theophylline. \n \nOther information \n \nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not \nbeen formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not \nrecommended to take deferasirox tablets with aluminium-containing antacid preparations. \n \nThe concomitant administration of deferasirox with substances that have known ulcerogenic \npotential, such as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral \nbisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4). The concomitant \nadministration of deferasirox with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage. Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these \nsubstances. \n \nConcomitant administration of deferasirox and busulfan resulted in an increase of busulfan exposure \n(AUC), but the mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. If possible, evaluation of the \npharmacokinetics (AUC, clearance) of a busulfan test dose should be performed to allow dose \nadjustment. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nNo clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox. Studies in animals have shown \nsome reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. \n \nAs a precaution, it is recommended that Deferasirox Accord is not used during pregnancy unless \nclearly necessary. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nDeferasirox Accord may decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5). Women of \nchildbearing potential are recommended to use additional or alternative non-hormonal methods of \ncontraception when using Deferasirox Accord. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIn animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk. No \neffect on the offspring was noted. It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk. \nBreast-feeding while taking Deferasirox Accord is not recommended. \n \nFertility \n \nNo fertility data is available for humans. In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility \nwere found (see section 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nDeferasirox Accord has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients \nexperiencing the uncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or \noperating machines (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment in clinical studies conducted with \ndeferasirox dispersible tablets in adult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances \n(mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain) and skin rash. Diarrhoea is reported more \ncommonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years and in the elderly. These reactions are \ndose-dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is \ncontinued. \n \nDuring clinical studies dose-dependent increases in serum creatinine occurred in about 36% of \npatients, though most remained within the normal range. Decreases in mean creatinine clearance have \nbeen observed in both paediatric and adult patients with beta-thalassemia and iron overload during \nthe first year of treatment, but there is evidence that this does not decrease further in subsequent \nyears of treatment. Elevations of liver transaminases have been reported. Safety monitoring schedules \nfor renal and liver parameters are recommended. Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens \nopacities) disturbances are uncommon, and yearly examinations are also recommended (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic \nepidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nhave been reported with the use of deferasirox (see section 4.4). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare \n(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency \ngrouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 5: Adverse reactions \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n\nNot known: Pancytopenia1, thrombocytopenia1, anaemia \n\n\n\n14 \n\naggravated1, neutropenia1 \nImmune system disorders \n\nNot known: Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reactions \nand angioedema)1 \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nNot known: Metabolic acidosis1 \n\nPsychiatric disorders \nUncommon: Anxiety, sleep disorder \n\nNervous system disorders \nCommon: Headache \nUncommon: Dizziness \n\nEye disorders \nUncommon: Cataract, maculopathy \nRare: Optic neuritis \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nUncommon: Deafness \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nUncommon: Laryngeal pain \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \nCommon: Diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, nausea, abdominal \n\npain, abdominal distension, dyspepsia \nUncommon: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastric ulcer (including \n\nmultiple ulcers), duodenal ulcer, gastritis \nRare: Oesophagitis \nNot known: Gastrointestinal perforation1, acute pancreatitis1 \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \nCommon: Transaminases increased \nUncommon: Hepatitis, cholelithiasis  \nNot known: Hepatic failure1,2 \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  \nCommon: Rash, pruritus  \nUncommon: Pigmentation disorder \nRare: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) \nNot known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome1, hypersensitivity vasculitis1, urticaria1, \n\nerythema multiforme1, alopecia1, toxic epidermal necrolysis \n(TEN)1 \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \nVery common: Blood creatinine increased \nCommon: Proteinuria \nUncommon: Renal tubular disorder2 (acquired Fanconi syndrome), \n\nglycosuria  \nNot known: Acute renal failure1,2, tubulointerstitial nephritis1, \n\nnephrolithiasis1, renal tubular necrosis1 \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nUncommon: Pyrexia, oedema, fatigue \n \n\n1 Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience. These are derived from \nspontaneous reports for which it is not always possible to reliably establish frequency or a \ncausal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product. \n\n2 Severe forms associated with changes in consciousness in the context of hyperammonaemic \nencephalopathy have been reported. \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nGallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients. Elevations of liver \ntransaminases were reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of patients. Elevations of transaminases \n\n\n\n15 \n\ngreater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon \n(0.3%). During post-marketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with \nthe deferasirox dispersible tablet formulation, especially in patients with pre-existing liver cirrhosis \n(see section 4.4). There have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis. The majority of these \npatients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi syndrome) or diarrhoea, or conditions \nwhere acid-base imbalance is a known complication (see section 4.4). Cases of serious acute \npancreatitis were observed without documented underlying biliary conditions. As with other iron \nchelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been \nuncommonly observed in patients treated with deferasirox (see section 4.4). \n \nCreatinine clearance in transfusional iron overload \n \nIn a retrospective meta-analysis of 2,102 adult and paediatric beta-thalassaemia patients with \ntransfusional iron overload treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets in two randomised and four \nopen label studies of up to five years\u2019 duration, a mean creatinine clearance decrease of 13.2% in \nadult patients (95% CI: -14.4% to -12.1%; n=935) and 9.9% (95% CI: -11.1% to -8.6%; n=1,142) in \npaediatric patients was observed during the first year of treatment. In 250 patients who were \nfollowed for up to five years, no further decrease in mean creatinine clearance levels was observed. \n \nClinical study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes \n \nIn a 1-year study in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron \noverload (dispersible tablets at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day), diarrhoea (9.1%), rash (9.1%), and nausea \n(7.3%) were the most frequent study drug-related adverse reactions. Abnormal serum creatinine and \ncreatinine clearance values were reported in 5.5% and 1.8% of patients, respectively. Elevations of \nliver transaminases greater than 2 times the baseline and 5 times the upper limit of normal were \nreported in 1.8% of patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nIn two clinical studies, growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with deferasirox \nfor up to 5 years were not affected (see section 4.4). \nDiarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients. \nRenal tubulopathy has been mainly reported in children and adolescents with beta-thalassaemia treated \nwith deferasirox. In post-marketing reports, a high proportion of cases of metabolic acidosis occurred in \nchildren in the context of Fanconi syndrome. \n \nAcute pancreatitis has been reported, particularly in children and adolescents. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nEarly signs of acute overdose are digestive effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and \nvomiting. Hepatic and renal disorders have been reported, including cases of liver enzyme and \ncreatinine increased with recovery after treatment discontinuation. An erroneously administered single \ndose of 90 mg/kg led to Fanconi syndrome which resolved after treatment. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for deferasirox. Standard procedures for management of overdose may be \nindicated as well as symptomatic treatment, as medically appropriate. \n \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Iron chelating agents, ATC code: V03AC03  \n \nMechanism of action \n \nDeferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III). It is a tridentate ligand that \nbinds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the \nfaeces. Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels \nof these metals. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, deferasirox at daily \ndoses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (dispersible tablet formulation) induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, \n0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight/day, respectively. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical efficacy studies were conducted with deferasirox dispersible tablets. \n \nDeferasirox has been investigated in 411 adult (age \u226516 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to \n<16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions. Of the paediatric patients 52 were \naged 2 to 5 years. The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle \ncell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes, \nDiamond-Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias). \n \nDaily treatment with the deferasirox dispersible tablet formulation at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg for one \nyear in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in \nindicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/g liver \n(biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 and -\n926 \u00b5g/l on average, respectively. At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake were \n1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively. Deferasirox \ninduced similar responses in iron-overloaded patients with other anaemias. Daily doses of 10 mg/kg \n(dispersible tablet formulation) for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin levels and \ninduce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange transfusions. Serum \nferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron concentration indicating that \ntrends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy. Limited clinical data (29 patients \nwith normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that treatment with deferasirox 10-\n30 mg/kg/day (dispersible tablet formulation) for 1 year may also reduce levels of iron in the heart (on \naverage, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds). \n \nThe principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from beta-\nthalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of deferasirox \ndispersible tablets to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population. It appeared from a \npost-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration \u22657 mg \nFe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (20 and 30 mg/kg) or deferoxamine (35 to \n\u226550 mg/kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved. However, in patients with liver iron \nconcentration <7 mg Fe/g dw treated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (5 and 10 mg/kg) or \ndeferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of \nthe two chelators. This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain \non their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose. Fifty-six patients under \nthe age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving deferasirox dispersible \ntablets. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\nIt appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that deferasirox dispersible tablets could be as active \nas deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i.e. a dose of deferasirox dispersible tablets that is \nnumerically half of the deferoxamine dose). For deferasirox film-coated tablets, a dose ratio of 3:1 can \nbe considered (i.e. a dose of deferasirox film-coated tablets that is numerically one third of the \ndeferoxamine dose). However, this dosing recommendation was not prospectively assessed in the \nclinical studies. \n \nIn addition, in patients with liver iron concentration \u22657 mg Fe/g dw with various rare anaemias or \nsickle cell disease, deferasirox dispersible tablets up to 20 and 30 mg/kg produced a decrease in liver \niron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia. \n \nIn a 5-year observational study in which 267 children aged 2 to <6 years (at enrollment) with \ntransfusional haemosiderosis received deferasirox, there were no clinically meaningful differences in \nthe safety and tolerability profile of deferasirox in paediatric patients aged 2 to <6 years compared to \nthe overall adult and older paediatric population, including increases in serum creatinine of >33% and \nabove the upper limit of normal on \u22652 consecutive occasions (3.1%), and elevation of alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (4.3%). Single events of \nincrease in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase were reported in 20.0% and 8.3%, respectively, of the \n145 patients who completed the study. \n \nIn a study to assess the safety of deferasirox film-coated and dispersible tablets, 173 adult and \npaediatric patients with transfusion dependent thalassaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were treated \nfor 24 weeks. A comparable safety profile for film-coated and dispersible tablets was observed. \n \nIn patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes and iron overload, treatment with \ndeferasirox dispersible tablets was assessed in a 1-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nstudy. The study compared the efficacy of two different deferasirox dispersible tablet regimens \n(starting doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, 55 patients in each arm) and of matching placebo (56 patients). \nThe study enrolled 145 adult and 21 paediatric patients. The primary efficacy parameter was the \nchange in liver iron concentration (LIC) from baseline after 12 months of treatment. One of the \nsecondary efficacy parameters was the change in serum ferritin between baseline and fourth quarter. \nAt a starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day, deferasirox dispersible tablets led to reductions in indicators of \ntotal body iron. On average, liver iron concentration decreased by 3.80 mg Fe/g dw in patients treated \nwith deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 0.38 mg Fe/g dw in \npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). On average, serum ferritin decreased by 222.0 \u00b5g/l in patients \ntreated with deferasirox dispersible tablets (starting dose 10 mg/kg/day) and increased by 115 \u00b5g/l in \npatients treated with placebo (p<0.001). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nDeferasirox film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the deferasirox \ndispersible tablet formulation. After adjustment of the strength, the film-coated tablet formulation \n(360 mg strength) was equivalent to deferasirox dispersible tablets (500 mg strength) with respect to \nthe mean area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) under fasting conditions. The Cmax \nwas increased by 30% (90% CI: 20.3% - 40.0%); however a clinical exposure/response analysis \nrevealed no evidence of clinically relevant effects of such an increase. \n \nAbsorption \n \nDeferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is absorbed following oral administration with a median \ntime to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability \n(AUC) of deferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose. \nThe absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablet formulation has not been determined. \nBioavailability of deferasirox film-coated tablets was 36% greater than that with dispersible tablets. \n \nA food-effect study involving administration of the film-coated tablets to healthy volunteers under \nfasting conditions and with a low-fat (fat content <10% of calories) or high-fat (fat content >50% of \n\n\n\n18 \n\ncalories) meal indicated that the AUC and Cmax were slightly decreased after a low-fat meal (by \n11% and 16%, respectively). After a high-fat meal, AUC and Cmax were increased (by 18% and \n29%, respectively). The increases in Cmax due to the change in formulation and due to the effect of a \nhigh-fat meal may be additive and therefore, it is recommended that the film-coated tablets should \nbe taken either on an empty stomach or with a light meal. \n \nDistribution \n \nDeferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and \nhas a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults. \n \nBiotransformation \n \nGlucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. \nDeconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic \nrecycling) is likely to occur: in a healthy volunteer study, the administration of cholestyramine after a \nsingle dose of deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC). \n \nDeferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalysed \n(oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). No inhibition of \ndeferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro. \n \nElimination \n \nDeferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose). Renal \nexcretion of deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose). The mean elimination half-\nlife (t1/2) ranged from 8 to 16 hours. The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the \nbiliary excretion of deferasirox. \n \nLinearity / non-linearity \n \nThe Cmax and AUC0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state \nconditions. Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3. \n \nCharacteristics in patients \nElderly \nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older). \n \nRenal or hepatic impairment \nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. \nThe pharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to \n5 times the upper limit of the normal range. \n \nIn a clinical study using single doses of 20 mg/kg deferasirox dispersible tablets, the average \nexposure was increased by 16% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and \nby 76% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) compared to subjects \nwith normal hepatic function. The average Cmax of deferasirox in subjects with mild or moderate \nhepatic impairment was increased by 22%. Exposure was increased 2.8-fold in one subject with \nsevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). \n \nGender \nFemales have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males. \nSince dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical \nconsequences. \n \nPaediatric population \n\n\n\n19 \n\nThe overall exposure of adolescents (12 to \u226417 years) and children (2 to <12 years) to deferasirox \nafter single and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients. In children younger than 6 years \nold exposure was about 50% lower than in adults. Since dosing is individually adjusted according to \nresponse this is not expected to have clinical consequences. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. The main findings were \nkidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts). Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile \nanimals. The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not \npreviously overloaded with iron. \n \nTests of genotoxicity in vitro were negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) while \ndeferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of non-iron-\nloaded rats at lethal doses. No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats. Deferasirox was not \ncarcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/- heterozygous mice in a \n6-month study. \n \nThe potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits. Deferasirox was not \nteratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high \ndoses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother. Deferasirox did not cause other \neffects on fertility or reproduction. \n \n \n6.

How to take Deferasirox Accord \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Deferasirox Accord \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Deferasirox Accord is and what it is used for \n \nWhat Deferasirox Accord is \nDeferasirox Accord contains an active substance called deferasirox. It is an iron chelator which is a \nmedicine used to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). It traps and \nremoves excess iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. \n \nWhat Deferasirox Accord is used for \nRepeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example \nthalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)). However, repeated blood \ntransfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. This is because blood contains iron and your body \ndoes not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. In patients \nwith non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over time, \nmainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. Over time, the \nexcess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. Medicines called iron chelators \nare used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in \npatients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is \ncontraindicated or inadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by \ninfrequent blood transfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to \n5 years. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat \npatients aged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, \nbut who are not transfusion dependent. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Deferasirox Accord \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \nDo not take Deferasirox Accord \n\u2022 if you are allergic to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). If this applies to you, tell your doctor before taking Deferasirox Accord. If you \nthink you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n\n\u2022 if you have moderate or severe kidney disease. \n\u2022 if you are currently taking any other iron chelator medicines. \n \nDeferasirox Accord is not recommended \n\u2022 if you are at an advanced stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; decreased production of \n\nblood cells by the bone marrow) or have advanced cancer. \n \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Deferasirox Accord: \n\u2022 if you have a kidney or liver problem. \n\u2022 if you have a cardiac problem due to iron overload. \n\u2022 if you notice a marked decrease in your urine output (sign of kidney problem). \n\u2022 if you develop a severe rash, or difficulty breathing and dizziness or swelling mainly of the face \n\nand throat (signs of severe allergic reaction, see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\u2022 if you experience a combination of any of the following symptoms: rash, red skin, blistering of \n\nthe lips, eyes or mouth, skin peeling, high fever, flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes \n(signs of severe skin reaction, see also section 4 \u201cPossible side effects\u201d). \n\n\u2022 if you experience a combination of drowsiness, upper right abdominal pain, yellowing or \nincreased yellowing of your skin or eyes and dark urine (signs of liver problems). \n\n\u2022 if you experience difficulty thinking, remembering information, or solving problems, being less \nalert or aware or feeling very sleepy with low energy (signs of a high level of ammonia in your \nblood, which may be associated with liver or renal problems, see also section 4 \u201cPossible side \neffects\u201d). \n\n\u2022 if you vomit blood and/or have black stools. \n\u2022 if you experience frequent abdominal pain, particularly after eating or taking Deferasirox \n\nAccord. \n\u2022 if you experience frequent heartburn. \n\u2022 if you have a low level of platelets or white blood cells in your blood test. \n\u2022 if you have blurred vision \n\u2022 if you have diarrhoea or vomiting. \n\u2022 If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor straight away. \n \nMonitoring your Deferasirox Accord treatment \nYou will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment. These will monitor the amount of iron in \nyour body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well Deferasirox Accord is working. The tests will also \nmonitor your kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver \nfunction (blood level of transaminases). Your doctor may require you to undergo a kidney biopsy, if \nhe/she suspects significant kidney damage. You may also have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) \ntests to determine the amount of iron in your liver. Your doctor will take these tests into consideration \nwhen deciding on the dose of Deferasirox Accord most suitable for you and will also use these tests to \ndecide when you should stop taking Deferasirox Accord. \n \nYour eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure. \n \nOther medicines and Deferasirox Accord \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines.  \nThis includes in particular: \n\u2022 other iron chelators, which must not be taken with Deferasirox Accord, \n\u2022 antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium, which should not be taken at \n\nthe same time of day as Deferasirox Accord, \n\n\n\n40 \n\n\u2022 ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such \nas rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis), \n\n\u2022 simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol), \n\u2022 certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids), \n\u2022 oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), \n\u2022 anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent or treat blood clotting), \n\u2022 hormonal contraceptive agents (birth control medicines), \n\u2022 bepridil, ergotamine (used for heart problems and migraines), \n\u2022 repaglinide (used to treat diabetes), \n\u2022 rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\u2022 phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy), \n\u2022 ritonavir (used in the treatment of HIV infection), \n\u2022 paclitaxel (used in cancer treatment), \n\u2022 theophylline (used to treat respiratory diseases such as asthma), \n\u2022 clozapine (used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia), \n\u2022 tizanidine (used as a muscle relaxant), \n\u2022 cholestyramine (used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood). \n\u2022 busulfan (used as a treatment prior to transplantation in order to destroy the original bone \n\nmarrow before the transplant). \n \nAdditional tests may be required to monitor the blood levels of some of these medicines. \n \nOlder people (age 65 years and over) \nDeferasirox Accord can be used by people aged 65 years and over at the same dose as for other adults. \nElderly patients may experience more side effects (in particular diarrhoea) than younger patients.

PACKAGE LEAFLET", "Section_1": {"Title": "1. what deferasirox accord is and what it is used for", "Section_Content": "what deferasirox accord is deferasirox accord contains an active substance called deferasirox. it is an iron chelator which is a medicine used to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload). it traps and removes excess iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools. what deferasirox accord is used for repeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example thalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes (mds)). however, repeated blood transfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron. this is because blood contains iron and your body does not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions. in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia syndromes, iron overload may also develop over time, mainly due to increased absorption of dietary iron in response to low blood cell counts. over time, the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart. medicines called iron chelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage. deferasirox accord is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. deferasirox accord is also used to treat chronic iron overload when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by infrequent blood transfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 5 years. deferasirox accord is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate to treat patients aged 10 years or older who have iron overload associated with their thalassaemia syndromes, but who are not transfusion dependent.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "deferasirox
