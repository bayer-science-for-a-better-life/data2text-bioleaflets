NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nXadago 50 mg film-coated tablets \n\nXadago 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nXadago 50 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains safinamide methansulfonate equivalent to 50 mg safinamide.  \n\n \n\nXadago 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nEach film-coated tablet contains safinamide methansulfonate equivalent to 100 mg safinamide. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nFilm-coated tablet (tablet) \n\n \n\nXadago 50 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nOrange to copper, round, biconcave, film-coated tablet of 7 mm diameter with metallic gloss, \n\nembossed with the strength “50” on one side of the tablet. \n\n \n\nXadago 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nOrange to copper, round, biconcave, film-coated tablet of 9 mm diameter with metallic gloss, \n\nembossed with the strength “100” on one side of the tablet. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n\n \n\nXadago is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) as add-\n\non therapy to a stable dose of levodopa (L-dopa) alone or in combination with other PD medicinal \n\nproducts in mid-to late-stage fluctuating patients.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\n \n\nTreatment with safinamide should be started at 50 mg per day. This daily dose may be increased to \n\n100 mg/day on the basis of individual clinical need.  \n\nIf a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. \n\n \n\nElderly \n\nNo change in dose is required for elderly patients. \n\n \n\nExperience of use of safinamide in patients over 75 years of age is limited.  \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nSafinamide use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). No \n\ndose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. The lower dose of 50 mg/day is \n\nrecommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. If patients progress from moderate to \n\nsevere hepatic impairment safinamide should be stopped (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nNo change in dose is required for patients with renal impairment. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe safety and efficacy of safinamide in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been \n\nestablished. No data are available. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nFor oral use. \n\nSafinamide should be taken with water. \n\nSafinamide may be taken with or without food. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1).  \n\nConcomitant treatment with other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nConcomitant treatment with pethidine (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). \n\nUse in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).  \n\nUse in patients with albinism, retinal degeneration, uveitis, inherited retinopathy or severe progressive \n\ndiabetic retinopathy (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nGeneral warning \n\n \n\nIn general, safinamide may be used with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the lowest \n\neffective dose, with caution for serotoninergic symptoms. In particular, the concomitant use of \n\nsafinamide and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided, or if concomitant treatment is necessary \n\nthese medicinal products should be used at low doses (see section 4.5). A washout period \n\ncorresponding to 5 half-lives of the SSRI used previously should be considered prior to initiating \n\ntreatment with safinamide. \n\n \n\nAt least 7 days must elapse between discontinuation of safinamide and initiation of treatment with \n\nMAO inhibitors or pethidine (see section 4.3 and 4.5). \n\n \n\nWhen safinamide is co-administered with products that are BCRP substrates, please refer to the SmPC \n\nfor that particular medicinal product. \n\nHepatic impairment \n\n \n\nCaution should be exercised when initiating treatment with safinamide in patients with moderate \n\nhepatic impairment. In case patients progress from moderate to severe hepatic impairment, treatment \n\nwith  safinamide should be stopped (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).  \n\n \n\nPotential for retinal degeneration in patients with prior history of retinal disease  \n\n \n\nSafinamide should not be administered to patients with ophthalmological history that would put them \n\nat increased risk for potential retinal effects (e.g., family history of hereditary retinal disease, or history \n\nof uveitis) see sections 4.3 and 5.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nImpulse control disorders (ICDs)  \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or dopaminergic \n\ntreatments. Some reports of ICDs have also been observed with other MAO-inhibitors. Safinamide \n\ntreatment has not been associated with any increase in the appearance of ICDs.  \n\n \n\nPatients and carers should be made aware of the behavioural symptoms of ICDs that were observed in \n\npatients treated with MAO-inhibitors, including cases of compulsions, obsessive thoughts, \n\npathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, impulsive behaviour and compulsive \n\nspending or buying. \n\n \n\nDopaminergic side effects \n\n \n\nSafinamide used as an adjunct to levodopa may potentiate the side effects of levodopa, and pre-\n\nexisting dyskinesia may be exacerbated, requiring a decrease of levodopa. This effect was not seen \n\nwhen safinamide was used as an adjunct to dopamine agonists in early stage PD patients. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nIn vivo and in vitro pharmacodynamic drug interactions \n\n \n\nMAO inhibitors and pethidine \n\nSafinamide must not be administered along with other MAO inhibitors (including moclobemide) as \n\nthere may be a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition that may lead to a hypertensive crisis (see \n\nsection 4.3).  \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of pethidine and MAO \n\ninhibitors. As this may be a class-effect, the concomitant administration of safinamide and pethidine is \n\ncontraindicated (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nThere have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of MAO inhibitors \n\nand sympathomimetic medicinal products. In view of the MAO inhibitory activity of safinamide, \n\nconcomitant administration of safinamide and sympathomimetics, such as those present in nasal and \n\noral decongestants or cold medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, requires \n\ncaution (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nDextromethorphan \n\nThere have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of \n\ndextromethorphan and non-selective MAO inhibitors. In view of the MAO inhibitory activity of \n\nsafinamide, the concomitant administration of safinamide and dextromethorphan is not recommended, \n\nor if concomitant treatment is necessary, it should be used with caution (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAntidepressants  \n\nThe concomitant use of safinamide and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.4), \n\nthis precaution is based on the occurrence of serious adverse reactions (e.g. serotonin syndrome), \n\nalthough rare, that have occurred when SSRIs and dextromethorphan have been used with MAO \n\ninhibitors. If necessary, the concomitant use of these medicinal products should be at the lowest \n\neffective dose. A washout period corresponding to 5 half-lives of the SSRI used previously should be \n\nconsidered prior to initiating treatment with safinamide. \n\n \n\nSerious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake \n\ninhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic/tetracyclic \n\nantidepressants and MAO inhibitors (see section 4.4). In view of the selective and reversible MAO-B \n\ninhibitory activity of safinamide, antidepressants may be administered but used at the lowest doses \n\nnecessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nIn vivo and in vitro pharmacokinetic drug interactions \n\n \n\nSafinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP in vitro. In drug-drug-interaction studies in human, a weak \n\ninteraction was observed with rosuvastatin (AUC increase between 1.25 and 2.00 fold) but no \n\nsignificant interaction was found with diclofenac.  \n\nIt is recommended to monitor patients when safinamide is taken with medicinal products that are \n\nBCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, topotecan, \n\ndiclofenac or glyburide) and to refer to their SmPCs to determine if a dose adjustment is needed. \n\n \n\nSafinamide is almost exclusively eliminated via metabolism, largely by high capacity amidases that \n\nhave not yet been characterized. Safinamide is eliminated mainly in the urine. In human liver \n\nmicrosomes (HLM), the N-dealkylation step appears to be catalysed by CYP3A4, as safinamide \n\nclearance in HLM was inhibited by ketoconazole by 90%.  \n\n \n\nSafinamide inhibits OCT1 in vitro at clinically relevant portal vein concentrations. Therefore, caution \n\nis necessary when safinamide is taken concomitantly with medicinal products that are OCT1 substrates \n\nand have a tmax similar to safinamide (2 hours) (e.g. metformin, aciclovir, ganciclovir) as exposure to \n\nthese substrates might be increased as a consequence. \n\n \n\nThe metabolite NW-1153 is a substrate for OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations.  \n\nMedicinal products that are inhibitors of OAT3 given concomitantly with safinamide may reduce \n\nclearance of NW-1153, i.e., and thus may increase its systemic exposure. The systemic exposure of \n\nNW-1153 is low (1/10 of parent safinamide). This potential increase is most likely of no clinical \n\nrelevance as NW-1153, the first product in the metabolic pathway, is further transformed to secondary \n\nand tertiary metabolites.  \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\n \n\nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\n \n\nSafinamide should not be given to women of childbearing potential unless adequate contraception is \n\npracticed.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\n \n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of safinamide in pregnant women. Studies in \n\nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Xadago is not recommended during \n\npregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \n\n \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\n \n\nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of safinamide in milk \n\n(for details see 5.3).  \n\nA risk for the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Xadago should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\n \n\nAnimal studies indicate that safinamide treatment is associated with adverse reactions on female rat \n\nreproductive performance and sperm quality. Male rat fertility is not affected (see section 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nSomnolence and dizziness may occur during safinamide treatment, therefore  patients should be \n\ncautioned about using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain \n\nthat safinamide does not affect them adversely. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\n \n\nDyskinesia was the most common adverse reaction reported in safinamide patients when used in \n\ncombination with L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD treatments.  \n\nSerious adverse reactions are known to occur with the concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, \n\ntricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors, such as hypertensive crisis (high blood \n\npressure, collapse), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (confusion, sweating, muscle rigidity, \n\nhyperthermia, CPK increase), serotonin syndrome (confusion, hypertension, muscle stiffness, \n\nhallucinations), and hypotension. With MAO-inhibitors there have been reports of drug interactions \n\nwith concomitant use of sympathomimetic medicinal products.  \n\n \n\nImpulse control disorders; pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive \n\nspending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine \n\nagonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments.  \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n \n\nThe tabulation below includes all adverse reactions in clinical trials where adverse reactions were \n\nconsidered related. \n\n \n\nAdverse reactions

and did not require reduction of dose in any patient. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\n \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nIn one patient suspected of consuming more than the daily prescribed dose of 100 mg for one month, \n\nsymptoms of confusion, sleepiness, forgetfulness and dilated pupils were reported. These symptoms \n\nresolved on discontinuing the medicinal product, without sequelae. \n\n \n\nThe expected pattern of events or symptoms following intentional or accidental overdose with \n\nSafinamide would be those related to its pharmacodynamic profile: MAO-B inhibition with \n\nactivity-dependent inhibition of Na+ channels. The symptoms of an excessive MAO-B inhibition \n\n(increase in dopamine level) could include hypertension, postural hypotension, hallucinations, \n\nagitation, nausea, vomiting, and dyskinesia.  \n\n \n\nThere is no known antidote to safinamide or any specific treatment for safinamide overdose. If an \n\nimportant overdose occurs, safinamide treatment should be discontinued and supportive treatment \n\nshould be administered as clinically indicated.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson-Drugs, monoamine oxidase -B inhibitors, ATC code: \n\nN04BD03.  \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\n \n\nSafinamide acts through both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms of action. Safinamide \n\nis a highly selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor causing an increase in extracellular levels of \n\ndopamine in the striatum. Safinamide is associated with state-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nsodium (Na+) channels, and modulation of stimulated release of glutamate. To what extent the non-\n\ndopaminergic effects contribute to the overall effect has not been established. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\n \n\nPopulation PK models developed from studies in patients with Parkinson’s disease indicate that the \n\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics effects of safinamide were not dependent on age, gender, \n\nweight, renal function and exposure to levodopa, indicating that dose adjustments will not be required \n\nbased on these variables. \n\n \n\nPooled analyses of adverse event data from placebo controlled studies in Parkinson’s disease patients \n\nindicate that the concomitant administration of safinamide together with a broad category of \n\ncommonly used medicinal products in this patient population (antihypertensive, beta-blockers \n\ncholesterol lowering, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, proton pump inhibitors, \n\nantidepressants, etc.) was not associated with an increased risk for adverse events. Studies were not \n\nstratified for co-medication, and no randomized interaction studies were performed for these medicinal \n\nproducts.  \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy \n\n \n\nStudies in mid- to late-stage PD patients \n\nThe efficacy of safinamide as add-on treatment in mid-to late-stage PD (LSPD) patients with motor \n\nfluctuations, currently receiving L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD medicinal products, \n\nwas evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: Study SETTLE (Study 27919; 50-100 \n\nmg/day; 24 weeks), and Study 016/018 (50 and 100 mg/day; 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled \n\nstudy).  \n\n \n\nThe primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to endpoint in ‘ON Time without \n\ntroublesome dyskinesia’.  \n\n \n\nSecondary efficacy parameters included OFF Time, UPDRS II and III (Unified Parkinson’s Disease \n\nRating Scale – sections II and III), and CGI-C (Clinical Global Impression of Change)  \n\n \n\nBoth the SETTLE and 016/018 studies indicated significant superiority of safinamide, compared to \n\nplacebo, at the target doses of 50 and 100 mg/day for the primary, and selected secondary, efficacy \n\nvariables, as summarized in the table below. The effect on ON Time was maintained at the end of the \n\n24-month double-blind treatment period for both safinamide doses as compared to placebo. \n\n \n\nStudy 016  \n\n(24 weeks) \n\n016/018  \n\n(2 years) \n\n27919 \n\n(SETTLE) \n\n (24 weeks) \n\nDose (mg/day) (a) \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafinamide \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafinamide \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafin-\n\namide \n\n50 100 50 100 \n50-100 \n\n(d) \n\nRandomized 222 223 224 222 223 224 275 274 \n\nAge (years) (b) 59.4 \n\n(9.5) \n\n60.1 \n\n(9.7) \n\n60.1 \n\n(9.2) \n\n59.4 \n\n(9.5) \n\n60.1 \n\n(9.7) \n\n60.1 \n\n(9.2) \n\n62.1 \n\n(9.0) \n\n61.7 \n\n(9.0) \n\nPD Duration (years) \n\n(b) \n8.4 (3.8) 7.9 (3.9) \n\n8.2 \n\n(3.8) \n8.4 (3.8) \n\n7.9 \n\n(3.9) \n\n8.2 \n\n(3.8) \n9.0 (4.9) \n\n8.9 \n\n(4.4) \n\nON time without troublesome dyskinesia (hrs) (c) \n\nBaseline (b) \n9.3 (2.2) 9.4 (2.2) \n\n9.6 \n\n(2.5) \n9.3 (2.2) \n\n9.4 \n\n(2.2) \n\n9.6 \n\n(2.5) \n9.1 (2.5) \n\n9.3 \n\n(2.4) \n\nChange LSM (SE) \n0.5 (0.2) 1.0 (0.2) \n\n1.2 \n\n(0.2) \n0.8 (0.2) \n\n1.4 \n\n(0.2) \n\n1.5 \n\n(0.2) \n0.6 (0.1) \n\n1.4 \n\n(0.1) \n\nLS Diff vs Placebo  0.5 0.7  0.6 0.7  0.9 \n\n\n\n11 \n\nStudy 016  \n\n(24 weeks) \n\n016/018  \n\n(2 years) \n\n27919 \n\n(SETTLE) \n\n (24 weeks) \n\nDose (mg/day) (a) \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafinamide \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafinamide \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafin-\n\namide \n\n50 100 50 100 \n50-100 \n\n(d) \n\n95% CI \n \n\n[0.1, \n\n0.9] \n\n[0.3, \n\n1.0] \n \n\n[0.1, \n\n1.0] \n\n[0.2, \n\n1.1] \n \n\n[0.6, \n\n1.2] \n\np-value \n 0.0054 0.0002  0.0110 0.0028  \n\n<0.000\n\n1 \n\nOFF time (hrs) (c) \n\nBaseline (b) \n5.3 (2.1) 5.2 (2.0) \n\n5.2 \n\n(2.2) \n5.3 (2.1) \n\n5.2 \n\n(2.2) \n\n5.2 \n\n(2.1) \n5.4 (2.0) \n\n5.3 \n\n(2.0) \n\nChange LSM (SE) -0.8  \n\n(0.20) \n\n-1.4  \n\n(0.20) \n\n-1.5  \n\n(0.20) \n\n-1.0  \n\n(0.20) \n\n-1.5  \n\n(0.19) \n\n-1.6  \n\n(0.19) \n\n-0.5  \n\n(0.10) \n\n-1.5  \n\n(0.10) \n\nLS Diff vs Placebo  -0.6 -0.7  -0.5 -0.6  -1.0 \n\n95% CI \n \n\n[-0.9,  \n\n-0.3] \n\n[-1.0,  \n\n-0.4] \n \n\n[-0.8,  \n\n-0.2] \n\n[-0.9,  \n\n-0.3] \n \n\n[-1.3,  \n\n-0.7] \n\np-value \n 0.0002 \n\n<0.000\n\n1 \n 0.0028 0.0003  \n\n<0.000\n\n1 \n\nUPDRS III (c) \n\nBaseline (b) 28.6  \n\n(12.0) \n\n27.3  \n\n(12.8) \n\n28.4  \n\n(13.5) \n\n28.6  \n\n(12.0) \n\n27.3  \n\n(12.8) \n\n28.4  \n\n(13.5) \n\n23.0  \n\n(12.8) \n\n22.3  \n\n(11.8) \n\nChange LSM (SE) -4.5  \n\n(0.83) \n\n-6.1  \n\n(0.82) \n\n-6.8  \n\n(0.82) \n\n-4.4  \n\n(0.85) \n\n-5.6  \n\n(0.84) \n\n-6.5  \n\n(0.84) \n\n-2.6  \n\n(0.34) \n\n-3.5  \n\n(0.34) \n\nLS Diff vs Placebo  -1.6 -2.3  -1.2 -2.1  -0.9 \n\n95% CI \n \n\n[-3.0,  \n\n-0.2] \n\n[-3.7,  \n\n-0.9] \n \n\n[-2.6,  \n\n0.2] \n\n[-3.5,  \n\n-0.6] \n \n\n[-1.8,  \n\n0.0] \n\np-value  0.0207 0.0010  0.0939 0.0047  0.0514 \n\nUPDRS II (c) \n\nBaseline (b) 12.2 \n\n(5.9) \n\n11.8 \n\n(5.7) \n\n12.1 \n\n(5.9) \n\n12.2 \n\n(5.9) \n\n11.8 \n\n(5.7) \n\n12.1 \n\n(5.9) \n\n10.4 \n\n(6.3) \n\n10.0 \n\n(5.6) \n\nChange LSM (SE) -1.2 \n\n(0.4) \n\n-1.9 \n\n(0.4) \n\n-2.3 \n\n(0.4) \n\n-1.4 \n\n(0.3) \n\n-2.0 \n\n(0.3) \n\n-2.5 \n\n(0.3) \n\n-0.8 \n\n(0.2) \n\n-1.2 \n\n(0.2) \n\nLS Diff vs Placebo  -0.7 -1.1  -0.6 -1.1  -0.4 \n\n95% CI \n \n\n[-1.3,  \n\n-0.0] \n\n[-1.7,  \n\n-0.5] \n \n\n[-1.3,  \n\n0.0] \n\n[-1.8,  \n\n-0.4] \n \n\n[-0.9,  \n\n0.0] \n\np-value  0.0367 0.0007  0.0676 0.0010  0.0564 \n\nResponder analyses (post-hoc) (e) n(%) \n\nON time increase ≥60 \n\nminutes  \n\n93  \n\n(43.9) \n\n119  \n\n(54.8) \n\n121  \n\n(56.0) \n\n100  \n\n(47.2) \n\n125  \n\n(57.6) \n\n117  \n\n(54.2) \n\n116  \n\n(42.5) \n\n152  \n\n(56.3) \n\np-value  0.0233 0.0122  0.0308 0.1481  0.0013 \n\n≥60 minutes increase \n\nON time and decrease \n\nin OFF time and ≥ 30% \n\nimprovement UPDRS \n\nIII \n\n32 \n\n(15.1) \n\n52 \n\n(24.0) \n\n56 \n\n(25.9) \n28 (13.2) \n\n43 \n\n(19.8) \n\n42 \n\n(19.4) \n24 (8.8) \n\n49 \n\n(18.1) \n\np-value  0.0216 0.0061  0.0671 0.0827  0.0017 \n\nCGI-C: patients who \n\nwere much/very much \n\nimproved \n\n42 \n\n(19.8) \n\n72 \n\n(33.2) \n\n78 \n\n(36.1) \n46 (21.7) \n\n62 \n\n(28.6) \n\n64 \n\n(29.6) \n26 (9.5) \n\n66 \n\n(24.4) \n\np-value (f) \n 0.0017 0.0002  0.0962 0.0575  \n\n<0.000\n\n1 \n\n\n\n12 \n\nStudy 016  \n\n(24 weeks) \n\n016/018  \n\n(2 years) \n\n27919 \n\n(SETTLE) \n\n (24 weeks) \n\nDose (mg/day) (a) \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafinamide \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafinamide \n\nPlacebo \n\nSafin-\n\namide \n\n50 100 50 100 \n50-100 \n\n(d) \n\n(a) Daily targeted dose, (b) Mean (SD), (c) analysis population (mITT);

Absolute bioavailability is high (95%), showing that \n\nsafinamide is almost completely absorbed after oral administration and first pass metabolism is \n\nnegligible. The high absorption classifies safinamide as a highly permeable substance.  \n\n \n\nDistribution \n\n \n\nThe volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately 165 L which is 2.5-fold of body volume indicating \n\nextensive extravascular distribution of safinamide. Total clearance was determined to be 4.6 L/h \n\nclassifying safinamide as a low clearance substance.  \n\n \n\nPlasma protein binding of safinamide is 88-90%. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\n \n\nIn humans, safinamide is almost exclusively eliminated via metabolism (urinary excretion of \n\nunchanged safinamide was <10%) mediated principally through high capacity amidases, that have not \n\nyet been characterized. In vitro experiments indicated that inhibition of amidases in human \n\nhepatocytes led to complete suppression of the NW-1153 formation. Amidase present in blood, \n\nplasma, serum, simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid as well as human \n\ncarboxylesterases hCE-1 and hCE-2 are not responsible for the biotransformation of safinamide to \n\nNW-1153. The amidase FAAH was able to catalyse the formation of NW-1153 at low rates only. \n\nTherefore, other amidases are likely to be involved in the conversion to NW-1153. Safinamide’s \n\nmetabolism is not dependent on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) based enzymes. \n\n \n\nMetabolite structure elucidation revealed three metabolic pathways of safinamide. The principal \n\npathway involves hydrolytic oxidation of the amide moiety leading to the primary metabolite \n\n‘safinamide acid’ (NW-1153). Another pathway involves oxidative cleavage of the ether bond forming \n\n‘O-debenzylated safinamide’ (NW-1199). Finally the ‘N-dealkylated acid’ (NW-1689) is formed by \n\noxidative cleavage of the amine bond of either safinamide (minor) or the primary safinamide acid \n\n\n\n13 \n\nmetabolite (NW-1153) (major). The ‘N-dealkylated acid’ (NW-1689) undergoes conjugation with \n\nglucuronic acid yielding its acyl glucuronide. None of these metabolites are pharmacologically active. \n\n \n\nSafinamide does not appear to significantly induce or inhibit enzymes at clinically relevant systemic \n\nconcentrations. In vitro metabolism studies have indicated that there is no meaningful induction or \n\ninhibition of cytochrome P450, CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/5 at \n\nconcentrations which are relevant (Cmax of free safinamide 0.4 µM at 100 mg/day) in man. Dedicated \n\ndrug-drug interaction studies performed with ketoconazole, L-dopa and CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 \n\nsubstrates (caffeine and midazolam), did not detect any clinically significant effects on the \n\npharmacokinetics of safinamide, or L-dopa, caffeine and midazolam.  \n\n \n\nA mass balance study showed that the plasma AUC0-24h of the unchanged 14C-safinamide accounted for \n\napproximately 30% of the total radioactivity AUC0-24h, indicative of an extensive metabolism.  \n\n \n\nTransporters \n\n \n\nPreliminary in vitro studies have shown that safinamide is not a substrate for the transporters P-gp, \n\nBCRP, OAT1B1, OAT1B3, OATP1A2 or OAT2P1. Metabolite NW-1153 is not a substrate for OCT2, \n\nor OAT1, but it is substrate for OAT3. This interaction has the potential to reduce the clearance of NW-\n\n1153 and increase its exposure; however the systemic exposure of NW-1153 is low (1/10 of parent \n\nsafinamide), and as it is metabolised to secondary and tertiary metabolites, it is unlikely to be of any \n\nclinical relevance.  \n\n \n\nSafinamide transiently inhibits BCRP in the small intestine (see section 4.5). At concentrations of \n\n50µM, safinamide inhibited OATP1A2 and OATP2P1. The relevant plasma concentrations of \n\nsafinamide are substantially lower, therefore a clinically relevant interaction with co-administered \n\nsubstrates of these transporters is unlikely. NW-1153 is not an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1, or \n\nMATE2-K up to concentrations of 5µM. \n\n \n\nLinearity/non-linearity \n\n \n\nThe pharmacokinetics of safinamide are linear after single and repeated doses. No time-dependency was \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\n \n\nSafinamide undergoes almost complete metabolic transformation (<10% of the administered dose was \n\nfound unchanged in urine). Substance-related radioactivity was largely excreted in urine (76%) and only \n\nto a low extent in faeces (1.5%) after 192 hours. The terminal elimination half-life of total radioactivity \n\nwas approximately 80 hours.  \n\n \n\nThe elimination half-life of safinamide is 20-30 hours. Steady-state is reached within one week. \n\n \n\nPatients with hepatic impairment \n\n \n\nSafinamide exposure in patients with mild hepatic disease increased marginally (30% in AUC), while \n\nin patients with moderate hepatic impairment exposure increased by approximately 80% (see section \n\n4.2). \n\n \n\nPatients with renal impairment \n\n \n\nModerate or severe renal impairment did not alter the exposure to safinamide, compared to healthy \n\nsubjects (see section 4.2).  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nRetinal degeneration was observed in rodents after repeated safinamide dosing resulting in systemic \n\nexposure below the anticipated systemic exposure in patients given the maximal therapeutic dose. No \n\nretinal degeneration was noted in monkeys despite higher systemic exposure than in rodents or in \n\npatients at the maximum human dose. \n\n \n\nLong-term studies in animals have shown convulsions (1.6 to 12.8 times human clinical exposure, \n\nbased on plasma AUC). Liver hypertrophy and fatty changes were seen only in rodent livers at \n\nexposures similar to humans. Phospholipidosis was seen mainly in the lungs in rodents (at exposures \n\nsimilar to humans) and monkeys (at exposures greater than 12 fold higher than human). \n\n \n\nSafinamide did not present genotoxic potential in in vivo and in several in vitro systems using bacteria \n\nor mammalian cells.  \n\n \n\nThe results obtained from carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of tumorigenic \n\npotential related to safinamide at systemic exposures up to 2.3 to 4.0 times respectively, the \n\nanticipated systemic exposure in patients given the maximal therapeutic dose.  \n\n \n\nFertility studies in female rats showed reduced number of implantations and corpora lutea at exposures \n\nin excess of 3 times the anticipated human exposure. Male rats showed minor abnormal morphology \n\nand reduced speed of sperm cells at exposures in excess of 1.4 times the anticipated human exposure. \n\nMale rat fertility was not affected. \n\n \n\nIn embryo-foetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits malformations were induced at safinamide \n\nexposures 2 and 3-fold above human clinical exposure, respectively. The combination of safinamide \n\nwith levodopa/carbidopa resulted in additive effects in the embryo-foetal development studies with a \n\nhigher incidence of foetal skeletal abnormalities than seen with either treatment alone.  \n\n \n\nIn a pre- and postnatal developmental rat study, pup mortality, absence of milk in the stomach and \n\nneonatal hepatotoxicity were observed at dose levels similar to the anticipated clinical exposure. Toxic \n\neffects on the liver and accompanying symptoms as yellow/orange skin and skull, in pups exposed to \n\nsafinamide during lactation are mediated mainly via in utero exposure, whereas exposure via the \n\nmother’s milk had only a minor influence.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \n\nTablet core \n\n \n\nMicrocrystalline cellulose \n\nCrospovidone type A \n\nMagnesium stearate \n\nSilica, colloidal anhydrous \n\n \n\nFilm-coating \n\n \n\nHypromellose \n\nMacrogol (6000) \n\nTitanium dioxide (E171) \n\nIron oxide red (E172) \n\nMica (E555) \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \n\nNot applicable \n\n \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \n\n4 years  \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \n\nThis medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions. \n\n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container  \n \n\nPVC/PVDC/Aluminium blister packs of 14, 28, 30, 90 and 100 tablets. \n\n \n\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal \n \n\nNo special requirements for disposal. \n\n \n\n \n\n7 MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER \n \n\nZambon S.p.A. \n\nVia Lillo del Duca 10 \n\n20091 Bresso (MI) - Italy \n\nTel: +39 02 665241 \n\nFax: +39 02 66501492 \n\nEmail: info.zambonspa@zambongroup.com \n\n \n\n \n\n8 MARKETING AUTHORISATION NUMBER(S)  \n \n\nXadago 50 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nEU/1/14/984/001 \n\nEU/1/14/984/002 \n\nEU/1/14/984/003 \n\nEU/1/14/984/004 \n\nEU/1/14/984/005 \n\n \n\nXadago 100 mg film-coated tablets \n\n \n\nEU/1/14/984/006 \n\nEU/1/14/984/007 \n\nEU/1/14/984/008 \n\nEU/1/14/984/009 \n\nEU/1/14/984/010 \n\n \n\n \n\n9 DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION \n \n\nDate of first authorisation: 24 February 2015 \n\nDate of latest renewal: \n\n \n\nmailto:info.zambonspa@zambongroup.com\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n10 DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT \n \n\nDetailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines \n\nAgency http://www.ema.europa.eu. \n\n  \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nANNEX II \n\n \n\nA.

You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed \nin this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Xadago is and what it is used for  \n\n2.

What Xadago is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nXadago is a medicine that contains the active substance safinamide. It acts to increase the level of a \n\nsubstance called dopamine in the brain, which is involved in the control of movement and is present in \n\nreduced amounts in the brain of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Xadago is used for the treatment of \n\nParkinson’s disease in adults.  \n\n \n\nIn mid- to late-stage patients experiencing sudden switches between being “ON” and able to move and \n\nbeing “OFF” and having difficulties moving about, Xadago is added to a stable dose of the medicine \n\ncalled levodopa alone or in combination with other medicines for Parkinson’s disease. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you take Xadago \n\n \n\nDo not take Xadago \n- If you are allergic to safinamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6).  \n\n- If you are taking any of the following medicines: \n- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as selegiline, rasagiline, moclobemide, \n\nphenelzine, isocarboxazid, tranylcypromine (e.g. for treatment of Parkinson’s disease or \n\ndepression, or used for any other condition).  \n\n- Pethidine (a strong pain killer).  \nYou must wait at least 7 days after stopping Xadago treatment before starting treatment with \n\nMAO inhibitors or pethidine. \n\n- If you have been told that you have severe liver problems  \n- If you have an eye condition which might put you at risk of potential damage to your retina (the \n\nlight sensitive layers at the back of your eyes), e.g. albinism (lack of pigment in your skin and \n\neyes), retinal degeneration (loss of cells from light sensitive layer at the back of the eye), or \n\nuveitis (inflammation inside of the eye), inherited retinopathy (inherited disorders of the vision), \n\nor severe progressive diabetic retinopathy (a progressive decrease of the vision due to diabetes). \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor before taking Xadago  \n\n- If  you have liver problems  \n- Patients and carers should be made aware that certain compulsive behaviours such as \n\ncompulsions, obsessive thoughts, pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, \n\nimpulsive behaviour and compulsive spending or buying have been reported with other \n\nmedicines for Parkinson’s disease.  \n\n- Uncontrollable jerky movements may occur or worsen when Xadago is used together with \nlevodopa.  \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nXadago is not recommended for use in children and adolescents, below 18 years old due to the lack of \n\ndata on safety and efficacy in this population. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Xadago \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Ask your doctor for advice before taking any of the following medicines together with \n\nXadago:  \n\n- Cold or cough remedies containing dextromethorphan, ephedrine or pseudoephedrine \n- Medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) typically used to treat anxiety \n\ndisorders, and some personality disorders (e.g. fluoxetine or fluvoxamine) \n\n- Medicines called serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), used in the treatment of \nmajor depression and other mood disorders, such as venlafaxine \n\n- Medicines for high cholesterol such as rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin \n- Fluoroquinolone antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin \n- Medicines that affect the immune system such as methotrexate  \n- Medicines to treat metastatic carcinoma such as topotecan \n- Medicine to treat pain and inflammation such as diclofenac \n- Medicines to treat type 2 diabetes such as glyburide, metformin \n- Medicines to treat virus infection such as aciclovir, ganciclovir \n  \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine.  \n\n \n\nPregnancy  \n\nXadago should not be used during pregnancy or by women of childbearing potential not practicing \n\nadequate contraception. \n\n \n\nBreast Feeding \n\nXadago is likely to be excreted in breast milk. Xadago should not be used during breast-feeding. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nSomnolence and dizziness may occur during safinamide treatment; you should be cautious about \n\noperating hazardous machines or driving, until you are reasonably certain that Xadago does not affect \n\nyou in any way.  \n\n \n\nAsk your doctor for advice prior to driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to take Xadago \n\n \n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not \n\nsure. \n\n \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder\n\n\n30 \n\nThe recommended starting dose of Xadago is one 50 mg tablet that may be increased to one 100 mg \n\ntablet, taken once daily preferably in the morning by mouth with water. Xadago may be taken with or \n\nwithout food.  \n\n \n\nIf you suffer from moderately reduced liver function, you should not take more than 50 mg a day; your \n\ndoctor will advise if this applies to you. \n\n \n\nIf you take more Xadago than you should \nIf you have taken too many Xadago tablets, you may develop raised blood pressure, anxiety, \n\nconfusion, forgetfulness, sleepiness, lightheadedness; feel sick or be sick; dilated pupils or develop \n\ninvoluntary jerky movements.
