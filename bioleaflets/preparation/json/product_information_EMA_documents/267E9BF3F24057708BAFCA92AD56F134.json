I \n\n \n\nSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Rapid 40 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Rapid 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 10 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 5 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of solution for \n\ninjection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Rapid is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n\n*Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. Insuman Rapid is also suitable for the \n\ntreatment of hyperglycaemic coma and ketoacidosis, as well as for achieving pre-, intra- and \n\npost-operative stabilisation in patients with diabetes mellitus. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nIn the treatment of severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis in particular, insulin administration is part of \n\na complex therapeutic regimen which includes measures to protect patients from possible severe \n\ncomplications of a relatively rapid lowering of blood glucose. This regimen requires close monitoring \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n(metabolic status, acid-base and electrolyte status, vital parameters etc.) in an intensive care unit or \n\nsimilar setting. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population(≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Rapid must not be used in external or implanted insulin pumps or in peristaltic pumps with \n\nsilicone tubing. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is administered subcutaneously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection \n\nsyringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \n\ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid may also be administered intravenously. Intravenous insulin therapy must generally \n\ntake place in an intensive care unit or under comparable monitoring and treatment conditions (see \n\n\"Daily doses and timing of administration\"). \n\n \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Rapid for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Rapid, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Rapid \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5)  \n\n \n\nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) \nprior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Rapid can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class \n\nand in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n(1/1,000 to 1/100); rare (1/10,000 to 1/1,000); very rare (1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \n\nfrom the available data). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is \n\nthe phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4.). \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \n\nATC Code: A10AB01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following subcutaneous \n\ninjection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1 and 4 hours \n\nafter injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge contains 3 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach pen contains 3 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Rapid is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n\n*Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection. \n\n \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Rapid is injected subcutaneously 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population(≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Rapid must not be used in external or implanted insulin pumps or in peristaltic pumps with \n\nsilicone tubing. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is administered subcutaneously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used (see \n\nsection 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\n \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Rapid for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Rapid, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Rapid \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nPens to be used with Insuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in cartridges \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Rapid cartridges should only be used with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Rapid in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Rapid in 1 \nunit dose increments. \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens (see section 4.2 and 6.6). \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \nInsuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nHandling of the pen \n\nInsuman Rapid SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe or intravenous injection is necessary, a vial should be used (see \n\nsection 4.2).Before using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be \n\nread carefully. SoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n\n \nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Rapid can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (1/1,000 to 1/100); rare (1/10,000 to 1/1,000); very rare (1/10,000), not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is \n\nthe phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \n\nATC Code: A10AB01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Rapid is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. Following subcutaneous \n\ninjection, onset of action is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1 and 4 hours \n\nafter injection and the duration of action is 7 to 9 hours. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n19 \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \n\nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous \n\nadministration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Basal 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Basal 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of \n\nsuspension for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge, Insuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge or pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Basal is an isophane insulin suspension. \n \n\n*Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSuspension for injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Basal is injected subcutaneously 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Basal must never be injected intravenously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection \n\nsyringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \n\ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. \n\nIf administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Basal for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Basal, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Basal \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nPens to be used with Insuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. \n\nIf administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Basal cartridges should only be used with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Basal in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, and AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Basal in 1 \nunit dose increments. \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens. \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nHandling of the pen \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Basal can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site erythema; \n\nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \n\nintermediate-acting, ATC Code: A10AC01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n30 \n \n\nInsuman Basal (an isophane insulin suspension) is an insulin with gradual onset and long duration of \n\naction. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is within 60 minutes, the phase of maximum \n\naction is between 3 and 4 hours after injection and the duration of action is 11 to 20 hours. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \n\nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n \n\n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted \n\nappearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Basal must not be used \n\nif this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or \n\nflocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes \n\ngive the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be \n\nused. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Basal may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed \n\nspecifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. \n\n \n\nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \n\nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \n\npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsulin pen \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman Basal cartridges are \n\nto be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar , AllStar PRO or \n\nJuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. \n\n \n\nThe manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nCartridges \n\nBefore insertion into the pen, Insuman Basal must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and \n\nthen resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth \n\n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \n\nmixing of the contents. \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior \n\nto each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Basal must not be used \n\nif this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or \n\nflocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement \n\nchanges substantially. \n\n \n\nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \n\nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Basal cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBefore first use, Insuman Basal must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then \n\nresuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least \n\nten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of \n\nthe contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Basal must not be used \n\nif this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles or \n\nflocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\nIt must be remembered that insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range. \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nBefore using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must \n\nbe read carefully. \n\n \n \n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge, Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge or pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 15% dissolved insulin and \n\n85% crystalline protamine insulin. \n\n \n\n* Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSuspension for injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Comb 15 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 15 must never be injected \n\nintravenously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \n\ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Com 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 15 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Comb 15, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Comb 15 \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nPens to be used with Insuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Com 15 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 15 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 15 in 1 \nunit dose increments. \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens. \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nHandling of the pen \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 15 can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class \n\nand in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n\n(1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated \n\nfrom the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site \n\nerythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \n\nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Comb 15 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 15% dissolved insulin) is an insulin \n\nwith gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is \n\nwithin 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the \n\nduration of action is 11 to 20 hours. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n42 \n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \n\nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n \n\n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted \n\nappearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 15 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes \n\ngive the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be \n\nused. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed \n\nspecifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. \n\n \n\nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \n\nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \n\npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsulin pen \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman Comb 15 cartridges \n\nare to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO \n\nor JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. \n\n \n\nThe manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nCartridges \n\nBefore insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 15 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and \n\nthen resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth \n\n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \n\nmixing of the contents. \n\n \n\nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior \n\nto each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 15 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nchanges substantially. \n\nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \n\nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 15 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBefore first use, Insuman Comb 15 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then \n\nresuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least \n\nten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of \n\nthe contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 15 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nBefore using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must \n\nbe read carefully. \n\n \n \n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge, Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge or pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 25% dissolved insulin and \n\n75% crystalline protamine insulin. \n\n \n\n* Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSuspension for injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Comb 25 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 25 must never be injected \n\nintravenously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection \n\nsyringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \n\ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 25 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Comb 25, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Comb 25 \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nPens to be used with Insuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Comb 25 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 25 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 25 in 1 \nunit dose increments. \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens. \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nHandling of the pen \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 25 can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site \n\nerythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes insulins and analogues for injection, \n\nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Comb 25 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 25% dissolved insulin) is an insulin \n\nwith gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is \n\nwithin 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the \n\nduration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \n\nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n \n\n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted \n\nappearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 25 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes \n\ngive the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be \n\nused. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed \n\nspecifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. \n\n \n\nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \n\nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \n\npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsulin pen \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Comb 25 cartridges are to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen \n\n24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO or JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be \n\nmarketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. \n\n \n\nThe manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nCartridges \n\nBefore insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and \n\nthen resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth \n\n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \n\nmixing of the contents. \n\n \n\nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior \n\nto each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 25 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement \n\nchanges substantially. \n\n \n\nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \n\nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 25 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nBefore first use, Insuman Comb 25 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then \n\nresuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least \n\nten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of \n\nthe contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 25 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nBefore using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must \n\nbe read carefully. \n\n \n \n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin, or 10 ml of \n\nsuspension for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge, Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge or pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 30% dissolved insulin and \n\n70% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \n\n* Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSuspension for injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Comb 30 is injected subcutaneously 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses.\n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 30 must never be injected \n\nintravenously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \n\ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 30 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available \n\nmust only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction \n\nwith anti-allergic treatment. \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Comb 30, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Comb 30 \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting,etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nPens to be used with Insuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Comb 30 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 30 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 30 in 1 \nunit dose increments. \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens. \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country(see section 4.2 and 6.6). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nHandling of the pen \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n\n \nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 30 can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type allergic \n\nreactions (hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative retinopathy; \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \n\nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \n\ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site erythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \n\nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Comb 30 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 30% dissolved insulin) is an insulin \n\nwith gradual onset and long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of action is \n\nwithin 30 to 60 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 2 and 4 hours after injection and the \n\nduration of action is 12 to 19 hours. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n67 \n \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \n\nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n\n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted \n\nappearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 30 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\ngive the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be \n\nused. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed \n\nspecifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. \n\n \n\nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \n\nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \n\npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsulin pen \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman Comb 30 cartridges \n\nare to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar , AllStar PRO \n\nor JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. \n\n \n\nThe manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nCartridges \n\nBefore insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 30 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and \n\nthen resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth \n\n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \n\nmixing of the contents. \n\n \n\nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior \n\nto each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 30 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement \n\nchanges substantially. \n\n \n\nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \n\nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 30 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBefore first use, Insuman Comb 30 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then \n\nresuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least \n\nten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of \n\nthe contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 30 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes \n\nsubstantially. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nBefore using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must \n\nbe read carefully. \n\n \n\nBefore using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must \n\nbe read carefully. \n\n \n \n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 40 IU insulin human (equivalent to 1.4 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 10 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 400 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 5 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 500 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge, Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge or pen contains 3 ml of suspension for injection, equivalent to 300 IU insulin. \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is a biphasic isophane insulin suspension consisting of 50% dissolved insulin and \n\n50% crystalline protamine insulin. \n \n\n* Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSuspension for injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, milky-white suspension. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels, the insulin preparations to be used and the insulin dose regimen \n\n(doses and timings) must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical \n\nactivity and life-style. \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\ndaily requirement. Insuman Comb 50 is injected subcutaneously 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is administered subcutaneously. Insuman Comb 50 must never be injected \n\nintravenously. \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). Injection sites within an injection \n\narea must be rotated from one injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and \n\ncutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 40 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (40 IU per ml) are to be used. The injection \n\nsyringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nOnly injection syringes designed for this strength of insulin (100 IU per ml) are to be used. The \n\ninjection syringes must not contain any other medicinal product or residue (e.g. traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Comb 50 for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Comb 50, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Comb 50 \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n\n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nPens to be used with Insuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. \n\nThe Insuman Comb 50 cartridges should only be used with the following pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers Insuman Comb 50 in 0.5 unit dose increments \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Insuman Comb 50 in 1 \nunit dose increments. \n\nThese cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been \n\nestablished with the listed pens. \n\nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6). \n\n \nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nHandling of the pen \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). \n\nBefore using SoloStar, the Instructions for Use included in the Package Leaflet must be read carefully. \n\nSoloStar has to be used as recommended in these Instructions for Use (see section 6.6). \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Comb 50 can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and \n\nsubcutaneous tissue \n\ndisorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders \n\nand administration \n\nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site \n\nerythema; \nInjection site swelling \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, \n\nintermediate-acting combined with fast-acting, ATC Code: A10AD01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n79 \n \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n\n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n\n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Comb 50 (a biphasic isophane insulin suspension with 50% dissolved insulin) is an insulin \n\nwith rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. Following subcutaneous injection, onset of \n\naction is within 30 minutes, the phase of maximum action is between 1.5 and 4 hours after injection \n\nand the duration of action is 12 to 16 hours. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in \n\nrabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\n \n \n\n6.

This is best done by rolling the vial at an oblique angle between the palms of the hands. \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this may lead to changes in the suspension (giving the vial a frosted \n\nappearance; see below) and cause frothing. Froth may interfere with the correct measurement of the \n\ndose. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 50 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the vial. These changes sometimes \n\ngive the vial a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new vial yielding a uniform suspension must be \n\nused. It is also necessary to change to a new vial if the insulin requirement changes substantially. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human formulations, but not with those designed \n\nspecifically for use in insulin pumps. Concerning incompatibility with other insulins, see section 6.2. \n\n \n\nIf two different insulins have to be drawn into one single injection syringe, it is recommended that the \n\nshorter-acting insulin be drawn first to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting \n\npreparation. It is advisable to inject immediately after mixing. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nInsulin pen \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable \n\npen. If administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Insuman comb 50 cartridges \n\nare to be used only in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO \n\nor JuniorSTAR (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nThe manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nCartridges \n\nBefore insertion into the pen, Insuman Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and \n\nthen resuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the cartridge back and forth \n\n(at least ten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough \n\nmixing of the contents. \n\n \n\nLater on, when the cartridge has been inserted into the pen, the insulin must be resuspended again prior \n\nto each injection. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least ten times). \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 50 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new cartridge yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new cartridge if the insulin requirement \n\nchanges substantially. \n\n \n\nAir bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). \n\nEmpty cartridges must not be refilled. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 must not be administered intravenously and must not be used in infusion pumps or \n\nexternal or implanted insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Comb 50 cartridges are not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar 100 IU/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If \n\nadministration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2 and 4.4). \n\n \n\nBefore first use, Insuman Comb 50 must be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then \n\nresuspended to check the contents. This is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth (at least \n\nten times). Each cartridge contains three small metal balls to facilitate quick and thorough mixing of \n\nthe contents. Later on, the insulin must be resuspended again prior to each injection. \n\n \n\nAfter resuspension, the fluid must have a uniformly milky appearance. Insuman Comb 50 must not be \n\nused if this cannot be achieved, i.e. if the suspension remains clear, for example, or if clumps, particles \n\nor flocculation appear in the insulin or stick to the wall or bottom of the cartridge. These changes \n\nsometimes give the cartridge a frosted appearance. In such cases, a new pen yielding a uniform \n\nsuspension must be used. It is also necessary to change to a new pen if the insulin requirement changes \n\nsubstantially. \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\nEmpty pens must never be re-used and must be properly discarded. \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\nIt must be remembered that \n\n- insulin protamine crystals dissolve in an acid pH range, \n- the soluble insulin part precipitates out at a pH of approximately 4.5 to 6.5. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin \n\nhuman and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nBefore using the SoloStar pre-filled pen, the Instructions for Use included in the package leaflet must \n\nbe read carefully. \n\n \n \n\n7.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\nInsuman Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nInsuman Infusat 100 IU/ml in a vial \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach vial contains 10 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 1000 IU insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat 100 IU/ml in a cartridge \n\nEach ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg). \n\nEach cartridge contains 3.15 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 315 IU insulin. \n\nOne IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin*. \n\nInsuman Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n \n\n* Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for injection . \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nDiabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nPosology \n\nInsuman Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin pumps. It is specially \n\nstabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and thermal stress in such \n\npumps. Insuman Infusat is therefore also suitable for continuous insulin infusion with other, \n\nconventional injection syringe pumps. \n\n \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and \n\nadjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nWhen used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously \n\n(\"basal rate\"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals. Refer to the \n\noperating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the necessary \n\nsafety precautions. \n\n \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. However, the average insulin requirement is often \n\n0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day. The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\ndaily requirement. Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, \n\nand the rest is given as bolus injections before meals. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if \n\n- the patient's weight changes, \n- the patient's life-style changes, \n- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \n\nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). \n\n \nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≧65 years old) \nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Refer to the technical \n\nmanual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat may be infused by the subcutaneous route. It is designed for use in the Hoechst \n\nInfusor and H-Tron insulin pumps. \n\nInsuman Infusat in a vial may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it has been shown that \n\nthey are suitable for this insulin (see pump manual). \n\nInsuman Infusat in a cartridge may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it has been shown \n\nthat they are suitable for this insulin and this type of cartridge (see pump manual). \n\nOnly tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used. \n\n \n\nInsulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions. This is facilitated by the special equipment \n\navailable for the insulin pumps (e.g. catheters, cannulas). \n\n \n\nInsulin absorption and hence the blood-glucose-lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection \n\narea to another (e.g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh). The puncture site within a given \n\ninjection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days) in order to reduce the risk of \n\nlipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). \n\n \n\nFor further details on handling, see section 6.6. \n\n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \n\nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must \n\nonly continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer \n\nto Insuman Infusat, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\n \n\nIn case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient \n\nhas recovered complete consciousness. \n\n \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all \n\nother relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nTransfer to Insuman Infusat \n\nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \n\nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), \n\norigin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need \n\nfor a change in dose. \n\n \n\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. Alternatively, \n\nit may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose regimen reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who \n\n- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels, \n- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia, \n- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies. \n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. In \n\npatients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under \n\nmedical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \n\ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin absorption \n\nand worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A sudden change in \n\nthe injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose \n\nmonitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic \n\nmedications may be considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished. \n\nThe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain \n\nrisk groups. These include patients: \n\n- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, \n- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, \n- who are elderly, \n- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, \n- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, \n- with a long history of diabetes, \n- suffering from a psychiatric illness, \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n- change in the injection area, \n- improved insulin sensitivity (e.g. by removal of stress factors), \n- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, \n- intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), \n- inadequate food intake, \n- missed meals, \n- alcohol consumption, \n- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \n\nadrenocortical insufficiency), \n\n- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). \n \n\nInsulin pump faults \n\nHyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed \n\ncompletely. Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to a \n\nbolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction. \n\n \n\nIn the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or \n\npen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection. For details on safety precautions in the use of \n\ninsulin pumps, refer to the operator’s manual. \n\n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones are \n\nindicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. \n\nand they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors have been reported in which other Insuman formulations or other insulins have been \n\naccidentally administered. Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid \n\nmedication errors between insulin human and other insulins. \n\n \n\nCombination of Insuman with pioglitazone \n\nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \n\nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \n\nmind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Insuman is considered. If the combination \n\nis used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. \n\nPioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Insulin does not cross the \n\nplacental barrier. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Insuman Infusat can be used during breast-feeding. \n\nBreast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In clinical studies and during marketed \n\nuse, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens. Therefore, no specific frequency \n\ncan be presented. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ \n\nclass and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); \n\nuncommon (1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known \n\n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\nMedDRA system \norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nOedema  Hypoglycaemia; \nSodium retention \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy; \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \n\nVisual impairment \n\nSkin and subcutaneous \ntissue disorders \n\n  Lipodystrophy; \nCutaneous amyloidosis \n\nGeneral disorders and \n\nadministration site \n\nconditions \n\nInjection site reactions Injection site urticaria Injection site \n\ninflammation; \n\nInjection site pain; \n\nInjection site pruritus; \n\nInjection site erythema; \n\nInjection site swelling \n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n\nImmune system disorders \n\n \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such \n\nanti-insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to \n\nhyper- or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. \n\nProlonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEyes disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\n \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n\nLipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin \n\nabsorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nreduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n\nMost minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting, \n\nATC Code: A10AB01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in themuscles \n\nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Infusat is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \n\nIn healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes. It is longer in \n\npatients with severe renal insufficiency. However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin \n\ndo not reflect its metabolic action. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nThe acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No evidence of toxic \n\neffects was found. Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration \n\nin rabbits gave no remarkable findings. Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous \n\nadministration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n92 \n \n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nInsuman Implantable 400 IU/ml solution for infusion \n\n \n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne ml of solution contains 400 IU insulin human* (equivalent to 14 mg). \n\nOne 10 ml vial of solution contains 4,000 IU insulin. One IU (International Unit) corresponds to \n\n0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin). \n\n*Insulin human is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli. \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for infusion (infusion). \n\nClear, colourless solution. \n\n \n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nInsuman Implantable is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus that \n\ncannot be controlled with subcutaneous insulin (including pump) therapy, presenting with frequent, \n\notherwise unexplained severe hyper-and/or hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \n\nThe prescription of this medicinal product is restricted to centres certified by Medtronic as having \n\nreceived adequate training in the use of the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. \n\n \n\nUse of Insuman Implantable should be supervised by a physician experienced in diabetes and \n\ncompetent in using intraperitoneal insulin. \n\n \n\nPosology \n \n\nThe desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dose regimen must be determined individually and \n\nadjusted to suit the patient’s diet, physical activity and life-style. Frequent adjustments of insulin doses \n\nunder strict medical supervision are often required for several weeks following pump implantation. \n\n \n\nThe pump is not connected to a glucose meter, and as such, patients are advised to practice good \n\ndiabetes self management and test their own blood glucose levels at least four times daily to detect \n\npotential malfunction of the pump, to monitor glycaemic control and to determine required insulin \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nDaily doses and timing of administration \n\nThere are no fixed rules for insulin dose regimen. A part of the daily insulin dose (\"basal rate\") is \n\ninfused continuously by the implantable pump and the remaining part of the daily dose is administered \n\nby the patient, using the same pump, as a bolus before meals. The basal metabolic requirement is \n\nusually 40% to 60% of the total daily insulin requirement. Changes in basal and bolus doses are \n\ncontrolled by means of a small, hand held unit (Personal Pump Communicator (PPC)) which \n\ncommunicates with the pump via radio waves. The detailed operating instructions about the \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\nimplantable pump, its functions and the necessary safety precautions are described in the Physician’s \n\nManual accompanying the infusion pump. \n\n \n\nTime of refill of insulin pump \n\nThe refill procedure should be performed every 40 to 45 days. The time between two refill procedures \n\ncannot exceed 45 days for insulin in-use stability reasons. Patients may require more frequent refill \n\nprocedures based on their insulin needs. \n\n \n\nChange to Insuman Implantable \n\nDose regimen adjustment may be necessary when changing patients from one insulin preparation to \n\nanother. This applies, for example, when changing from: \n\n an animal insulin (especially a bovine insulin) to human insulin,\n\n one human insulin preparation to another,\n\n a regimen with only regular insulin to one with a longer-acting insulin.\nThe need to adjust (e.g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer. \n\nAlternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks. \n\n \n\nFollowing the change from an animal insulin to human insulin, dose reduction may be required in \n\nparticular in patients who: \n\n were already controlled with relatively low blood glucose levels,\n\n have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,\n\n previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.\n\n \n\nClose metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter. \n\nIn patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transition \n\nunder medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered. \n\n \n\nSecondary dose adjustment \n\nImproved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin \n\nrequirement. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if: \n\n the patient's weight changes,\n\n the patient's life-style changes,\n\n other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or \nhyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly population (≥65 years old) \n\nIn the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \n\nmetabolism. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced \n\ncapacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nNo data are available. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of Insuman Implantable (intraperitoneal use) \n\nhave not been established in paediatric patients. In patients who have not reached adult size, Insuman \n\nImplantable is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 4.4). \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Implantable is to be used in the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable pump only. \n\nInsuman Implantable is for intraperitoneal use only. Other routes of administration (e.g. injection) are \n\ncontraindicated. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable has been designed only for intraperitoneal use with the Medtronic MiniMed \n\nImplantable Pump supplied by Medtronic MiniMed which delivers insulin directly into the peritoneal \n\ncavity. \n\nInsuman Implantable must not be used with any other pumps (external or implantable) than the \n\nMedtronic MiniMed Implantable pump or with any other medical devices including syringes (see \n\nsection 6.6). \n\n \n\nPump refill \n\nThe pump refill procedure should be performed using sterile technique and this should take place in \n\nthe centres certified by Medtronic. Reservoir refilling must be performed by trained and qualified \n\npersonnel in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer. The healthcare \n\ninstitution’s standard sterile operating procedures for skin preparation must be followed to avoid \n\nmicrobial contamination and infection. All solutions that will enter the pump must be properly \n\ndegassed prior to filling the pump reservoir to avoid insulin aggregation and under-delivery. The vials \n\nof insulin should be withdrawn from the refrigerator and stored at room temperature in the outer carton \n\nin order to protect from light for a minimum of 4 hours and no longer than 24 hours before use. The \n\ninsulin solution must be then degassed according to the degassing procedure described in the \n\nPhysician’s manual. \n\nIn this refilling procedure the remaining insulin must be removed from the pump and the pump refilled \n\nwith new insulin. The reservoir is completely filled (approximately 15 ml or 6,000 units of Insuman \n\nImplantable), independently of the patients needs. Residual insulin and new insulin must be weighed \n\nto record the refill worksheet and calculate the refill accuracy criterion. For further details on handling \n\nsee section 6.6 and instructions provided in the Physician’s manual. \n\n \n\nRinsing of the pump \n\nAll solutions that will enter the pump must be properly degassed prior to filling the pump reservoir to \n\navoid insulin aggregation and under-delivery. \n\nA rinse procedure using 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution is performed to dissolve insulin deposits \n\nwithin the pump reservoir, pumping mechanism and the side port catheter. It is recommended to \n\nperform the rinse procedure every 6 months. \n\nRinsing may be performed earlier, for example if insulin under-delivery is revealed during a refill \n\nprocedure or suspected due to insufficient blood glucose control. Diagnostic procedures must be \n\nperformed to check if the problem is due to the pump or catheter. \n\n When under-delivery of insulin is due to catheter occlusion, the side port catheter may be \nflushed with 5-10 ml of sterile rinse buffer solution.\n\n When under-delivery is caused by a problem with the pump, a rinse procedure should be \nperformed.\n\nFor further details on handling see section 6.6 and instructions provided in the Physician’s manual. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable is a high-concentrated insulin formulation \n\nInsuman Implantable contains 400 international units of insulin in each ml. \n\nThe label on the insulin vial should be checked before use to make sure this is the correct insulin for \n\nthe intended route of administration. \n\n \n\nPatients should be informed about the high concentration of insulin in Insuman Implantable \n\n(400 IU/ml) compared to other insulins in vials or cartridges (usually 100 IU/ml). \n\n \n\nMixing of insulin \n\nInsuman Implantable must not be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin analogues. \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \n\nInsuman Implantable \n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n\nOther routes of administration (e.g. injection). \n\n \n\nMedtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump \n\nHypersensitivity to titanium alloy, polysulfone or silicone materials used in the implanted components \n\nof the pump. \n\nUse of other insulin medicinal products with the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. \n\nUse in paediatric patients who have not reached adult size due to the large size of the pump (see \n\nsection 4.2 and 4.4). \n\nImplantation of the pump in patients who reside permanently at elevations above 2439 meters \n\n(8000 feet) (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \n\nTraceability \n\nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the \n\nadministered product should be clearly recorded. \n\n \n\nThe Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump should not be implanted in patients who have medical or \n\nmental conditions that make them unable to program modifications to the pump based on glucose \n\nreadings or to take appropriate corrective actions in case of pump system problems. \n\n \n\nPatients implanted with a Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump must receive comprehensive \n\ninstruction in the use of the pump, and the necessary actions in case of illness, hypoglycaemia and \n\nhyperglycaemia or pump failure. The patient should read and follow the instructions in the Patient \n\nManual accompanying the infusion pump. For further details on handling see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nMedical imaging technique \n\nPatients who expect to need frequent or routine MRI or therapeutic ultrasound should not be implanted \n\nwith the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. \n\n \n\nHypersensitivity \n\nPatients hypersensitive to Insuman Implantable for whom no better tolerated preparation is available \n\nmust only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – if necessary – in conjunction with \n\nanti-allergic treatment. \n\n \n\nIn patients with an allergy to animal insulin, intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to \n\nchanging to Insuman Implantable, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions. \n\nIn case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's \n\nadherence to the prescribed treatment regimen and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before \n\ndose adjustment is considered. \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nHypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. \n\n \n\nClinically relevant over-delivery of insulin was not observed during a 4 year period of evaluation of \n\nthe Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump; however, this does not exclude the potential for such an \n\noccurrence. \n\nIn case of severe hypoglycaemia, patients should immediately contact their physician trained to \n\nperform pump investigations and the pump should then be investigated by the physician for possible \n\ncatheter occlusion leading to accumulation of insulin with subsequent release of this accumulated \n\ninsulin (see section 6.6). \n\nDuring a refill procedure, a very small amount of insulin may be deposited subcutaneously, possibly \n\nresulting in hypoglycaemia. Patients must be informed to closely monitor blood glucose levels on \n\nrefill days (see section 6.6). \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n \n\nParticular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in \n\npatients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients \n\nwith significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of \n\ncardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative \n\nretinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following \n\nhypoglycaemia). \n\n \n\nPatients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are \n\ndiminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be \n\nabsent in certain risk groups. These include patients: \n\n in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved,\n\n in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually,\n\n who are elderly,\n\n after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin,\n\n in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present,\n\n with a long history of diabetes,\n\n suffering from a psychiatric illness,\n\n receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).\n\nSuch situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the \n\npatient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, \n\nunrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. \n\n \n\nAdherence of the patient to the dose regimen and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and \n\nawareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors \n\nincreasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may \n\nnecessitate dose adjustment. These include: \n\n improved insulin sensitivity (e.g., by removal of stress factors),\n\n unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity,\n\n intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea),\n\n inadequate food intake,\n\n missed meals,\n\n alcohol consumption,\n\n certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or \nadrenocortical insufficiency),\n\n concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\nIt is known that insulin can form aggregates, fibrils and gel-like structures when it is subjected to \n\nchemical and/or physical stress, e.g. increased temperatures and shaking. This can lead to obstruction \n\nof the implantable pump and under-delivery of insulin. Hyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis or coma may \n\ndevelop within hours in case of malfunction of the pump system. As soon as patients notice a rapid \n\nincrease in blood glucose, which does not respond to a bolus dose of insulin, the possibility of pump \n\nobstruction should be investigated by a physician trained to perform pump investigations. \n\nThe patient should correct resistant hyperglycaemia with a standard dose of subcutaneous insulin. \n\n \n\nRinsing of pump to avoid insulin under-delivery \n\nTo avoid under-delivery which may occur when insulin deposits collect in the pumping mechanism \n\ninside the pump, it is recommended to follow a rinse procedure every 6 months. Rinsing may be \n\nperformed earlier, for example, when potential under-delivery is suspected based on a calculated refill \n\naccuracy of less than 85%. Potential under-delivery of insulin by the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable \n\nPump may result in an increase in daily programmed insulin usage, difficulty maintaining \n\neuglycaemia, refractory hyperglycaemia, and steady decrease in refill accuracy. Please refer to section \n\n6.6 and the Physician’s Manual, which describe how to diagnose potential pump system problems that \n\nmay cause insulin under-delivery, and how to correct and prevent under-delivery. \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nThe majority of adverse reactions associated with the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump can be \n\nprevented by the rinse procedure by physicians. Patients should practice good diabetes self care and \n\ncheck their blood glucose a minimum of 4 times daily to detect and prevent hyperglycemia and \n\npossible diabetic ketoacidosis due to pump under-delivery. \n\nThe patient plays a significant role in diagnosing and correcting hyperglycemia linked to pump \n\nperformance problems. Should pump performance change, the patient would be able to detect a \n\nchange in blood glucose levels. \n\nIn case of malfunction of the pump, patients should always have available injection devices (syringe or \n\npen) and insulin suitable for subcutaneous injection. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nThe Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump is not designed for use at elevations above 2439 meters \n\n(8000 feet) or below 7.6 meters (25 feet). Use of the pump at these altitudes may result in insulin \n\nover-delivery or under-delivery. \n\nPatients who reside permanently at elevations above 2439 meters (8000 feet) must not be implanted \n\n(see section 4.3). \n\nPatients who plan to reside at or travel (other than by pressurised commercial aircraft) at elevations \n\nabove 2439 meters (8000 feet) or to dive below 7.6 meters (25 feet) should be informed on the actions \n\nto be taken. The pump reservoir and Side Port catheter must be emptied of insulin and the patients \n\nmust self-administer insulin by subcutaneous injection for the duration of the trip and until their pump \n\nreservoir is refilled. \n\n \n\nThe patient should be advised by the physician what needs to be done in case of travel, e.g. what to do \n\nif the pump malfunctions, availability of insulin and facility to replace the insulin, and who to contact \n\nin case of emergency. The patient should also be provided with alternative means of supplying insulin, \n\ne.g. provide the patient with 100 IU/ml insulin, devices, and supplies for subcutaneous injections. \n\n \n\nInfection of the pump pocket \n\nAll procedures must be performed under sterile conditions. To avoid microbial contamination and \n\ninfection, aseptic skin preparation should be performed according to the healthcare institution’s \n\nstandard sterile operating procedures. In addition, antibiotic prophylactic measures are required before \n\nand after pump implantation to reduce the risk of pump pocket infection. Failure to do so may result in \n\npump pocket infection and subsequent pump explantation (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nSkin erosion \n\nThe implantable pump may erode through the skin, resulting in infection of the implant site and pump \n\nexplantation. The risk of skin erosion at the pump implantation site can be reduced by selecting an \n\nappropriate implant site, maintaining good sterile technique during the implant procedure, \n\nprophylactic antibiotic therapy and by continuously wearing an abdominal binder until the capsule has \n\nformed (about 1 month) (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAbnormal healing \n\nAbnormal healing can occur at the surgical incision site after device implantation. This can be reduced \n\nby continuously wearing an abdominal binder until the capsule has formed (about 1 month) and \n\nlimiting patient activities immediately following device implant. \n\n \n\nFocal hepatic steatosis \n\nFocal hepatic steatosis has been observed after administration of insulin via the intra-peritoneal route, \n\nwhen the catheter was positioned very close to or in the liver capsule. After stopping insulin infusion \n\nor removal or repositioning of the peritoneal catheter, focal hepatic steatosis seems to be reversible \n\nand without clinical consequence (see section 4.8). \n\n \n\nAntibodies to insulin \n\nThe presence of antibodies has been reported in patients after treatment using the Medtronic MiniMed \n\nImplantable Pump. Insulin administration via the intraperitoneal route is likely to cause formation of \n\nanti-insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the \n\ninsulin dose to correct a tendency for hyper- or hypoglycaemia (see section 4.8). \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\nIntercurrent illness \n\nIntercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases, urine tests for ketones \n\nare indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often \n\nincreased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of \n\ncarbohydrates (food or beverage) on a regular basis; even if they are able to eat only little or no food, \n\nor are vomiting, etc., and they must never omit insulin entirely. \n\n \n\nMedication errors \n\nMedication errors involving mix-up between subcutaneous Insuman formulations or other \n\nsubcutaneous insulins have been reported. Insulin label must always be checked before each \n\nadministration to avoid medication errors between Insuman Implantable and other insulins (see section \n\n6.6). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nDue to the large size of the implantable pump, use of Insuman Implantable in paediatric patients who \n\nhave not reached adult size is contraindicated (see section 4.2 and 4.3). \n\n \n\nSodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \n\nhypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \n\ninhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, \n\npropoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \n\ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e.g. in oral contraceptives), \n\nphenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine \n\n[adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic \n\nmedicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \n\nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. \n\n \n\nPentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \n\nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nPregnancy \n\nFor insulin human administered via subcutaneous route, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are \n\navailable. Insulin does not cross the placental barrier. \n\n \n\nFor Insuman Implantable administered via the intraperitoneal pump, the safety profile has not been \n\nestablished in pregnancy. \n\nWomen of childbearing potential, implanted or candidates for implantation, should inform their \n\nphysician if they are contemplating pregnancy. \n\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Insuman Implantable should not be \n\nused during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with Insuman \n\nImplantable. \n\n \n\nIt is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nthroughout pregnancy. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally \n\nincrease during the second and third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements \n\ndecline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nNo effects on the breastfed child are anticipated. Insuman Implantable can be used during \n\nbreast-feeding. Breast-feeding women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo clinical or animal data with insulin human on male or female fertility are available. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nThe patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or \n\nhyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in \n\nsituations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \n\n \n\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is \n\nparticularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of \n\nhypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is \n\nadvisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \n\nSummary of the safety profile \n\nHypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may occur if the \n\ninsulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. The frequency of this reaction varies \n\nwith patient population and dose regimens. \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nFrom experience gained in a 6-month comparative phase III study (HUBIN_L_05335) with Insuman \n\nImplantable administered via the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump in 84 patients aged 26 to \n\n80 years (see section 5.1) and from clinical experience with insulin human 100 IU/ml and 40 IU/ml, \n\nthe following adverse reactions were observed. \n\n \n\nThe following adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class \n\nand in order of decreasing incidence: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon \n\n(1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be \n\nestimated from the available data). \n\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions observed in HUBIN_L_05335 study with insulin human 400 IU/ml and \n\nclinical experience with insulin human 100 IU/ml and 40 IU/ml. \n\n \n\nMedDRA system \n\norgan classes \n\nCommon Uncommon Not known \n\nImmune system \n\ndisorders \n\n Shock Immediate type \n\nallergic reactions \n\n(hypotension, \n\nangioneurotic oedema, \n\nbronchospasm, \n\ngeneralised skin \n\nreactions); \nAnti-insulin antibodies \n\nMetabolism and \n\nnutrition disorders \n\nHyperglycaemia; \n\nHypoglycaemia; \n\nHypoglycaemic \n\nseizure; \n\nHypoglycaemic \n\nunconsciousness; \n\nketosis; \n\n Sodium retention \n\n \nOedema \n\n \n\nNervous system \n\ndisorders \n\nHypoglycaemic coma   \n\nEye disorders   Proliferative \n\nretinopathy;  \n\nDiabetic retinopathy; \nVisual impairment \n\nHepatobiliary \n\ndisorders \n\n  Focal hepatic \nsteatosis (1) \n\n(1) Adverse reaction observed with a semi-synthetic human insulin (400 IU/ml) \n\n \n\nThe following related adverse reactions have been reported with the use of the Medtronic MiniMed \n\nImplantable Pump in the two phase III studies (see section 5.1). \n\n \n\nTable 2: Adverse reactions and product technical complaints observed with the delivery system \n\n(including adverse reactions related to implantation surgery and or device maintenance). \n\n \nMedDRA system organ classes Common \n\nInfections and infestations Implant site infection (see section 4.4) \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain \n\nUmbilical hernia \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Skin erosion at pump implantation site (see \n\nsection 4.4) \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \n\nconditions \n\nDevice occlusion; \n\nCatheter site pain \n\nSurgical and medicinal procedures Medical device change due to device malfunction \nDevice blockage \n\n \n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions: \n\nImmune system disorders \n\nImmediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nAnti-insulin antibodies: Limited data from a clinical trial with intraperitoneal administration of \n\nInsuman Implantable do not suggest that elevated levels of insulin antibodies are commonly associated \n\nwith insulin antibody syndrome or serious adverse events (see section 4.4). \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n\nSevere hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or \n\nsevere hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. \n\n \n\nIn many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic \n\ncounter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more \n\nmarked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms. \n\n \n\nInsulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is \n\nimproved by intensified insulin therapy. \n\n \n\nEye disorders \n\nA marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary \n\nalteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. \n\nLong-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. \n\nHowever, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be \n\nassociated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. \n\n \n\nHepatobiliary disorders \n\nFocal hepatic steatosis has been reported in few patients receiving the semi-synthetic human insulin, \n\nwhen the catheter was in very close proximity to the liver. \n\nWhen the catheter tip is fixed in the liver capsule, administration of insulin via the intra-peritoneal \n\nroute is associated with an increased risk of focal hepatic steatosis (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nSymptoms \n\nInsulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nManagement \n\nMild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose \n\nregimen of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. \n\n \n\nMore severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with \n\nintramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate \n\nintake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical \n\nrecovery. \n\n \n\nThe physician must program specific limitations for insulin basal insulin rates, bolus delivery \n\namounts. These limitations are necessary to provide some control over patients' ability to program \n\ntheir insulin regimens and to avoid the possibility of overdosing. In addition, if patients are attempting \n\nto deliver more than 2.5 times the programmed maximum bolus amount within a one hour period, the \n\nPPC will display the “HOURLY MAX EXCEEDED” message to warn the patients. Detailed \n\ninstructions on programming these limitations are contained in the Physician’s Manual. \n\n \n\nIn case of severe hypoglycaemia, the pump should be investigated by the treating physician for \n\npossible catheter occlusion leading to accumulation of insulin with subsequent release of this \n\naccumulated insulin (see sections 4.4 and 6.6). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n105 \n \n\nDuring a refill procedure, a very small amount of insulin may be deposited subcutaneously, possibly \n\nresulting in hypoglycaemia. Patients must be informed to closely monitor blood glucose levels on \n\nrefill days (see section 6.6). \n\n \n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting. \n\nATC Code: A10AB01. \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nInsulin \n\n lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects, \n\n increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in the muscles \nand the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation. It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, \n\n increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis, \n\n promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis, \n\n enhances the uptake of potassium into cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nInsuman Implantable is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nA single-blind, randomised, 6-month controlled clinical study (HUBIN_L_05335) was conducted to \n\nevaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Insuman Implantable compared to a semi-synthetic human \n\ninsulin (400 IU/ml) administered via the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. The study included \n\n168 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, previously treated with the semi-synthetic human insulin. \n\nBefore initial pump implantation, 72.4% of these patients had been treated by continuous \n\nsubcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and 17.8% by subcutaneous multi-injection. Reasons for \n\ninitiation of continuous intra-peritoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) were brittle diabetes in 62.7%, \n\nhypoglycaemia in 29.2%, insulin peripheral resistance in 5.0% and hypoglycaemia and brittle diabetes \n\nin 3.1%. At study initiation, half of the patients were switched to Insuman Implantable, while the other \n\nhalf remained on the semi-synthetic human insulin. The co-primary endpoint was change in HbA1c \n\nfrom baseline and the pump refill accuracy after 4 refill cycles (162 ± 21 days). Based on the change \n\nin HbA1c values from baseline, the glycaemic control in patients treated with Insuman Implantable \n\nwas similar to that of patients treated with semi-synthetic human insulin. (per protocol population: \n\n-0.25 versus -0.12; [95% CI: -0.36; 0.11]). In addition, use of Insuman Implantable in continuous \n\nintraperitoneal infusion resulted in stable glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus \n\n(per protocol population: mean reduction: -0.25 ± 0.67; [95% CI: -0.36; 0.11]) without increasing the \n\nrisk of severe hypoglycaemia compared to semi-synthetic human insulin (14.3% versus 13.1%). \n\nInsuman Implantable administered in continuous intraperitoneal infusion was also similar to \n\nsemi-synthetic human insulin as demonstrated by the refill accuracy criteria over the 4-refill cycles \n\n(per protocol population: mean difference: -3.15 ± 1.34; [95% CI: -5.81; -0.50]). \n\n \n\nThere was an additional 12-month open-label randomised controlled study (MIP 310) to assess the \n\neffect of intraperitoneal insulin administration versus subcutaneous insulin administration on \n\nglycaemic control and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. All patients were naive to \n\nintraperitoneal insulin and had failed to improve their HbA1c within 3 months of intensive therapy \n\nwith either multiple daily injection or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Mean HbA1c value at \n\nbaseline was 8.1%. Patients enrolled in the continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion group received \n\nThe semi-synthetic human insulin 400 IU/ml for 180 days followed by Insuman Implantable \n\n400 IU/ml for a further 180 days. Intraperitoneal insulin administration was similar to subcutaneous \n\nadministration as demonstrated by change in HbA1c value from baseline (for continuous \n\nintraperitoneal administration: HbA1c value at Day 360 was 7.78 ± 1.04 versus 8.06 ± 0.77 at \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\nbaseline; for subcutaneous administration: HbA1c value at Day 360 was 8.19 ± 0.87 versus \n\n8.12 ± 0.76 at baseline). \n\n \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nIn literature, insulin pharmacokinetics are generally described to be reproducible in patients with \n\ntype 1 diabetes mellitus receiving short-term and long-term continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion. \n\nContinuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion results in earlier, shorter and higher peaks of plasma free \n\ninsulin than continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes \n\nmellitus. \n\nContinuous infusion via the intraperitoneal and intravenous routes (combined data) resulted in higher \n\nplasma free insulin Cmax values than multiple daily subcutaneous injections and continuous \n\nsubcutaneous insulin infusion via an external pump (combined data) in patients with type 1 diabetes \n\nmellitus. \n\nAll of the findings suggest that continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion in patients with type 1 \n\ndiabetes mellitus, compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily \n\ninjections is more similar to the pharmacokinetics of endogenous insulin observed. \n\n \n\nNo food effect is expected on Cmax, Tmax and AUC values following CIPII administration. \n\n \n\nIn a phase III study (HUBIN_L_05335) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the pharmacokinetic \n\nprofile of Insuman Implantable after intraperitoneal administration of an insulin bolus was assessed in \n\n10 patients after intraperitoneal administration. \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nAfter intraperitoneal administration of Insuman Implantable 0.15 IU/kg, the median Tmax was \n\n0.54 hours and Cmax in serum was 210 ± 129 microIU/ml. \n\nThe mean pharmacokinetic profile is shown in figure 1. \n \n\n \n200 \n\n \n\n \n\n150 \n\n \n\n \n\n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n0 1 2 3 4 \n\nTIME - hour \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Mean pharmacokinetic profile of serum insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus after \n\na dose of 0.15 IU/kg Insuman Implantable. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nAfter intraperitoneal administration of 0.15 IU/kg Insuman Implantable, insulin was eliminated from \n\nserum with an apparent mean half-life of 2.7 hours. \n\nIN\nS\n\nU\nL\n\nIN\n C\n\nO\nN\n\nC\n -\n\n µ\nIU\n\n/m\nl \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n\n \n\nAcute toxicity of insulin human was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats. No \n\nevidence of toxic effects was found. \n\nNo non-clinical studies assessing the potential toxicity of Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml \n\nadministered via intraperitoneal route were performed. However, three studies were conducted in rats \n\nto assess the potential toxicity of administration of human insulin via the intraperitoneal route. In a \n\nsingle-dose study in rats, a semi-synthetic insulin human in a formulation with 400 IU/ml and \n\nexcipients identical to the Insuman Implantable 400 IU/ml formulation was administered by \n\nintraperitoneal injection. No clinical symptoms, macroscopically visible changes or irritations in the \n\nabdominal cavity were observed. In another study, rats also received the same semi-synthetic insulin \n\nvia an intraperitoneally implanted osmotic mini-pump infusion for up to 6 weeks. No hepatic steatosis \n\nwas observed. In a third study conducted in diabetic rats, administration of another human insulin with \n\na formulation similar to Insuman via a catheter fixed to the liver capsule showed that intraperitoneal \n\nadministration of high local insulin concentration at the liver capsule may induce reversible focal \n\nhepatic steatosis. \n\n \n \n\n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n6.1 List of excipients \n \n\nPhenol, \n\nzinc chloride, \n\ntrometamol, \n\npoloxamer 171, \n\nglycerol, \n\nhydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), \n\nsodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), \n\nwater for injections \n\n \n\n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \n\nThis medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. \n\n \n\nMixing of insulins \n\nInsuman Implantable must NOT be mixed with any other insulin or with insulin analogues. \n\nCare must be taken to ensure that no alcohol or other disinfectants enter the insulin solution. \n\n6.3 Shelf life \n \n\n2 years. \n\n \n\nShelf life in the pump \n\nUp to 45 days at 37°C. \n\n \n\n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). \n\nDo not freeze. \n\nDo not put Insuman Implantable next to the freezer compartment or a freezer pack. \n\nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nShelf life in the pump \n\nFor in-use stability, see section 6.3. \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \n\nColourless glass vial (type I) closed with flanged cap made of aluminium with tear-off lid and inserted \n\nsealing disk made of chlorobutyl rubber. \n\nEach vial contains 10 ml of solution. \n\nPacks of 1 and 5 vials. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. \n\n \n\n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \n\nThe solution must only be used if it is clear, colourless or almost colourless and practically free from \n\nvisible particles. \n\n \n\nInsulin label must always be checked before each administration to avoid medication errors between \n\nInsuman Implantable and other insulins (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable must not be used with any other pumps (external or implantable) than the \n\nMedtronic MiniMed Implantable pump or with any other medical devices including syringes (see \n\nsection 4.2). \n\n \n\nAll procedures should be performed using sterile technique. Aseptic skin preparation should be \n\nperformed according to the healthcare institution’s standard sterile operating procedures to avoid \n\nmicrobial contamination and infection. Failure to do so may result in pump pocket infection and \n\nsubsequent pump explantation (see section 4.4). \n\n \n\nAll solutions that will enter the pump must be properly degassed prior to filling the pump reservoir to \n\navoid insulin aggregation and under-delivery.The vials of insulin should be withdrawn from the \n\nrefrigerator and stored at room temperature in the outer carton in order to protect from light for a \n\nminimum of 4 hours and no longer than 24 hours before use, to ensure further efficient degassing by \n\nfollowing the procedure described in the Physician’s manual. Failure to properly degas all fluids may \n\nintroduce air in the pump causing insulin aggregation and under-delivery. \n\n \n\nPump refill \n\nThe pump reservoir stores about 6,000 units of insulin and requires a refill procedure every 40 to \n\n45 days for insulin in-use stability reasons in the pump or earlier based on the insulin needs of the \n\npatients. \n\n \n\nThis procedure should always be scheduled in advance of PPC “low reservoir” or “empty reservoir” \n\nmessages with the patient. \n\n \n\nOnly Insuman Implantable which has been specifically formulated for use in the Medtronic MiniMed \n\nImplantable Pump should be used to fill the sterile pump reservoir. Two vials of Insuman Implantable \n\n(2 x 10 ml) are required to completely refill the pump reservoir and exclude air from entering the \n\npump reservoir during the refill procedure. Any unused insulin should be disposed of in accordance \n\nwith local requirements and should not be reused. \n\n \n\nOnly the refill kit (syringe and stopcock), refill needles, port locating template supplied by Medtronic \n\nMiniMed and sterile rinse buffer solution manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH should \n\nbe used with Insuman Implantable to refill the pump reservoir. \n\n \n\nDuring a refill procedure, never push in the refill syringe plunger to fill the pump. When the refill \n\nneedle is properly seated in the pump fill port, then the vacuum in the pump reservoir will passively \n\ndraw the insulin from the syringe into the pump reservoir. Failure of the insulin to enter the pump may \n\nindicate that the pump reservoir is still full. It may also indicate that the refill needle is not properly \n\nseated in the pump inlet valve. Pushing insulin in this circumstance could result in unintended insulin \n\ndelivery to the subcutaneous tissue around the pump fill port. \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\nDuring a refill procedure, a very small amount of insulin may be deposited subcutaneously, possibly \n\nresulting in hypoglycemia. Patients must be informed to closely monitor blood glucose levels on refill \n\ndays. \n\n \n\nDuring the refill procedure it is important to fill out the refill worksheet and to calculate refill accuracy \n\nto evaluate system function. A calculated refill accuracy of less than 85% is indicative of insulin \n\nunder-delivery. \n\nDetailed instructions on the refill procedure are contained in the Physician’s Manual. \n\nInsulin under-delivery \n\nInsulin under-delivery is suspected when: \n\n The patient reports an increase in insulin use to maintain euglycaemia. This can be verified by \n\nchecking the insulin daily history on the PPC at each visit. \n\n Refractory hyperglycaemia occurs. \n\n A refill accuracy of less than 85% is calculated during a refill procedure. \n\nIf insulin under-delivery is revealed during a refill procedure or suspected due to insufficient blood \n\nglucose control, diagnostic procedures must be performed to check if the problem is due to the pump \n\n(i.e. jammed pumping mechanism/backflow) or catheter (i.e. catheter occlusion). The stroke volume \n\nmeasurement procedure tests pump function, while a catheter flush procedure tests catheter patency. A \n\nstroke volume of between 0.42 μl to 0.58 μl without backflow is indicative of a catheter occlusion. \n\nOtherwise stroke volume values outside this range or the detection of backflow is indicative of a pump \n\nproblem. \n\n \n\nUnder-delivery of insulin caused by catheter occlusion \n\nUnder-delivery caused by Side Port Catheter occlusion can occur either abruptly or gradually. The \n\ninsulin usage and clinical symptoms may be identical to those of pump under-delivery. In addition, \n\nformation of a biofilm over the tip of the Side Port Catheter may cause latent hypoglycemia as the \n\ninsulin programmed over time is trapped in the biofilm and is released after a sufficient volume of \n\ninsulin has accumulated. A catheter flush procedure should be performed to clear the occlusion. \n\n \n\nThe catheter is flushed by using 5-10 ml of sterile rinse buffer solution. \n\nOnly the refill kit (syringe and stopcock), refill needles, port locating template supplied by Medtronic \n\nMiniMed and sterile rinse buffer solution manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH should \n\nbe used with Insuman Implantable to flush the catheter. \n\n \n\nThe catheter flush procedure should only be performed after confirming the stroke volume \n\nmeasurement. Failure to do this may cause permanent damage to the pump. \n\n \n\nDuring the catheter flush procedure 13 units of insulin are manually pushed through the catheter and \n\ndelivered to the patient. The patient must be closely monitored for possible hypoglycaemia and \n\nadministered intravenous glucose or glycogen as needed. \n\n \n\nAfter flushing and refill of the pump with insulin, about 13 units of the sterile rinse buffer solution will \n\nremain in the distal portion of the side port catheter. Depending on blood glucose values, an \n\nappropriate bolus amount must be programmed to remove the sterile rinse buffer solution from the \n\ncatheter. The patient blood glucose levels must be monitored at least every 15 minutes following the \n\nflush. The patient should only be released once blood glucose levels are stable and within the safe \n\nrange. \n\n \n\nIf the flush procedure is unsuccessful, catheter replacement surgery is usually performed. \n\nDetailed instructions on the side port catheter flush procedure is contained in the Physician’s Manual. \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\nUnder-delivery due to a problem with the pump \n\nA rinse procedure of the pump is performed to reverse this condition. \n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to dissolve insulin deposits within the pump reservoir, pumping \n\nmechanism and the side port catheter using 0.1 M sodium hydroxide sterile solution supplied by \n\nMedtronic MiniMed. It is recommended to perform the rinse procedure every 6 months or as \n\nnecessary based on the refill accuracy criterion. \n\n \n\nOnly refill kit, refill needles, port locating template, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide sterile solution supplied \n\nby Medtronic MiniMed and sterile rinse buffer solution manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland \n\nGmbH should be used with Insuman Implantable to rinse the pump. \n\n \n\nIf the rinse procedure fails to restore the stroke volume and accurate delivery, an extended rinse \n\nprocedure needs to be performed. \n\n \n\nOnly after successful restoration of the stroke volume measurement can the catheter be flushed with \n\nthe sterile rinse buffer solution and the pump refilled with insulin. \n\nDetailed instructions on the rinse procedure are contained in the Physician’s Manual. \n\n \n \n\n7.

What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating hyperglycaemic coma \n\n(coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the \n\nbody is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and \n\nafter surgery. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n217 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n218 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \nisoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n219 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Rapid \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein \n\n(blood vessel). \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires \n\nexperience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar \n\nsetting. \n\n \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps – special insulin preparations are available for use in such \n\ndevices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and \n\nhas a water-like consistency. \n\n \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to \n\nmeasure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \n\nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \n\ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed \n\nfor use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. \n\n\n\n220 \n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw Insuman Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. Inject as soon as you \n\nhave mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per \n\nml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Rapid than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Rapid \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For \n\ninformation on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Rapid \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nRapid and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n221 \n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Rapid \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \n\nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heartbeat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\n\n\n225 \n \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n226 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 40 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating hyperglycaemic coma \n\n(coma caused by too much blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the \n\nbody is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and \n\nafter surgery. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n227 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n228 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n229 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Rapid \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein \n\n(blood vessel). \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nInsulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires \n\nexperience and special safety precautions. For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar \n\nsetting. \n\n \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps – special insulin preparations are available for use in such \n\ndevices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and \n\nhas a water-like consistency. \n\n \n\nDo not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to \n\nmeasure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \n\nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \n\ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed \n\nfor use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. \n\n\n\n230 \n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw Insuman Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin. Inject as soon as you \n\nhave mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per \n\nml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Rapid than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Rapid \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Rapid \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nRapid and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not know (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not know \n\n\n\n231 \n \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\n\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help  prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Rapid \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \n\nafter “EXP”.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n234 \n \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n\n\n235 \n \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n236 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. The instructions for using the insulin pen are provided with your \n\ninsulin pen. Refer to them before using your medicine. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see \n\nalso section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n237 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions orhigh \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n238 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n239 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Rapid \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such \n\ndevices. Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see \n\nalso section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Rapid cartridges are to be used only with the \n\nfollowing pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \n\nmanufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. \n\n \n\nLook at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid \n\nparticles visible, and has a water-like consistency. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \n\nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix Insuman Rapid with any other medicines. \n\n\n\n240 \n \n\nProblems with the pen? \n\n \n\nRefer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Rapid than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Rapid \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Rapid \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nRapid and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heartbeat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n\n\n241 \n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Rapid \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \n\ncartridge after “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened cartridges \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Rapid next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nIn-use cartridges \n\nCartridges in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not \n\nabove 25°C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct \n\nsunlight or next to a lamp). The cartridge in-use must not be stored in a refrigerator. Do not use the \n\ncartridge after this time period. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n\n\n245 \n \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n246 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid Solostar 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Insuman Rapid SoloStar, \n\npre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for \n\nyou. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid \n3. How to use Insuman Rapid \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Insuman Rapid \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Rapid is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Rapid contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. It comes in \n\ncartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Rapid \n\nDo not use Insuman Rapid \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Rapid. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\n\n\n247 \n \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Rapid). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n\n\n\n248 \n \n\n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n\n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast feeding think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, \n\nask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your \n\nbabyHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n249 \n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Rapid \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin. \n\n \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Rapid in pre-filled pen is \n\nonly suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use \n\nthe pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for \n\nuse with SoloStar. \n\n \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nLook at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use Insuman Rapid if you notice particles in it. \n\nOnly use Insuman Rapid if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \n\nthink you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n\n\n250 \n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Rapid Solostar pre-filled pen, is not designed to \n\nallow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar \n\nhas to be used. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Rapid than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Rapid \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Rapid \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Rapid without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nRapid and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n251 \n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n\n\n255 \n \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Rapid\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n256 \n \n\n \n \n\nInsuman Rapid SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a \n\nperson who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \n\naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \n\nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call \n\nthe local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \nwith SoloStar.\n\n Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n\n Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3).\n\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n\n Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.\n\n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is \nwhite with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the \n\nformulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \n\nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \n\nC. Check the appearance of your insulin. \nIf you are using clear insulin (Insuman Rapid), do not use this pen if the insulin is cloudy, \n\ncoloured or has particles. \n\n\n\n257 \n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nBefore use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. \n\nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending \non the needle type). \n\n \n\n. \n\n If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n ensuring that pen and needle work properly\n\n removing air bubbles\n\n \n\nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nB.  Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \ninner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n\n \n\nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \n\nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n258 \n \n\n \n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n\n \n\n If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them.\n\n If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.\n\n If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar.\n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA. Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. \n \n\nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n\n Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.\n \n\n You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.\n\n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n\nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n \n\nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \nwill return to “0” as you inject. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n259 \n \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the \n\ntotal of 300 units of insulin has been used. \n\n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n Contamination and/or infection\n\n Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.\n\n \n\nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n \n\n If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \n\nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases.\n\n \n\nB. Dispose of the needle safely. \n \n\nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n\n \n\nStorage instructions \n\n \n\nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to \n\nroom temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid \n\nsituations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, \n\nuse a new one. \n\n\n\n260 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for. \n \n\nInsuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is \n\npresent as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment \n\nwith insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control \n\nthe level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal \n\nDo not use Insuman Basal \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n261 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n262 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n263 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Basal \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nBasal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other \n\nsubstances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin \n\nhuman preparations as detailed below. \n\n\n\n264 \n \n\nInsuman Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed \n\nfor use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparation. If you need to inject a mixture, \n\ndraw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Basal. Inject as soon as you have \n\nmixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Basal than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Basal \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Basal \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nBasal and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n265 \n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antobodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Basal \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \n\nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Basal next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nOpened vials \n\nOnce in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25°C and \n\naway from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a \n\nlamp). Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be \n\nnoted on the label. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n\n\n269 \n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n270 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal \n3. How to use Insuman Basal \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Insuman Basal \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is \n\npresent as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment \n\nwith insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control \n\nthe level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal \n\nDo not use Insuman Basal \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n271 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n272 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n273 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Basal \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other \n\nsubstances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin \n\nhuman preparations as detailed below. \n\n\n\n274 \n \n\nInsuman Basal may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed \n\nfor use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Basal. Inject as soon as you \n\nhave mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per \n\nml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Basal than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Basal \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Basal \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nBasal and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n275 \n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Basal \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \n\nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Basal next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nOpened vials \n\nOnce in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25°C and \n\naway from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a \n\nlamp). Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be \n\nnoted on the label. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n\n\n279 \n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n280 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. The instructions for using the insulin pen are provided with your \n\ninsulin pen. Refer to them before using your medicine. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal \n3. How to use Insuman Basal \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Insuman Basal \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Basal is and what is it used for \n \n\nInsuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is \n\npresent as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment \n\nwith insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control \n\nthe level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal \n\nDo not use Insuman Basal \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see \n\nalso section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\n\n\n281 \n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\n\n\n282 \n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n\n\n283 \n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Basal \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Basal cartridges are to be used only with the \n\nfollowing pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \n\nmanufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin \n\nwell and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \n\nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n\n\n284 \n \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \n\nthen be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \n\nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \n\nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\n- Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.Do not re-fill and re-use \n\nempty cartridges. \n\n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n\n \n\nProblems with the pen? \n\n \nRefer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Basal than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Basal \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Basal \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nBasal and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n\n\n285 \n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\n\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Basal \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \n\ncartridge after “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened cartridges \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Basal next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n286 \n \n\nIn-use cartridges \n\nCartridges in-use (in the insulin pen) or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not \n\nabove 25°C and away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct \n\nsunlight or next to a lamp). The cartridge in-use must not be stored in a refrigerator. Do not use the \n\ncartridge after this time period. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n289 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n290 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Insuman Basal SoloStar, \n\npre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for \n\nyou. \n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Basal is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Basal contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. The insulin is \n\npresent as tiny crystals of insulin protamine. It comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, \n\nSoloStar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need treatment \n\nwith insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control \n\nthe level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Basal \n\nDo not use Insuman Basal \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Basal. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\n\n\n291 \n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Basal). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Basal \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n\n\n292 \n \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n\n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal \n\n \n\n\n\n293 \n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Basal \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Basal in pre-filled pen is \n\nonly suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use \n\nthe pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for \n\nuse with SoloStar. \n\n \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \n\ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \n\nmust then be used. \n\n\n\n294 \n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \n\nthink you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Basal SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not designed to \n\nallow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar \n\nhas to be used. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Basal than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Basal \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your \nblood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. \n\nFor information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Basal \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Basal without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nBasal and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n\n\n295 \n \n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Basal \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the pen \n\nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nNot in-use pens \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put the pre-filled pen next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from \n\nlight. \n\n \n\nIn-use pens \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n296 \n \n\nPre-filled pens in-use or carried as a spare may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks not above 25°C \n\nand away from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to \n\na lamp). The pen in-use must not be stored in a refrigerator. Do not use the pen after this time period. \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n299 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Basal\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n300 \n \n\n \n \n\nInsuman Basal SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a \n\nperson who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \n\naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \n\nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call \n\nthe local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \nwith SoloStar.\n\n Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n\n Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3).\n\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n\n Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.\n\n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is \nwhite with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the \n\nformulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \n\nB. Take off the pen cap. \n\n\n\n301 \n \n\nC. Check the appearance of your insulin. \nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and \n\ndown at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the \n\ncartridge. \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly \n\nmilky-white appearance. \n\n \n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nBefore use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. \n\nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending \non the needle type). \n\n \n\n. \n\n If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n ensuring that pen and needle work properly\n\n removing air bubbles\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n302 \n \n\nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \ninner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n\n \n\nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \n\nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n\n \n\n If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them.\n\n If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.\n\n If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar.\n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA. Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. \n \n\nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n303 \n \n\n Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.\n \n\n You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.\n\n \n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n\nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n \n\nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \nwill return to “0” as you inject. \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the \n\ntotal of 300 units of insulin has been used. \n\n \n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n Contamination and/or infection\n\n Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.\n\n \n\nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n \n\n If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \n\nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases.\n\n \n\nB. Dispose of the needle safely. \n \n\nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n304 \n \n\nStorage instructions \n\n \n\nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up at \n\nroom temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid \n\nsituations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, \n\nuse a new one. \n\n\n\n305 \n \n\nPackage leaflet:Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 15. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n306 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 15). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb°15 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n307 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n\n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 15 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 15 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n308 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 15. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n309 \n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \n\nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \n\ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially \n\ndesigned for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin \n\nanalogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 15. Inject as soon as \n\nyou have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU \n\nper ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 15 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 15, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 15 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 15 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 15 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 15 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reporting with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n\n\n310 \n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reporting with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb°15\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n314 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb°15\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n315 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. The instructions for using the insulin pen are provided with your \n\ninsulin pen. Refer to them before using your medicine. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen \n\n(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 15. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\n\n\n316 \n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 15). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 15 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\n\n\n317 \n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 15 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\n\n\n318 \n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 15 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 15. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 15 cartridges are to be used only with the \n\nfollowing pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \n\nmanufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin \n\nwell and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \n\nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\n\n\n319 \n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \n\nthen be used. \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \n\nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \n\nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \n\nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n\n \n\nProblems with the pen? \n\n \nRefer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 15 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 15, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 15 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 15 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 15 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 15 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n\n\n320 \n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\n\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 15\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n324 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 15\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage.Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n325 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar, \n\npre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for \n\nyou. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 15 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. It comes \n\nin cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 15. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\n\n\n326 \n \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 15). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 15 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n\n\n\n327 \n \n\n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n\n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 15 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 15 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n328 \n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 15 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 15 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 15. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 15 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 15 in pre-filled pen is \n\nonly suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use \n\nthe pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for \n\nuse with SoloStar. \n\n \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \n\ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \n\nmust then be used. \n\n\n\n329 \n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \n\nthink you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 15 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, SoloStar, is \n\nnot designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar \n\nhas to be used. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 15 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 15, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 15 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 15 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 15 \n\n \nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 15 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 15 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body),\n\n\n\n330 \n \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effectsreported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 15\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n334 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb°15\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n335 \n \n\n \n \n\nInsuman Comb 15 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a \n\nperson who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \n\naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \n\nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call \n\nthe local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \nwith SoloStar.\n\n Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n\n Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3).\n\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n\n Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.\n\n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is \nwhite with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the \n\nformulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \n\nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \n\nC. Check the appearance of your insulin. \nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and \n\ndown at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the \n\ncartridge. \n\n\n\n336 \n \n\n \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly \n\nmilky-white appearance. \n\n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nBefore use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. \n\nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending \non the needle type). \n\n \n\n. \n\n If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n ensuring that pen and needle work properly\n\n removing air bubbles\n \n\nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \ninner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n337 \n \n\n \n \n\nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \n\nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n\n \n\n If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them.\n\n If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.\n\n If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar.\n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA. Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. \n \n\nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n\n Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.\n \n\n You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.\n\n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n338 \n \n\nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n \n\nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \nwill return to “0” as you inject. \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the \n\ntotal of 300 units of insulin has been used. \n\n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n Contamination and/or infection\n\n Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.\n\n \n\nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n \n\n If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \n\nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases.\n\n \n\nB. Dispose of the needle safely. \n \n\nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n\n \n \n\nStorage instructions \n\n \n\nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up at \n\nroom temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n339 \n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid \n\nsituations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, \n\nuse a new one. \n\n\n\n340 \n \n\nPackage leaflet Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n341 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n342 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n343 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb°25 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other \n\nsubstances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin \n\nhuman preparations as detailed below. \n\n\n\n344 \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially \n\ndesigned for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin \n\nanalogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 25. Inject as soon as \n\nyou have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU \n\nper ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 25 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 25 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\n\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n345 \n \n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\n\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n349 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n350 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet.

What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n351 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n352 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n353 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other \n\nsubstances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin \n\nhuman preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\n\n\n354 \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially \n\ndesigned for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin \n\nanalogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 25. Inject as soon as \n\nyou have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU \n\nper ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 25 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 25 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n \n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body),\n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n\n\n355 \n \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\n\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\n\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n359 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n360 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen \n\n(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\n\n\n361 \n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n\n\n362 \n \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\n\n\n363 \n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 25 cartridges are to be used only with the \n\nfollowing pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \n\nmanufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin \n\nwell and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \n\nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \n\n\n\n364 \n \n\nthen be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \n\nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \n\nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \n\nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n\n \n\nProblems with the pen? \n\n \nRefer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 25 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 25 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n\n\n\n\n365 \n \n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\n\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\n\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Comb 25 \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \n\ncartridge after “EXP”.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n369 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n370 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar, \n\npre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for \n\nyou. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 25 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. It comes \n\nin cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 25. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\n\n\n371 \n \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 25). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n\n\n\n372 \n \n\n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n\n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 25 in pregnant women. \n\n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 25 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n373 \n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 25 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 25. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 25 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 25 in pre-filled pen is \n\nonly suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use \n\nthe pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for \n\nuse with SoloStar. \n\n \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \n\ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \n\nmust then be used. \n\n\n\n374 \n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \n\nthink you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 25 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not \n\ndesigned to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar \n\nhas to be used. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 25 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 25, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 25 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 25 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 25 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 25 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 25 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body),\n\n\n\n375 \n \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n379 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 25\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n380 \n \n\n \n \n\nInsuman Comb 25 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a \n\nperson who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \n\naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \n\nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call \n\nthe local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \nwith SoloStar.\n\n Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n\n Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3).\n\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n\n Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.\n\n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is \nwhite with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the \n\nformulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \n\nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \n\nC. Check the appearance of your insulin. \nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and \n\ndown at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the \n\ncartridge. \n\n\n\n381 \n \n\n \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly \n\nmilky-white appearance. \n\n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nBefore use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. \n\nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending \non the needle type). \n\n \n\n. \n\n If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n ensuring that pen and needle work properly\n\n removing air bubbles\n \n\nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \ninner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n382 \n \n\n \n \n\nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \n\nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n\n \n\n If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them.\n\n If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.\n\n If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar.\n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA. Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. \n \n\nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n\n Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.\n \n\n You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.\n\n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n383 \n \n\nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n \n\nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \nwill return to “0” as you inject. \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the \n\ntotal of 300 units of insulin has been used. \n\n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n Contamination and/or infection\n\n Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.\n\n \n\nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n \n\n If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \n\nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases.\n\n \n\nB. Dispose of the needle safely. \n \n\nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n \n\nStorage instructions \n\n \n\nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to \n\nroom temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n384 \n \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\n \n\nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid \n\nsituations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, \n\nuse a new one. \n\n\n\n385 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 30 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 30. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n386 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 30). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 30 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n387 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 30 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 30 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n388 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 30 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 30. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other \n\nsubstances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with insulin \n\nhuman preparations as detailed below. \n\n\n\n389 \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially \n\ndesigned for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin \n\nanalogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 30. Inject as soon as \n\nyou have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU \n\nper ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 30 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 30, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 30 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 30 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 30 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 30 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n\n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\n\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n390 \n \n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\n\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 30\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n394 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 30\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n395 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. The instructions for using the insulin pen are provided with your \n\ninsulin pen. Refer to them before using your medicine. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 30 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen \n\n(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 30. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n\n\n396 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 30). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 30 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n397 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 30 in pregnant women. \n\n \nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 30 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n398 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 30 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 30. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 30 cartridges are to be used only with the \n\nfollowing pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \n\nmanufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin \n\nwell and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \n\nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \n\nthen be used. \n\n\n\n399 \n \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \n\nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \n\nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \n\nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n\n \n\nProblems with the pen? \n\n \nRefer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 30 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 30, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 30 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 30 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 30 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 30 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n\n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\n\n\n400 \n \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site\n\nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Comb 30 \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \n\ncartridge after “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened cartridges \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Comb 30 next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 30\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n404 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 30\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n405 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar, \n\npre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for \n\nyou. \n\n- Keep this leaflet.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 30 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action. It comes \n\nin cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 30. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\n\n\n406 \n \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 30). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 30 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n\n\n\n407 \n \n\n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n\n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 30 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 30 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n408 \n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 30 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 30 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 30. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is injected under the skin 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 30 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 30 in pre-filled pen is \n\nonly suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use \n\nthe pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for \n\nuse with SoloStar. \n\n \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \n\ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \n\nmust then be used. \n\n\n\n409 \n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \n\nthink you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 30 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not \n\ndesigned to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar \n\nhas to be used. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 30 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 30, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 30 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 30 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 30 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 30 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 30 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body),\n\n\n\n410 \n \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Comb 30 \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the pen \n\nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nNot in-use pens \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 30\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n414 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 30\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n2. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \n\nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n415 \n \n\n \n \n\nInsuman Comb 30 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a \n\nperson who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \n\naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \n\nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call \n\nthe local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \nwith SoloStar.\n\n Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n\n Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3).\n\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n\n Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.\n\n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar \nis white with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the \n\nformulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \n\nB Take off the pen cap. \n \n\nC Check the appearance of your insulin. \nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and \n\ndown at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the \n\ncartridge. \n\n\n\n416 \n \n\n \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly \n\nmilky-white appearance. \n\n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nBefore use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. \n\nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending \non the needle type). \n\n \n\n. \n\n If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n ensuring that pen and needle work properly\n\n removing air bubbles\n \n\nA Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nB Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off \nthe inner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n417 \n \n\n \n \n\nC Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \n\nE Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n\n \n\n If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them.\n\n If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.\n\n If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar.\n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. \n \n\nB Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n\n Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.\n \n\n You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.\n\n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n418 \n \n\nB Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n \n\nC Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose \nwindow will return to “0” as you inject. \n\n \n \n\nD Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total \n\nof 300 units of insulin has been used. \n\n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n Contamination and/or infection\n\n Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.\n\n \n\nA Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n \n\n If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \n\nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases.\n\n \n\nB Dispose of the needle safely. \n \n\nC Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n \n\nStorage instructions \n\n \n\nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to \n\nroom temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n419 \n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid \n\nsituations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, \n\nuse a new one. \n\n\n\n420 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for \n\n \nInsuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n\n\n421 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n422 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n423 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 contains 100 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (100 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n\n\n424 \n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \n\nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \n\ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially \n\ndesigned for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin \n\nanalogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 50. Inject as soon as \n\nyou have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU \n\nper ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 50 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 50 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n\n\n425 \n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\n\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\n\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \n\n\n\n429 \n \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n430 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 40 IU/ml suspension for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for \n\nInsuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n1. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n\n\n431 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n\n\n\n432 \n \n\n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n\n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n433 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 contains 40 IU insulin per ml. Only injection syringes designed for this insulin \n\nconcentration (40 IU per ml) must be used. The injection syringes must not contain any other \n\nmedicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin). \n\n \n\nBefore the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well immediately before each injection. This is best done by rolling the vial tilted \n\nbetween the palms of the hands. Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and \n\ncause froth to form. Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the vial. A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This \n\nis because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem \n\nwith your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or \n\nother substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix insulin with any other medicines except with \n\ninsulin human preparations as detailed below. \n\n\n\n434 \n \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 may be mixed with all insulin human preparations, EXCEPT those specially \n\ndesigned for use in insulin pumps. Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin \n\nanalogues. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will tell you if you have to mix insulin human preparations. If you need to inject a \n\nmixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Comb 50. Inject as soon as \n\nyou have mixed them. Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU \n\nper ml). \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 50 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 50 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n\n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\n\n\n435 \n \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \n\n\n\n439 \n \n\nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n440 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen \n\n(see also section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor \n\n\n\n441 \n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n\n\n442 \n \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n\n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\n\n\n443 \n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nDo not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps – special insulin preparations are available for \n\nuse in such devices. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\nTo ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insuman Comb 50 cartridges are to be used only with the \n\nfollowing pens: \n\n- JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units \n- ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. \nNot all of these pens may be marketed in your country. \n\n \n\nThe pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. The \n\nmanufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, \n\nattaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen. Mix the insulin \n\nwell and check it before you insert it into the pen. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the cartridge or pen (with the cartridge in it) back and forth at \n\nleast 10 times. To assist in mixing, three tiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge. A new cartridge with a uniform suspension on mixing must \n\n\n\n444 \n \n\nthen be used. \n\n \n\nAlways use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. \n\nThis is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a \n\nproblem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). Make sure that neither \n\nalcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. \n- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines. \n\n \n\nProblems with the pen? \n\n \nRefer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. \n\nIf the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be \n\ndiscarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. \n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 50 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 50 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n\n\n\n\n445 \n \n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\n\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\n\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n449 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n450 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 Solostar 100 IU/ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully including the Instructions for Use of Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar, \n\npre-filled pen, before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for \n\nyou. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Comb 50 is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and moderately long duration of action. \n\nIt comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, SoloStar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDo not use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). \n\nSpeak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Comb 50. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\n\n\n451 \n \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Comb 50). Contact your doctor \n\nif you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, needles etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n\n\n\n452 \n \n\n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n\n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Comb 50 in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Comb 50 \n\n \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n\n\n453 \n \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Comb 50 per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Comb 50. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nFrequency of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is injected under the skin 20 to 30 minutes before a meal. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\nDo NOT inject Insuman Comb 50 into a vein (blood vessel). \n\nSoloStar delivers insulin in doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin. With each \n\ninjection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. \n\n \n\nHow to handle SoloStar \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin human. Insuman Comb 50 in pre-filled pen is \n\nonly suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by \n\nanother method. \n\n \n\nRead carefully the \"SoloStar Instructions for Use\" included in this package leaflet. You must use \n\nthe pen as described in these Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nA new injection needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for \n\nuse with SoloStar. \n\n \n\nA safety test must be performed before each injection. \n\n \n\nMix the insulin well and check it before first use. Later, you must mix the insulin well again \n\nimmediately before each injection. \n\n \n\nMixing is best done by gently tilting the pen back and forth at least 10 times. To assist in mixing, three \n\ntiny metal balls are present in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nAfter mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky-white appearance. It must not be used if it \n\nremains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or \n\non the sides or bottom of the cartridge in the pen. A new pen with a uniform suspension on mixing \n\nmust then be used. \n\n\n\n454 \n \n\nAlways use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you \n\nthink you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nTo prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nMake sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Comb 50 SoloStar, pre-filled pen, is not \n\ndesigned to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge. \n\n \n\nEmpty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded. \n\n \n\nDo not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new SoloStar \n\nhas to be used. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Comb 50 than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Comb 50, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Comb 50 \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Comb 50 or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Comb 50 \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Comb 50 \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nComb 50 and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body),\n\n\n\n455 \n \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. \n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n\n\n459 \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Comb 50\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners \n\n(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n\n\n\n460 \n \n\n \n \n\nInsuman Comb 50 SoloStar suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen. Instructions for Use. \n\n \n\nSoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is \n\nappropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or \n\nnurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. \n\n \n\nRead these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or \n\nfollow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from a \n\nperson who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To \n\nensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the \n\ndosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. \n\n \n\nFollow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an \n\naccurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too \n\nlittle insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. \n\n \n\nYou can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. \n\nKeep this leaflet for future reference. \n\nIf you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or call \n\nthe local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSchematic diagram of the pen \n\nImportant information for use of SoloStar: \n\n \n\n Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that have been approved for use \nwith SoloStar.\n\n Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached.\n\n Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3).\n\n This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.\n\n If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid \naccidental needle injury and transmission of infection.\n\n Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.\n\n Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.\n\n \n\nStep 1. Check the insulin \n\n \n\nA. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. Insuman SoloStar is \nwhite with a colour on the injection button. The injection button colour will vary based on the \n\nformulation of Insuman insulin used. The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only. \n\n \n\nB. Take off the pen cap. \n \n\nC. Check the appearance of your insulin. \nIf you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and \n\ndown at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin. Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the \n\ncartridge. \n\n\n\n461 \n \n\n \n \n\nAfter mixing check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin suspensions must have an evenly \n\nmilky-white appearance. \n\n \n\nStep 2. Attach the needle \n\n \n\nAlways use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential \n\nneedle blocks. \n\n \n\nBefore use of the needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles. \n\nPlease note: The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only. \n\nA. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. \n \n\nB. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending \non the needle type). \n\n \n\n. \n\n If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause \nleakage, or break the needle. \n\n \n\n \nStep 3. Perform a safety test \n\n \n\nAlways perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: \n\n ensuring that pen and needle work properly\n\n removing air bubbles\n \n\nA. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. \n\n \n\n \n\nB. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the \ninner needle cap and discard it. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n462 \n \n\n \n \n\nC. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. \n \n\nD. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. \n \n\nE. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. \n\n \n \n\nYou may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. \n\n \n\n If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to \nremove them.\n\n If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.\n\n If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use \nthis SoloStar.\n\n \n\nStep 4. Select the dose \n\n \n\nYou can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you \n\nneed a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. \n\n \n\nA. Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. \n \n\nB. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past \nyour dose, you can turn back down. \n\n \n\n \n\n Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.\n \n\n You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the \ndosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and \n\ncomplete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n463 \n \n\nStep 5. Inject the dose \n\n \n\nA. Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n\nB. Insert the needle into the skin. \n \n\n \n\nC. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window \nwill return to “0” as you inject. \n\n \n \n\nD. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the \nneedle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. \n\n \n\nThe pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the \n\ntotal of 300 units of insulin has been used. \n\n \n\nStep 6. Remove and discard the needle \n\n \n\nAlways remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. \n\nThis helps prevent: \n\n Contamination and/or infection\n\n Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.\n\n \n\nA. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To \nreduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. \n\n \n\n If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, \nspecial caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow \n\nrecommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your doctor, \n\npharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases.\n\n \n\nB. Dispose of the needle safely. \n \n\nC. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. \n \n\nStorage instructions \n\n \n\nPlease check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar. \n\n \n\nIf your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to \n\nroom temperature. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. \n\n \n\nDiscard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n464 \n \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\nProtect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. \n\n \n\nYou can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. \n\nDo not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. \n\nYour SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid \n\nsituations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, \n\nuse a new one. \n\n\n\n465 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a vial \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet.

What Insuman Infusat is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Infusat contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action. \n\nInsuman Infusat must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Infusat \n\nDo not use Insuman Infusat \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Infusat. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Infusat). Contact your doctor if \n\n\n\n466 \n \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic  \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Infusat \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n\n\n\n467 \n \n\n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Infusat in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \n\nInsuman Infusat contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Infusat \n\nDose \n\n\n\n468 \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \n\nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Infusat per day you will need, how much of this is infused \ncontinuously (\"basal rate\") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an \"insulin \n\nboost\" (\"bolus dose\"), \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insuman Infusat, \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how \n\noften you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the \n\ninsulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. \n\n \n\nDo not use Insuman Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in which you must not \n\nstart or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for these pumps. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat has been developed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron. It must only be used in \n\ninsulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used \n\nfor infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump will tell you how to use it. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, \n\nand has a water-like consistency. \n\n \n\nThe insulin cartridge of the pump must be sterile and must be used once only. After filling the cartridge \n\nof the pump keep it at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before using it, so that you can see and \n\nremove any air bubbles which form during warming-up. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before injection \n\n \n\nBefore starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other \n\ndisinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Infusat must NOT be mixed with any other \n\ninsulin preparations. \n\n \n\nInsulin pump faults \n\n \n\nYou should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired \n\nblood sugar levels, \n\n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at larger doses or more often than usual, or \n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at smaller doses or less often than usual. \n\n \n\nFor details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual. \n\n \n\nIf the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection \n\nsyringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use only those \n\ninjection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per \n\n\n\n469 \n \n\nml. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Infusat than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Infusat, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Infusat \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Infusat or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Infusat \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Infusat without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nInfusat and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\n\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\n\n\n470 \n \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Infusat \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial \n\nafter “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Infusat next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nOpened vials \n\nOnce in-use, the vial may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks in the outer carton not above 25°C and \n\naway from direct heat (for example next to a heating unit) or direct light (direct sunlight or next to a \n\nlamp). Do not use the vial after this time period. It is recommended that the date of the first use be \n\nnoted on the label. \n\n \n\nOnce in the pump, Insuman Infusat may be kept for up to 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Infusat\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n\n\n474 \n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Infusat\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that \nyou are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes \n\nor a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial \n\nsweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n475 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat 100 IU/ml solution for injection in a cartridge \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because in contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n1. What Insuman Infusat is and what it is used for \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Infusat is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Infusat contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology process \n\nand is identical with the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action. It comes in \n\ncartridges designed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron (insulin pumps). \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat must only be used in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus who need \n\ntreatment with insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin \n\nto control the level of blood sugar. \n\n \n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Infusat \n\nDo not use Insuman Infusat \n\nIf you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\n \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Insuman Infusat. \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity \n\n(physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \nlower dose. \n\n\n\n476 \n \n\nSkin changes at the injection site \n\nThe injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may \n\nnot work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insuman Infusat). Contact your doctor if \n\nyou are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may \n\ntell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic  \n\nmedications dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about \n\n- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, \n- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc., \n- correct storage of your insulin while travelling, \n- whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible effects of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. \n\n \n\nIf you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue \n\nto get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require \n\ninsulin. \n\n \n\nSome patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who \n\nwere treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your \n\ndoctor as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath \n\nor rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Infusat \n\n \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that \n\nare either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what \n\naction, if any, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n\n\n\n477 \n \n\n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n\n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to \ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat with alcohol \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\n \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\nHowever, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Infusat in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\n \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n \n\nKeep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk \n\n(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n \n\nInsuman Infusat contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n\n\n\n478 \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Infusat \n\nDose \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\npharmacist if you are not sure. \n\n \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Infusat per day you will need, how much of this is infused \ncontinuously (\"basal rate\") and how much and when you need additional insulin as an \"insulin \n\nboost\" (\"bolus dose\"), \n\n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, \n- tell you when you may need to use a higher or lower dose of Insuman Infusat. \n\n \n\nMany factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are able \n\nto react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too \n\nlow. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat is a solution to be given under the skin. \n\n \n\nYour doctor will show you how and in which area of the skin you should infuse your insulin and how \n\noften you must change the puncture site within the particular area of skin where you are infusing the \n\ninsulin. Speak to your doctor before you change the area of skin that you are infusing. \n\n \n\nDo not use Insuman Infusat in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing. Situations in which you must not \n\nstart or continue to use insulin pumps are described in the operating manuals for these pumps. \n\n \n\nHow to handle the cartridges \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat comes in cartridges designed for use in Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron. It must only be \n\nused in insulin pumps suitable for this insulin. Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must \n\nbe used for infusion. The operating manual provided with the pump will tell you how to use it. \n\n \n\nInsuman Infusat must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, \n\nand has a water-like consistency. \n\n \n\nKeep the cartridge at room temperature 1 to 2 hours before inserting it in the pump so that you can see \n\nand remove any air bubbles which form during warming-up. \n\n \n\nSpecial care before infusion \n\n \n\nBefore starting the infusion remove any air bubbles. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other \n\ndisinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. \n\n \n\nDo not mix insulin with any other medicines. Insuman Infusat must NOT be mixed with any other \n\ninsulin preparations. \n\n \n\nDo not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. \n\n \n\nInsulin pump faults \n\n \n\nYou should always consider the possibility of a technical problem if, in order to achieve the desired \n\nblood sugar levels, \n\n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at larger doses or more often than usual, or \n- you need additional insulin (\"bolus doses\") at smaller doses or less often than usual. \n\n\n\n479 \n \n\n \n\nFor details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps see the operating manual. \n\n \n\nIf the pump does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection \n\nsyringe. Therefore, keep injection syringes and injection needles as well. However, use only those \n\ninjection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per \n\nml. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Infusat than you should \n\n- If you have injected too much Insuman Infusat, your blood sugar level may become too low \n(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you \n\nmust eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of \n\nhypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Infusat \n\n- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Infusat or if you have not injected enough insulin, \nyour blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar \n\nfrequently. For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this \n\nleaflet. \n\n- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Infusat \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Infusat without \n\nspeaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsulin Mix-ups \n\n \n\nYou must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Insuman \n\nInfusat and other insulins. \n\n \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions \nto insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n Oedema\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n Injection site reactions\n\n\n\n480 \n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly \n\n Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n Sodium retention\n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe \n\nhypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Skin changes at the injection site \nIf you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may \n\neither shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin may also be caused \n\nby build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may not work very \n\nwell if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent \n\nthese skin changes. \n\n Skin and allergic reactions\nOther mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on \n\ninjection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur. They can also \n\nspread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few \n\nweeks. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against \n\ninsulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. \n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \n\nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \n\nsafety of this medicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Infusat \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the \n\ncartridge after “EXP”. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened cartridges \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Do not put Insuman Infusat next to the freezer \n\ncompartment or a freezer pack. Keep the cartridge in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n\n \n\nOnce in the pump, Insuman Infusat may be kept for up to 2 weeks. \n\n \n\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \n\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n\n \n\n6.

Stomach pain, fast and deep \n\nbreathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) \n\nresulting from lack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms \n\noccur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a \n\nhospital. \n\n \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may \n\ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to \n\nrecognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you inject too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and \n\nsubstances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT \n\ncarbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines \n\nand Insuman Infusat\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper \n\narm), \n\n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: \n\nsweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular \n\nheartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n\n\n484 \n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and \n\ntingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after \n\nyourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker \n\nor may be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \n\nInsuman Infusat\"). \n\n \n\nIn such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not \n\nconfident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which \n\nyou or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Stop your insulin infusion (if necessary, by withdrawing the needle) at least until you feel that \nyou are fully alert again. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes \n\nor a sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial \n\nsweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or \npasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not \n\ncertain that you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia. \n \n\n\n\n485 \n \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable 400 IU/ml, solution for infusion \n\nInsulin human \n\n \n\nThe package leaflet is available in your national language on the European Medicines Agency web \n\nsite: http://www.ema.europa.eu/.

Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n \n\n1. What Insuman Implantable is and what it is used for \n \n\nInsuman Implantable contains the active substance insulin human which is made by a biotechnology \n\nprocess and is identical to the body's own insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable is an insulin solution with a rapid onset and short duration of action. When used \n\nwith an implantable insulin pump, Insuman Implantable will be continuously infused in your body and \n\nthus, may replace a long-acting insulin. \n\nInsuman Implantable (400 IU/ml) contains 4 times as much insulin in 1 ml as standard insulin \n\n(100 IU/ml). This means that Insuman Implantable is more concentrated than standard insulin. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable is used to reduce high blood sugar in adult patients with a certain form of \n\ndiabetes (type 1 diabetes mellitus). These patients are not adequately controlled despite intensive \n\ninjection of insulin under their skin (multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy). \n\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of \n\nblood sugar. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable must only be used in the Medtronic MiniMed pump which is implanted under the \n\nskin of your belly and infuses your insulin continuously. \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before you use Insuman Implantable \n\nDo not use Insuman Implantable \n\n- if you are allergic to insulin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n6). \n\n- via other routes of administration (e.g. injection). \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n486 \n \n\nDo not use the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump \n\n- if you are allergic to titanium alloy, polysulfone or silicone materials used in the implanted \ncomponents of the pump. \n\n- with other insulin medicine other than Insuman Implantable. \n- in adolescents who have not reached adult size. \n- if you live permanently at heights above 2439 meters (8000 feet). \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nIf you are ill or have mental problems that make you unable to make changes to your pump based on \n\nyour blood glucose level or to take the appropriate actions if you have a problem with your pump, talk \n\nto your doctor. \n\n \n\nBefore you can use the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump, you will be trained. This training will \n\nbe about this implantable insulin pump, how to use the pump and how to deal with special situations, \n\nsuch as hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. In addition, you should read and follow the instructions \n\ngiven in the patient manual accompanying the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. \n\nDo not use Insuman Implantable with any other syringes or pumps (external or implantable) than the \n\nimplantable pump supplied by Medtronic MiniMed. \n\n \n\nFollow closely the instructions for dose, monitoring (blood and/or urine tests), diet and physical \n\nactivity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. \n\n \n\nIf you expect to have frequent medical imaging (e.g. MRI or ultrasound), talk to your doctor. \n\nIf you are allergic to this medicine or to animal insulins, talk to your doctor. \n\nHypoglycaemia \n\nLow blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may occur if you administer too much insulin. \n\nIf you experience severe low blood sugar levels, this may indicate a problem with your pump. If this \n\nhappens, immediately contact your doctor who is trained to perform pump investigations. \n\nYou must closely monitor your blood sugar level on refill days. During a refill procedure, a very small \n\namount of Insuman Implantable may be deposited subcutaneously, which might result in low blood \n\nsugar levels. \n\n \n\nHyperglycaemia \n\nIt is possible that the insulin can cause blockage of the implantable pump. You must check your blood \n\nsugar level at least four times daily to detect and prevent high blood sugar levels due to the pump not \n\nworking properly. If you get severe hyperglycemia (very high blood sugar) or ketoacidosis (build up \n\nof acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) or coma, this may indicate \n\na problem with the pump. If you notice a rapid increase in blood sugar level which does not respond to \n\na bolus dose of insulin, contact your doctor immediately. She/he is trained to perform pump \n\ninvestigations. In case the pump does not work properly you must always have access to injection \n\ndevices (e.g. syringe or pen) and insulin suitable for subcutaneous injection. To prevent such pump \n\nproblems, your doctor will schedule appointments at least every 6-months to rinse your pump. \n\n \n\nIn case your pump is damaged or your Personal Pump Communicator (PPC) is damaged or lost, review \n\nwith your doctor what you should do in case your pump does not work correctly. \n\n \n\nSite of the pump implantation \n\nInfection of the pump pocket (where your pump is placed), erosion of the skin where your pump is \n\nimplanted and poor healing of the incision site in your skin can occur. If you notice pain, redness, \n\nswelling in the area of your pump, contact your doctor. \n\n \n\nLiver reaction \n\nInsulin administration via the pump can cause a fat infiltration of the liver at single, well-defined \n\nlocations (called focal hepatic steatosis). This happens when the tip of your catheter is fixed or in very \n\n\n\n487 \n \n\nclose proximity to your liver. This seems to be reversible when your catheter is repositioned or your \n\ninsulin infusion stopped and without consequences on your health (see section 4). \n\n \n\nAntibodies to insulin \n\nInsulin treatment by continuous infusion in the body is likely to cause your body to produce antibodies \n\nto insulin (substances that act against insulin). This may require a change to your insulin dose (see \n\nsection 4). \n\n \n\nSpecial patient groups \n\nIf you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a \n\nlower dose. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nTalk to your doctor to find out what you should do if you plan: \n\n- to live at a height above 2439 meters (8000 feet) \n- to travel to a height above 2439 meters (8000 feet) other than commercial aircraft \n- to dive below 7.6 meters (25 feet). \n\n \n\nBefore travelling, consult your doctor. You may need to talk about: \n\n- the availability of your insulin and the hospital which will be able to replace the Insuman \nImplantable in the country you are visiting, \n\n- whom to contact in the event of technical problems with your pump, \n- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, \n- the possible problems of changing to different time zones, \n- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, \n- what you should do in emergency situations if you feel unwell or become ill. \n\n \n\nIllnesses and injuries \n\nIn the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require extra care (e.g. urine and \n\nblood tests): \n\n- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). \n- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). \nIn most cases you will need to see a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor quickly. \n\n \n\nBecause you have type 1 diabetes, an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, do not stop your insulin. If \n\nyou stop using your insulin this could lead to a very high blood sugar level. \n\nYou must also make sure you get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or \n\ntreating you that you require insulin. \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThere is no experience with Insuman Implantable in children and adolescents below 18 years. Due to \n\nthe size of the pump, adolescents who have not reached the adult size must not be implanted. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Insuman Implantable \n\nSome medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the \n\nsituation). You may need to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low \n\nor too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. \n\n \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n\nBefore taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if \n\nany, you need to take. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: \n\n- all other medicines to treat diabetes, \n- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high \n\nblood pressure), \n\n- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), \n\n\n\n488 \n \n\n- fluoxetine (used to treat depression), \n- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), \n- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), \n- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever), \n- sulfonamide antibiotics. \n\n \n\nMedicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: \n\n- corticosteroids (such as \"cortisone\" used to treat inflammation), \n- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), \n- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), \n- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), \n- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), \n- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), \n- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), \n- somatropin (growth hormone), \n- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to \n\ntreat asthma), \n\n- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), \n- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV), \n- atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as olanzapine and clozapine). These medicines are used \n\nfor mental problems that affect how you think, feel or act. \n\n \n\nYour blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: \n\n- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), \n- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). \n\n \n\nPentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may \n\nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \n\n \n\nBeta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may \n\nweaken or stop the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIf you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n \n\nInsuman Implantable with alcohol \n\nYour blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. \n\n \n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour doctor for advice before taking this medicine. There is no clinical information with the use of \n\nInsuman Implantable in an implantable pump in pregnant women. \n\n \n\nInform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your \n\ninsulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful \n\ncontrol of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. \n\n \n\nIf you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and \n\nyour diet. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \n\nYour ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: \n\n- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), \n- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), \n- you have problems with your sight. \n\n\n\n489 \n \n\nKeep this in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a \n\ncar or using machines). \n\n \n\nYou should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: \n\n- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, \n- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. \n\n \n\nImportant information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Implantable \n\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n\n \n \n\n3. How to use Insuman Implantable \n \n\nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor or \n\nnurse if you are not sure. \n\nInsuman Implantable will be prescribed by a doctor who has received training in the use of the \n\nMedtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump. \n\n \n\nDose \n\nBased on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will \n\n- determine how much Insuman Implantable per day you will need, \n- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests. \n\n \n\nMany things may affect your blood sugar level. You should know what these are so that you can react \n\ncorrectly to changes in your blood sugar level and prevent it from becoming too high or too low. See \n\nthe box at the end of this leaflet for further information. \n\n \n\nThe insulin in your pump must be replaced every 40 to 45 days with new insulin. Do not extend this \n\nperiod of time. Contact your doctor immediately if you are unable to go to the hospital or clinicto \n\nreplace the insulin in your pump. Based on your needs, you may need to replace your insulin earlier. \n\n \n\nThe pump is not connected to a glucose meter. You should practice good diabetes care and test your \n\nown blood sugar levels at least four times daily to check your blood sugar levels and determine insulin \n\ndoses. \n\n \n\nPart of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously by the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump \n\nand the remaining part of the daily dose is administered by you, using the same pump, as a bolus \n\nbefore meals. The amount of insulin is constantly monitored through the PPC which communicates \n\nwith the pump via radio waves. \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nInsuman Implantable must only be used in the Medtronic MiniMed implantable pump. \n\nInsuman Implantable must not be used with any other type of injection devices (e.g. syringes). \n\n \n\nThe Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump, which is implanted under the skin of your belly, infuses \n\nyour insulin continuously (continuous intraperitoneal infusion). You will be admitted to the hospital to \n\nhave the Medtronic MiniMed Implantable Pump surgically implanted in your belly. The pump system \n\nwill also be programmed and tested prior to your leaving the hospital. \n\n \n\nAll pump procedures (such as pump refill, rinsing of the pump, pump investigations to check whether \n\nyour pump works properly) are performed using sterile technique to avoid risk of infection. Infections \n\naround the pump implantation site may require the removal of your pump (explantation of the pump). \n\n \n\nPump refill \n\nHow to handle the vials \n\nYour doctor will be handling the insulin vials and has the accessories (e.g. refill syringes and needles) \n\nand equipment required to fill your implantable pump. \n\n\n\n490 \n \n\nRefilling the pump is a sterile procedure which must be carried out in the hospital or clinic. The \n\nunused insulin in the pump will be removed and the pump refilled with fresh insulin. \n\nThe insulin in your pump must be replaced every 40 to 45 days with new insulin or earlier based on \n\nyour insulin needs. Alarms in your PPC will let you know if your reservoir level is getting low. Do not \n\nextend this period of time (45 days) and contact your doctor immediately if you are unable to go to the \n\nhospital or clinic to replace the insulin in your pump. \n\nYou must closely monitor your blood sugar level on refill days. During this procedure, a very small \n\namount of Insuman Implantable may be deposited under your skin, which may result in low blood \n\nsugar levels. \n\n \n\nPump blockage \n\nInsulin deposits can cause blockage of the pump. If you need to increase your insulin to maintain your \n\nblood sugar level, if you experience refractory hyperglycaemia, this may indicate a problem with the \n\npump. You must contact your doctor immediately. She/he is trained to perform pump procedures \n\nwhich are needed tomake sure your pump works properly. To prevent pump problems, your doctor \n\nwill schedule appointments at least every 6-months to rinse your pump. \n\n \n\nIf you use more Insuman Implantable than you should \n\nYour doctor will program maximum dose limits into your PPC. \n\nIf you try to deliver more than 2.5 times the bolus maximum in one hour, the alarm “hourly max \n\nexceeded” will be displayed on your PPC screen. If you need to deliver one additional bolus, press \n\n“SEL” and then “ACT”. You may exceed this limit by programming only one bolus within \n\n10 minutes. If you try to deliver a second bolus, you will receive the hourly max exceeded alarm on \n\nyour PPC screen again. \n\n \n\nIf you forget to use Insuman Implantable \n\n If you forget the dose before a meal:\nYou may feel symptoms of high blood sugar after you eat. If this occurs, you should contact your \n\ndoctor immediately. Your doctor will tell you how to manage your blood glucose levels. \n\n \n\n If you forget to have your pump refilled:\nThe insulin in your pump must be replaced every 40 to 45 days with new insulin. Do not extend this \n\nperiod of time (45 days) and contact your doctor immediately if you are unable to go to the hospital or \n\nclinic to replace the insulin in your pump. \n\nBased on your needs, you may need to replace your insulin earlier. The PPC prompts you with \n\nmessages on the screen. If your pump has run out of insulin or is delivering less insulin than you need, \n\nyou may feel symptoms of high blood sugar. If this happens, contact your doctor immediately. Your \n\ndoctor will tell you how to manage your blood glucose levels. \n\n \n\nIf you stop using Insuman Implantable \n\nThis could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in \n\nthe blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Insuman Implantable \n\nwithout speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. \n\n \n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. \n\n\n\n491 \n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\n \n\n► Side effects reported with the insulin \n \n\nMost serious side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n The most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Serious hypoglycaemia may \ncause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. For further information on the side \n\neffects of low blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n Hyperglycaemia: If your blood sugar is too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. \nHyperglycaemia can become serious and lead to a serious condition (ketoacidosis). For further \n\ninformation on side effects of high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.\n\n \n\nSide effects reported uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) \n\n Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock)\n\n \n\nSide effects reported with a frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) \n\n Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening. Such reactions to \ninsulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), \n\nsevere swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood \n\npressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.\n\n \n\nOther side effects \n\nSide effects reported commonly \n\n Oedema\n\nInsulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and \n\nankles. \n\n \nSide effects reported with a frequency not known \n\n Sodium retention\n\nInsulin may also cause sodium retention, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by \n\nintensified insulin therapy \n\n Eye reactions\nA marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision \n\ntemporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic \n\nattacks may cause temporary loss of vision. \n\n Insulin antibodies\nInsulin administration via the intraperitoneal route can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin \n\n(substances that act against insulin). Elevated levels of antibodies to insulin are not commonly \n\nassociated with a need to change your insulin dose or occurrence of serious side effects. \n\n Liver reaction\n\nInsulin administration via the pump can cause a fat infiltration of the liver at single, well-defined locations \n\n(called focal hepatic steatosis). This happens when the tip of your catheter is fixed or in very close \n\nproximity to your liver. \n\n \n\n► Side effects reported with the implantable pump (including side effects related to implantation \nof the pump and or pump maintenance) \n\nSide effects reported commonly \n\n Change of the pump due to malfunction\n\n Pump blockage\n\n Catheter occlusion\n\n Infection of space where the pump has been implanted (pump pocket)\n\n Skin erosion: the movements of the pump can erode your skin\n\n Outward bulge in the navel area (Umbilical hernia)\n\n\n\n492 \n \n\n Stomach ache\n\n Pain due to the catheter positioning\n\n \n\nReporting of side effects \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not \n\nlisted in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \n\nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this \n\nmedicine. \n\n \n \n\n5. How to store Insuman Implantable \n \n\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n\n \n\nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the label of the vial after \n\n‘EXP’. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. \n\n \n\nUnopened vials \n\nStore in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze.

Stomach ache, fast and deep breathing, \n\nsleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from \n\nlack of insulin. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia \n\n \n\nTest your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur. \n\nSevere hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital. \n\n \n \n\nHYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) \n\n \n\nIf your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a \n\nheart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to recognise when \n\nyour blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. \n\n \n\nWhy does hypoglycaemia occur? \n\n \n\nExamples include: \n\n- you administer too much insulin, \n- you miss meals or delay them, \n- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances \n\nsimilar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates), \n\n- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, \n- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, \n- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, \n- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, \n- you are recovering from an illness or from fever, \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/\n\n\n495 \n \n\n- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and \nInsuman Implantable\"). \n\n \n\nHypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if: \n\n- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, \n- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, \n- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. \n\n \n\nWarning symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n- In your body \nExamples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, \n\nclammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat. These \n\nsymptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. \n\n \n\n- In your brain \nExamples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, \n\nvomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in \n\nconcentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of \n\nspeech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling \n\nsensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, \n\nconvulsions, loss of consciousness. \n\n \n\nThe first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (\"warning symptoms\") may change, be weaker or \n\nmay be missing altogether if \n\n- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of \nnervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), \n\n- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, \n- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, \n- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman, \n- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, \"Other medicines and Insuman \n\nImplantable\"). \n\n \n\nIf this happens, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the \n\nproblem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can \n\nhelp to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not confident \n\nabout recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others \n\nwould be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nWhat should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia \n\n \n\n1. Do not administer insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a \nsugar-sweetened beverage. Beware: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such \n\nas diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. \n\n2. Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta). \nYour doctor or nurse should have talked to you about this before. \n\n3. If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. \n4. Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if itcomes back. \n\n \n\nTell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: \n\n \n\nIf you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or \n\nglucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not certain \n\nthat you have hypoglycaemia. \n\n \n\nIt is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have \n\nhypoglycaemia.","content_length":1126131,"file_size":2223205}],"conditional_approval":false,"exceptional_circumstances":false,"indication":"<div> \n <div class=\"ecl-field__body\"> \n  <div class=\"ecl-editor first last\">\n   <p>Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required.
