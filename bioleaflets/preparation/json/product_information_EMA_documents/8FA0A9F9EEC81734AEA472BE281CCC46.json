This will allow quick identification of \n\nnew safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. \n\nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \n\nLutathera 370 MBq/mL solution for infusion \n\n \n\n \n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne mL of solution contains 370 MBq of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide at the date and time of \n\ncalibration. \n\n \n\nThe total amount of radioactivity per single dose vial is 7,400 MBq at the date and time of infusion. \n\nGiven the fixed volumetric activity of 370 MBq/mL at the date and time of calibration, the volume of \n\nthe solution is adjusted between 20.5 mL and 25.0 mL in order to provide the required amount of \n\nradioactivity at the date and time of infusion. \n\n \n\nLutetium (177Lu) has a half-life of 6.647 days. Lutetium (177Lu) decays by β- emission to stable \n\nHafnium (177Hf) with the most abundant β- (79.3%) having a maximum energy of 0.497 MeV. The \n\naverage beta energy is approximately 0.13 MeV. Low gamma energy is also emitted, for instance at \n\n113 keV (6.2%) and 208 keV (11%). \n\n \n\nExcipient with known effect \n\nEach mL of solution contains 0.14 mmol (3.2 mg) of sodium. \n\n \n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \n\nSolution for infusion. \n\nClear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \n\nLutathera is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated \n\n(G1 and G2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours \n\n(GEP-NETs) in adults. \n\n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n\n \n\nLutathera should be administered only by persons authorised to handle radiopharmaceuticals in \n\ndesignated clinical settings (see section 6.6) and after evaluation of the patient by a qualified \n\nphysician. \n\n \n\nBefore starting treatment with Lutathera, somatostatin receptor imaging (scintigraphy or positron \n\nemission tomography [PET]) must confirm the overexpression of these receptors in the tumour tissue \n\nwith the tumour uptake at least as high as normal liver uptake. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\nPosology \n\nAdults \n\nThe recommended treatment regimen of Lutathera in adults consists of 4 infusions of 7,400 MBq \n\neach. The recommended interval between each administration is 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nInformation on dose modifications to manage severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions is given in \n\nthe respective section below. \n\n \n\nFor renal protection purpose, an amino acid solution must be administered intravenously during \n\n4 hours. The infusion of the amino acid solution should start 30 minutes prior to start of Lutathera \n\ninfusion. \n\n \n\nAmino acid solution \n\nThe amino acid solution can be prepared as a compounded product, in compliance with the hospital’s \n\nsterile medicinal product preparation good practices and according to the composition specified in \n\nTable 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1. Composition of the compounded amino acid solution \n\n \n\nCompound Amount \n\nL-Lysine HCl  25 g* \n\nL-Arginine HCl 25 g** \n\nSodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, or \n\nwater for injections \n\n1 L \n\n*equivalent to 20.0 g lysine \n\n** equivalent to 20.7 g arginine \n\n \n\nAlternatively, some commercially available amino acid solutions can be used if compliant with the \n\nspecification described in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2. Specification of commercially available amino acid solutions \n\n \n\nCharacteristic Specification \n\nL-Lysine HCl content Between 18 and 25 g* \n\nL-Arginine HCl content Between 18 and 25 g** \n\nVolume 1 L to 2 L \n\nOsmolality < 1,200 mOsmol/kg \n\n*equivalent to 14.4-20 g lysine \n\n**equivalent to 14.9-20.7 g arginine \n\n \n\nAn amino acid solution containing just lysine and arginine in the amounts specified in Table 1 is \n\nconsidered the medicinal product of choice, due to its lower total volume to be infused and lower \n\nosmolality. \n\n \n\nTreatment monitoring \n\nBefore each administration and during the treatment, biological tests are required to re-assess the \n\npatient’s condition and adapt the therapeutic protocol if necessary (dose, infusion interval, number of \n\ninfusions). \n\nThe minimum laboratory tests needed before each infusion are: \n\n Haematology (Haemoglobin [Hb], white blood cell count, platelet count) \n\n Kidney function (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance) \n\n Liver function (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT], aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT], albumin, \n\nbilirubin) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\nThese tests should be performed at least once within 2 to 4 weeks prior to administration, and shortly \n\nbefore the administration. It is also recommended to perform these tests every 4 weeks for at least \n\n3 months after the last infusion of Lutathera and every 6 months thereafter, in order to be able to detect \n\npossible delayed adverse reactions (see section 4.8). Dosing may need to be modified based on the test \n\nresults. \n\n \n\nDose modification \n\nManagement of severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions may require temporary dose interruption, \n\nextending dosing interval from 8 weeks up to 16 weeks, dose reduction, or discontinuation of \n\ntreatment with Lutathera (see Table 3 and Figure 1). \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Scheme of instructions for dose modifications \n\n \n\n \nDMT: Dose modifying toxicity \n\n \n\nOther reasons to consider temporary dose interruption of Lutathera include occurrence of an \n\nintercurrent disease (e.g. urinary tract infection), which according to the physician could increase the \n\nrisks associated to Lutathera administration, and which should be resolved or stabilized for treatment \n\nto resume; and major surgery, in which case treatment should be withheld for 12 weeks after the date \n\nof surgery. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\nSpecial populations \n\nElderly \n\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients 65 years or above as clinical experience has not identified \n\ndifferences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, since increased risk of \n\npresenting haematotoxicity has been described in elderly patients (≥ 70 years old), a close follow up \n\nallowing for prompt dose adaptation (DMT) in this population is advisable. \n\n \n\nRenal impairment \n\nCareful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation \n\nexposure is possible in these patients. The pharmacokinetic profile and safety of lutetium (177Lu) \n\noxodotreotide in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease has not been studied. \n\nTreatment with Lutathera in patients with severe kidney failure with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min \n\nis contraindicated (see section 4.3). Treatment with Lutathera in patients with creatinine clearance \n\n< 40 mL/min at baseline (using Cockcroft Gault) is not recommended. No dose adjustment is \n\nrecommended for renally impaired patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min. However, as this \n\nmedicinal product is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, renal function should be more \n\nfrequently monitored during the treatment as these patients may be at a greater risk of toxicity. \n\nFor additional details about the treatment of patient with renal impairment see Table 3 in section 4.2 \n\nand section 4.4. \n\n \n\nHepatic impairment \n\nNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Careful \n\nconsideration of the activity to be administered to patients with hepatic impairment is required since \n\nan increased radiation exposure is possible in these patients. The pharmacokinetic profile of lutetium \n\n(177Lu) oxodotreotide in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied (total bilirubin \n\n> 3 times upper limit of normal and any ASAT), therefore those patients should only be treated with \n\nLutathera after careful benefit-risk assessment. \n\nFor additional details about the treatment of patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, see \n\nTable 3 and section 4.4. \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThere is no relevant use of Lutathera in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of \n\nGEP-NETs (excluding neuroblastoma, neuroganglioblastoma, phaeochromocytoma). \n\n \n\nMethod of administration \n\nLutathera is for intravenous use. It is a ready to use radiopharmaceutical medicinal product for single \n\nuse only. \n\n \n\nLutathera must be administered by slow intravenous infusion over approximately 30 minutes, \n\nconcomitantly with amino acid solution administered by contralateral intravenous infusion. This \n\nmedicinal product must not be injected as a bolus. \n\nPremedication with antiemetics should be injected at least 30 minutes prior to the start of amino acid \n\nsolution infusion to reach the full antiemetic efficacy of the selected product, according to the \n\nrespective product information. \n \n\nThe recommended infusion method for administration of Lutathera is the gravity method, described in \n\nmore detail in this section. Treating physicians may use other methods deemed appropriate and safe, \n\nincluding the use of infusion pumps, particularly when dose reduction is required. During the \n\nadministration the recommended radiation safety precaution measures should be undertaken regardless \n\nof the infusion method (see section 6.6). \n\n \n\nLutathera should be infused directly from its original container. The vial must not be opened or the \n\nsolution transferred to another container. During the administration only disposable materials should \n\nbe used. \n\nThe medicinal product should be infused through an intravenous catheter placed in the vein \n\nexclusively for its infusion. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\nRequirements \n\nStorage of the vial \n\n Either in a container made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), a transparent radioprotection \n\ncontainer that allows a direct visual inspection of the vial, \n\n Or in the lead container in which Lutathera is delivered. \n\n \n\nRoom and equipment preparation: \n\n Administration room: \n\n The floor and the furniture should be covered with tissue paper to avoid any accidental \n\ncontamination \n\n \n\n Medicinal products to be administered: \n\n One vial of Lutathera \n\n One bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (500 mL) \n\n Amino acid solution bag(s) \n\n Antiemetics \n\n \n\n Care supplies and equipment: \n\n Two infusion poles \n\n One Long needle (recommended 90 – 100 mm, 18 gauge) \n\n One Short needle (recommended 25 mm, 20 gauge) \n\n Two gravity intravenous infusion sets with a clamp to regulate or stop the flow (one for \n\nLutathera, one for amino acid solution administration) \n\n Two peripheral intravenous plastic catheters \n\n One sterile tubing line with a clamp to regulate or stop the flow \n\n A pair of tongs (for Lutathera vial handling) \n\n Calibrated radioactivity measurement system and Geiger counter to monitor the \n\nradioactivity of Lutathera \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nLutathera vial tubing connections procedure (see Figure 2): \n\n The tubing line should be pre-filled with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection \n\nand then connected with a venous catheter previously inserted to the patient’s arm. \n\n The infusion set should be connected to the bag of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution \n\nfor injection and pre-filled by opening the clamp. \n\n The short needle should be inserted into the Lutathera vial, so that it does not touch the \n\nradiopharmaceutical solution. This will equilibrate pressure thus reducing any risk of leakage. \n\n The short needle should be then connected to the pre-filled infusion set. \n\n The long needle should be connected to the pre-filled tubing line and then inserted into the \n\nLutathera vial, so that it touches the bottom of the vial. This will allow for the complete \n\nextraction of the radiopharmaceutical solution. \n\n The flow of the radiopharmaceutical solution should be regulated with the clamps. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Gravity infusion method - tubing connection scheme \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\nAdministration procedure (gravity method) \n\nDuring the infusion, the flow of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection increases the \n\npressure in the Lutathera vial, facilitating the flow of Lutathera into the catheter inserted in the \n\npatient’s peripheral vein. \n\nCareful monitoring of the vital signs during the infusion is recommended. \n\n \n\n1. Two intravenous plastic catheters should be inserted into patient’s peripheral veins, one on each \n\narm. \n\n2. The catheters should be connected to the infusion sets (one for Lutathera, one for amino acid \n\nsolution). \n\n3. Antiemetic premedication should be administered at least 30 minutes prior to the start of amino \n\nacid solution infusion (see section 4.2). \n\n4. Administration of the amino acid solution should be initiated 30 minutes before Lutathera \n\ninfusion, with an infusion rate of 250 to 500 mL/h (depending on volume). Amino acid solution \n\nshould be administered over 4 hour time span. In case of severe nausea or vomiting during \n\namino acid solution infusion, an antiemetic of a different pharmacological class can be \n\nadministered. \n\n5. Radioactivity in the Lutathera vial should be measured immediately before infusion using a \n\ncalibrated radioactivity measurement system. \n\n6. Lutathera infusion should start 30 minutes after the beginning of the amino acid solution \n\ninfusion, with the infusion rate of approximately 400 mL/h (this infusion rate is the reference \n\nrate; the infusion should start at a lower rate of < 100mL/h for the first 5 to 10 minutes and \n\nshould then be increased depending on the patient’s venous status). Lutathera should be \n\nadministered over 30 ± 10 minute time span. Constant intra-vial pressure should be maintained \n\nduring the entire infusion. \n\n7. Lutathera administration should be initiated by opening first the tubing line connected to the \n\npatient’s peripheral vein, and then, by opening the infusion set connected to the bag of sodium \n\nchloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. The pole height should be adjusted in order to \n\ncompensate any increase or reduction of pressure inside the vial. Moving the patient’s arm \n\nposition should be avoided if possible (extreme flexion or extension which could lead to vein \n\ncompression). \n\n8. The flow of Lutathera from the vial to the patient should be monitored during the entire \n\ninfusion. Soon after the start of the infusion, the radioactivity emission over the patient’s thorax \n\nshould be measured using Geiger counter to verify the presence of Lutathera in the bloodstream. \n\nSubsequent checks of the radioactivity emission should be performed approximately every \n\n5 minutes at the level of the patient’s thorax and vial. During the infusion, the radioactivity \n\nemission from the patient’s thorax should steadily increase while the one from the Lutathera \n\nvial should decrease. \n\n9. To ensure complete administration, the Lutathera vial should be kept under even pressure. The \n\nlevel of solution in the vial should remain constant during the entire infusion. \n\nVisual controls of the solution levels should be repeated during the administration by direct \n\nvisual control (when PMMA container is used) or using a pair of tongs to handle the vial when \n\nthe lead shipping container is used. \n\n10. The infusion should be stopped once the radioactivity emission from the vial becomes stable for \n\nseveral minutes (or during two consecutive measurements). This is the only parameter to \n\ndetermine the procedure completion. The volume of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution \n\nfor injection necessary to complete the infusion may vary. \n\n11. Total activity administered is equal to the activity in the vial before infusion minus the activity \n\nremaining in the vial after the infusion. The measurements should be performed using a \n\ncalibrated system. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nThe following table summarises the required procedures during a treatment course with Lutathera \n\nusing the gravity method: \n\n \n\nTable 4.

The activity \n\nadministered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required \n\ntherapeutic effect. \n\nGiven the mechanism of action and the tolerance profile of Lutathera, it is not recommended to start \n\ntreatment with Lutathera in patients with somatostatin receptor negative or mixed visceral lesions \n\naccording to somatostatin receptor imaging. \n\n \n\nMyelosuppression \n\nBecause of the potential for undesirable effects, blood counts must be monitored at baseline and \n\nduring treatment and until resolution of any eventual toxicity (see section 4.2). Patients with impaired \n\nhaematological function and patients who have received prior chemotherapy or external beam \n\nradiotherapy (involving more than 25% of the bone marrow) may be at higher risk of haematological \n\ntoxicity during Lutathera treatment. Treatment initiation is not recommended in patients with severely \n\nimpaired haematological function at baseline (e.g. Hb < 4.9 mmol/L or 8 g/dL, platelets < 75 g/L or \n\n75 x 103/mm3, or leukocytes < 2 g/L or 2000/mm3) (except lymphopenia). \n\n \n\nMyelodisplastic syndrome and acute leukaemia \n\nLate-onset myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukaemia (AL) have been observed after \n\ntreatment with Lutathera (see section 4.8), occurring approximately 28 months (9 – 41) for MDS and \n\n55 months (32 - 125) for AL after the end of treatment. Etiology of this therapy related secondary \n\nmyeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) is unclear. Factors such as age > 70 years, impaired renal function, \n\nbaseline cytopenias, prior number of therapies, prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (specifically \n\nalkylating agents), and prior radiotherapy are suggested as potential risks and/or predictive factors for \n\nMDS/AL. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nRenal toxicity \n\nBecause lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is almost exclusively eliminated through the renal system, it is \n\nmandatory to concomitantly administer an amino acid solution containing the amino acids L-lysine \n\nand L-arginine. The amino acids solution will help to decrease reabsorption of lutetium (177Lu) \n\noxodotreotide through the proximal tubules, resulting in a significant reduction in the kidney radiation \n\ndose (see section 4.2). When the recommended concomitant amino acids infusion is delivered over a \n\n4 hour time span, a mean reduction in kidney radiation exposure of about 47% has been reported. \n\nIt is not recommended to decrease the amount of amino acid solution in case of Lutathera dose \n\nadaptation. \n\nPatients should be encouraged to empty their bladder as frequently as possible during the \n\nadministration of amino acids and the hours after administration. \n\nRenal function as determined by serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance must be assessed \n\nat baseline, during and at least for the first year after treatment (see section 4.2). \n\nPatients with renal impairment at baseline, or with renal or urinary tract morphological abnormalities \n\nmay be at greater risk of toxicity. Treatment with Lutathera in patients with creatinine clearance \n\n< 40 mL/min (using Cockcroft Gault) at baseline is not recommended. More frequent monitoring of \n\nrenal function is recommended in renally impaired patients with creatinine clearance > 40 mL/min \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\nFor patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, an increased risk for transient hyperkalemia due \n\nto the amino acid solution should also be taken into consideration (see Warning and precaution \n\nregarding the co-administered renal protective amino acid solution). \n\n \n\nHepatic toxicity \n\nSince many patients referred for Lutathera therapy have hepatic metastasis, it may be common to \n\nobserve patients with altered baseline liver function. Patients with hepatic metastasis or pre-existing \n\nadvanced hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hepatotoxicity due to radiation exposure. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended to monitor ALAT, ASAT, bilirubin and albumin serum during treatment \n\n(see section 4.2). \n\nPatients with baseline liver impairment with either total bilirubinemia > 3 times the upper limit of \n\nnormal or albuminemia < 30 g/L and prothrombin ratio decreased < 70%, should only be treated with \n\nLutathera after careful benefit-risk assessment (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nNausea and vomiting \n\nTo avoid treatment-related nausea and vomiting, an intravenous bolus of an antiemetic medicinal \n\nproduct should be injected at least 30 minutes prior to the start of amino acid solution infusion to reach \n\nthe full antiemetic efficacy (see section 4.2). \n\n \n\nConcomitant use of somatostatin analogues \n\nSomatostatin and its analogues competitively bind to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the \n\nefficacy of Lutathera (see section 4.5). \n\n \n\nNeuroendocrine hormonal crises \n\nCrises due to excessive release of hormones or bioactive substances may occur following treatment \n\nwith Lutathera, therefore observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation should be considered in \n\nsome cases (e.g. patients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In case of hormonal crises, \n\nrecommended treatments are: intravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, intravenous fluids, \n\ncorticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea and/or vomiting. \n\n \n\nTumour lysis syndrome \n\nTumour lysis syndrome has been reported following therapy with medicines containing lutetium \n\n(177Lu). Patients with a history of renal insufficiency and high tumour burden may be at greater risk \n\nand should be treated with increased caution. Renal function as well as electrolyte balance should be \n\nassessed at baseline and during treatment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\nRadioprotection rules \n\nLutathera should always be infused through an intravenous catheter placed exclusively for its infusion. \n\nThe adequate position of the catheter should be checked before and during infusion. \n\n \n\nThe patient treated with Lutathera should be kept away from others during the administration and up \n\nto reaching the radiation emission limits stipulated by applicable laws, usually within the 4-5 hours \n\nfollowing medicinal product administration. The nuclear medicine physician should determine when \n\nthe patient can leave the controlled area of the hospital, i.e. when the radiation exposure to third parties \n\ndoes not exceed regulatory thresholds. \n\n \n\nThe patient should be encouraged to urinate as much as possible after Lutathera administration. \n\nPatients should be instructed to drink substantial quantities of water (1 glass every hour) on the day of \n\ninfusion and the day after to facilitate elimination. The patient should also be encouraged to defecate \n\nevery day and to use laxative if needed. Urine and faeces should be disposed according to the national \n\nregulations. \n\n \n\nAs long as the patient’s skin is not contaminated, such as from the leakage of the infusion system or \n\nbecause of urinary incontinence, radioactivity contamination is not expected on the skin and in the \n\nvomited mass. However, it is recommended that when conducting standard care or exams with \n\nmedical devices or other instruments which contact the skin (e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG)), basic \n\nprotection measures should be observed such as wearing gloves, installing the material/electrode \n\nbefore the start of radiopharmaceutical infusion, changing the material/electrode after measurement, \n\nand eventually monitoring the radioactivity of equipment after use. \n\n \n\nBefore the patient is released, the nuclear physician should explain the necessary radioprotection rules \n\nof interacting with family members and third parties, and the general precautions the patient must \n\nfollow during daily activities after treatment (as given in next paragraph and the package leaflet) to \n\nminimize radiation exposure to others. \n\nClose contact (less than 1 meter) with other people should be limited for 7 days following an \n\nadministration of Lutathera. For children and/or pregnant women, close contact (less than 1 meter) \n\nshould be limited to less than 15 minutes per day for 7 days. Patients should sleep in a separate \n\nbedroom from other people for 7 days following an administration of Lutathera. Patients should sleep \n\nin separate bedrooms from children and/or pregnant women for 15 days. \n\n \n\nRecommended measures in case of extravasation \n\nDisposable waterproof gloves should be worn. The infusion of the medicinal product must be \n\nimmediately ceased and the administration device (catheter, etc.) removed. The nuclear medicine \n\nphysician and the radiopharmacist should be informed. \n\nAll the administration device materials should be kept in order to measure the residual radioactivity \n\nand the activity actually administered and eventually the absorbed dose should be determined. The \n\nextravasation area should be delimited with an indelible pen and a picture should be taken if possible. \n\nIt is also recommended to record the time of extravasation and the estimated volume extravasated. \n\nTo continue Lutathera infusion, it is mandatory to use a new catheter possibly placing it in a \n\ncontralateral venous access. \n\n \n\nNo additional medicinal product can be administered to the same side where the extravasation \n\noccurred. \n\nIn order to accelerate medicinal product dispersion and to prevent its stagnation in tissue, it is \n\nrecommended to increase blood flow by elevating the affected arm. Depending on the case, aspiration \n\nof extravasation fluid, sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection flush injection, or \n\napplying warm compresses or a heating pad to the infusion site to accelerate vasodilation should be \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nSymptoms, especially inflammation and/or pain, should be treated. Depending on the situation, the \n\nnuclear medicine physician should inform the patient about the risks linked to extravasation injury, \n\nand give advice about potential treatment and necessary follow-up requirements. The extravasation \n\narea must be monitored until the patient is discharged from the hospital. Depending upon its \n\nseriousness, this event should be declared as an adverse reaction. \n\n \n\nPatients with urinary incontinence \n\nDuring the first 2 days following administration of this medicinal product, special precautions should \n\nbe taken with patients with urinary incontinence to avoid spread of radioactive contamination. This \n\nincludes the handling of any materials possibly contaminated with urine. \n\n \n\nPatients with brain metastases \n\nThere is no efficacy data in patients with known brain metastases therefore individual benefit-risk \n\nmust be assessed in these patients. \n\n \n\nSecondary malignant neoplasms \n\nExposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of \n\nhereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher \n\nincidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation \n\nexposure are less than from the disease itself. \n\n \n\nOther patients with risk factors \n\nA patient presenting with any of the conditions below is more prone to develop adverse reactions. \n\nTherefore, it is recommended to monitor those patients more frequently during the treatment. Please \n\nsee Table 3 in case of dose modifying toxicity. \n\n Bone metastasis; \n\n Previous oncologic radiometabolic therapies with 131Icompounds or any other therapy using \n\nunshielded radioactive sources; \n\n History of other malignant tumours unless the patient is considered to be in remission for at \n\nleast 5 years. \n\n \n\nSpecific warnings \n\nThis medicinal product contains up to 3.5 mmol (81.1 mg) sodium per dose, equivalent to 4% of the \n\nWHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n\n \n\nPrecautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6. \n\n \n\nSpecific warnings and precautions regarding the co-administered renal protective amino acid solution \n\n \n\nHyperkalemia \n\nA transient increase in serum potassium levels may occur in patients receiving arginine and lysine, \n\nusually returning to normal levels within 24 hours from the start of the amino acid infusion. \n\nSerum potassium levels must be tested before each treatment with amino acid solutions. In case of \n\nhyperkalemia, patient’s history of hyperkalemia and concomitant medication should be checked. \n\nHyperkalemia must be corrected accordingly before starting the infusion. \n\nIn case of pre-existing clinically significant hyperkalemia, a second monitoring prior to amino acid \n\ninfusion must confirm that hyperkalemia has been successfully corrected. The patient should be \n\nmonitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnea, weakness, numbness, chest \n\npain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). An \n\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed prior to discharging the patient. \n\nVital signs should be monitored during the infusion regardless of baseline serum potassium levels. \n\nPatients should be instructed to drink substantial quantities of water (at least 1 glass every hour) on the \n\nday of infusion to remain hydrated and facilitate excretion of excess serum potassium. \n\nIn case hyperkalemia symptoms develop during amino acid infusion, appropriate corrective measures \n\nmust be taken. In case of severe symptomatic hyperkalemia, discontinuation of amino acid solution \n\ninfusion should be considered, taking into consideration the risk-benefit of renal protection versus \n\nacute hyperkalemia. \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nHeart failure \n\nDue to potential for clinical complications related to volume overload, care should be taken with use \n\nof arginine and lysine in patients with severe heart failure defined as class III or class IV in the NYHA \n\nclassification (New York Heart Association). Patients with severe heart failure defined as class III or \n\nclass IV in the NYHA classification should only be treated after careful benefit-risk assessment, taking \n\ninto consideration volume and osmolality of the amino acid solution. \n\n \n\nMetabolic acidosis \n\nMetabolic acidosis has been observed with complex amino-acid solutions administered as part of total \n\nparenteral nutrition (TPN) protocols. Shifts in acid-base balance alter the balance of extracellular-\n\nintracellular potassium and the development of acidosis may be associated with rapid increases in \n\nplasma potassium. \n\n \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \n\nSomatostatin and its analogues competitively bind to somatostatin receptors and may interfere with the \n\nefficacy of Lutathera. Therefore, administration of long acting somatostatin analogues should be \n\navoided within 30 days prior to the administration of this medicinal product. If necessary, patients may \n\nbe treated with short acting somatostatin analogues until at least 24 hours preceding Lutathera \n\nadministration. \n\n \n\nThere is some evidence that corticosteroids can induce down-regulation of SST2 receptors. Therefore, \n\nas a matter of cautiousness, repeated administration of high-doses of glucocorticosteroids should be \n\navoided during Lutathera treatment. Patients with a history of chronic use of glucocorticosteroids \n\nshould be carefully evaluated for sufficient somatostatin receptor expression. It is not known if there is \n\nof interaction between glucocorticosteroids used intermittently for the prevention of nausea and \n\nvomiting during Lutathera administration. Therefore, glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as \n\npreventive anti-emetic treatment. In the case where the treatments previously provided for nausea and \n\nvomiting are insufficient, a single dose of corticosteroids can be used, as long as it is not given before \n\ninitiating or within one hour after the end of Lutathera infusion. \n\n \n\nThe absence of inhibition or significant induction of the human CYP450 enzymes, the absence of \n\nspecific interaction with P-glycoprotein (efflux transporter) as well as OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, \n\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP transporters in pre-clinical studies suggest that Lutathera has a low \n\nprobability of causing significant other drug-drug interactions. \n\n \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \n\nWomen of childbearing potential \n\nWhen an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is \n\nimportant to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be \n\nassumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in any doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the \n\nwoman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using \n\nionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of Lutathera, \n\npregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test. \n\n \n\nContraception in males and females \n\nLutathera can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. During treatment with \n\nLutathera and for a minimum of the following 6 months after the end of the treatment, appropriate \n\nmeasures must be taken to avoid pregnancy; this applies to patients of both genders. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nPregnancy \n\nNo studies on animal reproductive function have been conducted with lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide. \n\nRadionuclide procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation dose to the foetus. The \n\nuse of Lutathera is contraindicated during established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has \n\nnot been excluded due to the risk associated with the ionizing radiation (see section 4.3). Pregnant \n\nwomen should be advised of the risk to a foetus. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nIt is unknown whether lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is excreted in breast milk. A risk to the suckling \n\nchild associated with ionising radiation cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be avoided during \n\ntreatment with this medicinal product. If treatment with Lutathera during breast-feeding is necessary, \n\nthe child must be weaned. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nNo animal studies have been performed to determine the effects of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide on \n\nthe fertility of either gender. Ionizing radiations of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide may potentially have \n\ntemporary toxic effects on female and male gonads. Genetic consultation is recommended if the \n\npatient wishes to have children after treatment. Cryopreservation of sperm or eggs can be discussed as \n\nan option to patients before the treatment. \n\n \n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \n\nLutathera has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Nevertheless, the \n\ngeneral condition of the patient and the possible adverse reactions to treatment must be taken into \n\naccount before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n\n \n\nSummary of safety profile \n\nThe overall safety profile of Lutathera is based on pooled data from patients from clinical trials \n\n(NETTER-1 phase III and Erasmus phase I/II Dutch patients) and from compassionate use programs. \n\n \n\nThe most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Lutathera treatment were nausea and \n\nvomiting which occurred at the beginning of the infusion in 58.9% and 45.5% of patients, \n\nrespectively. The causality of nausea / vomiting is confounded by the emetic effect of the concomitant \n\namino acids infusion administered for renal protection. \n\n \n\nDue to the bone marrow toxicity of Lutathera, the most expected adverse reactions were related to \n\nhaematological toxicity: thrombocytopenia (25%), lymphopenia (22.3%), anaemia (13.4%), \n\npancytopenia (10.2%). \n\n \n\nOther very common adverse reactions reported include fatigue (27.7%) and decreased appetite \n\n(13.4%). \n\n \n\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions are listed in Table 5 according to the frequency and the MedDRA System Organ \n\nClass (SOC). The frequencies are categorized as follows: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to \n\n<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not \n\nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nTable 5.

(myelo-/hematotoxicity) manifested with reversible / transient reductions in \n\nblood counts affecting all lineages (cytopenias in all combinations, i.e., pancytopenia, bicytopenias, \n\nisolated monocytopenias – anemia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). In spite of \n\nan observed significant selective B-cell depletion, no increase in the rate of infectious complications \n\noccurs after PRRT. Cases of irreversible hematological pathologies, i.e., premalignant and malignant \n\nblood neoplasms (i.e., myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively) have been \n\nreported following Lutathera treatment. \n\n \n\nNephrotoxicity \n\nLutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is excreted by the kidney. \n\nThe long-term trend of progressive glomerular filtration function deterioration demonstrated in the \n\nclinical studies confirms that Lutathera-related nephropathy is a chronic kidney disease that develops \n\nprogressively over months or years after exposure. An individual benefit-risk assessment is \n\nrecommended prior to treatment with Lutathera in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, \n\nfor additional details see section 4.2 (Table 3) and section 4.4. The use of Lutathera is contraindicated \n\nin patients with severe kidney failure (see section 4.3). \n\n \n\nHormonal crises \n\nHormonal crises related to bioactive substances release (probably due to lysis of the neuroendocrine \n\ntumour cells) have rarely been observed and resolved after appropriate medical treatment (section 4.4). \n\n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \n\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \n\nlisted in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n4.9 Overdose \n \n\nOverdose is unlikely with Lutathera as this medicinal product is supplied as a “single dose” and “ready \n\nto use” product containing a predefined amount of radioactivity. In the case of overdose, an increase in \n\nthe frequency of the adverse reactions related to radiotoxicity is expected. \n\n \n\nIn the event of administration of a radiation overdose with Lutathera, the absorbed dose to the patient \n\nshould be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by \n\nfrequent micturition or by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding during the first 48 hours after \n\ninfusion. It is helpful to estimate the effective dose that was applied. \n\n \n\nThe following checking should be carried out every week, for the next 10 weeks: \n\n Hematologic monitoring: white blood cells, platelets, and haemoglobin \n\n Blood chemistry monitoring: serum creatinine and glycaemia. \n\n \n\n \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n\n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10XX04 \n\n \n\nMechanism of action \n\nLutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide has a high affinity for subtype 2 somatostatin receptors (sst2). It binds \n\nto malignant cells which overexpress sst2 receptors. \n\nLutetium-177 (177Lu) is a β- emitting radionuclide with a maximum penetration range in tissue of \n\n2.2 mm (mean penetration range of 0.67 mm), which is sufficient to kill targeted tumour cells with a \n\nlimited effect on neighbouring normal cells. \n\n \n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAt the concentration used (about 10 μg/mL in total, for both free and radiolabeled forms), the peptide \n\noxodotreotide does not exert any clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effect. \n\n \n\nClinical efficacy and safety \n\nNETTER-1 phase III study was a multicentre stratified, open labelled, randomized, \n\ncomparator-controlled, parallel-group study comparing treatment with Lutathera (4 doses of \n\n7,400 MBq every 8 weeks) co-administered with amino acid solution plus best supportive care (BSC; \n\noctreotide long acting release [LAR] 30 mg every 4 weeks for symptoms control, replaced by short \n\nacting octreotide in the 4 weeks interval before Lutathera administration) to high dose octreotide LAR \n\n(60 mg every 4 weeks) in patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor positive, midgut \n\ncarcinoid tumours. The primary endpoint for the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated \n\nby response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST 1.1), based on independent radiology \n\nassessment. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), time \n\nto tumour progression (TTP), safety and tolerability of the medicinal product and quality of life (QoL). \n\nTwo hundred twenty-nine (229) patients have been randomized to receive either Lutathera (n=116) or \n\nhigh dose 60 mg octreotide LAR (n=113). Demographics as well as patients and disease \n\ncharacteristics were well balanced between groups with a median age of 64 years and 82.1% \n\nCaucasian in the general population. \n\n \n\nAt the time of final per-protocol PFS statistical analysis (cut–off date 24 July 2015), the number of \n\ncentrally confirmed disease progressions or deaths was 21 events in the Lutathera arm and 70 events in \n\nthe octreotide LAR arm (Table 6). PFS differed significantly (p<0.0001) between the treatment \n\ngroups. The median PFS for Lutathera was not reached at the time of analysis whereas the one of \n\noctreotide LAR was 8.5 months. The hazard ratio for Lutathera was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11 - 0.29), \n\nindicating 82% reduction in the risk for a patient to progress or die under Lutathera compared to \n\noctreotide LAR. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nTable 6.

PFS Kaplan Meier curves of patients with progressive midgut carcinoid tumour - cut-off \n\ndate 30 June 2016 (NETTER-1 phase III study; FAS, N=231) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nWith respect to overall survival OS, at the time of interim analysis (24 July 2015), there were \n\n17 deaths in the Lutathera arm and 31 in octreotide LAR 60 mg arm and the hazard ratio was 0.459 in \n\nfavour of Lutathera, but did not reach the level of significance for interim analysis (HR 99.9915% CI: \n\n0.140, 1.506). OS median was 27.4 months in octreotide LAR arm and was not reached in Lutathera \n\narm. An update conducted about one year after (30 June 2016) showed similar trend with 28 deaths in \n\nthe Lutathera arm and 43 in octreotide LAR 60 mg arm, an HR of 0.536, and a median OS of \n\n27.4 months in octreotide LAR arm and still not reached in Lutathera arm. The final OS analysis is \n\nforeseen after 158 cumulative deaths. \n\n \n\nHealth Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) was assessed using the European Organisation for Research \n\nand Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) (generic instrument) and \n\nits neuroendocrine tumour module (EORTC QLQ-GI.NET-21). \n\nThe results indicate an improvement in the overall global health-related quality of life up to week 84, \n\nfor patients on Lutathera treatment as compared to patients on Octreotide LAR. \n \n\nErasmus phase I/II study was a monocentric single arm open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of \n\nLutathera (7,400 MBq administered for 4 times every 8 weeks) co-administered with amino acid \n\nsolution in patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumours. The mean age of patients enrolled in \n\nthe study was 60 years. Most patients were Dutch (811) with the remaining (403) residents of various \n\nEuropean and non-European countries. The main analysis has been conducted on 811 Dutch patients \n\nwith different somatostatin receptor positive tumour types. The ORR (including complete response \n\n(CR) and partial response (PR) according to RECIST criteria) and duration of response (DoR) for the \n\nFAS Dutch population with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and bronchial NETs (360 patients) as well \n\nas per tumour type are presented in Table 8. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nTable 8.

No statistically significant difference in PFS \n\nwas observed between the subgroup of patients who did not receive octreotide LAR (25.4 months \n\n[95% CI 22.8-30.6]) versus the subgroup who did receive concomitant treatment with octreotide LAR \n\n(30.9 months [95% CI 25.6-34.8]) (p= 0.747). \n\n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \n\nLutathera in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of GEP-NETs (excluding \n\nneuroblastoma, neuroganglioblastoma, phaeochromocytoma). See section 4.2. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n\n \n\nAbsorption \n\nThe medicinal product is administered intravenously and is immediately and completely bioavailable. \n\n \n\nOrgan uptake \n\nAt 4 hours after administration, the distribution pattern of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide shows a rapid \n\nuptake in kidneys, tumour lesions, liver and spleen, and in some patients in the pituitary gland and in \n\nthe thyroid. The co-administration of amino acid solution decreases the kidney uptake, enhancing the \n\nelimination of radioactivity (see section 4.4). Biodistribution studies show that lutetium (177Lu) \n\noxodotreotide is rapidly cleared from the blood. \n\nAn analysis performed with human plasma to determine the extent of plasma protein binding of \n\nnon-radioactive compound (lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide) showed that about 50% of the compound \n\nis bound to plasmatic proteins. \n\nTranschelation of lutetium from lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide into serum proteins has not been \n\nobserved. \n\n \n\nBiotransformation \n\nThere is evidence, from the analysis of urine samples of 20 patients included in the NETTER-1 phase \n\nIII Dosimetry, pharmacokinetic and ECG substudy, that lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide is poorly \n\nmetabolized and is excreted mainly as intact compound by renal route. \n\nThe high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses performed on urine samples collected \n\nup to 48 hours post infusion showed lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide radiochemical purity close to \n\n100% in most of the analysed samples (with lowest radiochemical purity value being greater than \n\n92%), indicating that the compound is eliminated in urine mainly as intact compound. \n\nThis evidence confirms what has been previously observed in the Erasmus phase I/II study, in which \n\nHPLC analysis of a urine specimen collected 1 hour post administration of lutetium (177Lu) \n\noxodotreotide from one patient receiving 1.85 MBq of lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide indicated that \n\nthe main portion (91%) was excreted unchanged. \n\nThese finding are supported by in vitro metabolism data in human hepatocytes, in which no metabolic \n\ndegradation of lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide was observed. \n\n \n\nElimination \n\nBased on the data collected during the Erasmus phase I/II and NETTER-1 phase III studies, lutetium \n\n(177Lu) oxodotreotide is primarily eliminated by renal excretion: about 60% of the medicinal product is \n\neliminated in the urine within 24 hours, and about 65% within 48 hours following the administration. \n\n \n\nElderly: \n\nThe pharmacokinetics profile in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) has not been established. No data are \n\navailable. \n\n \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \n\nToxicological studies with rats have demonstrated that a single intravenous injection of up to \n\n4,550 MBq/kg was well tolerated and no deaths were observed. When testing the cold compound \n\n(non-radioactive lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide) as a single intravenous injection in rats and dogs at \n\ndoses up to 20,000 µg/kg (rats) and 3,200 µg/kg (dogs), the compound was well tolerated in both \n\nspecies and no deaths were observed. Toxicity with four repeated administrations, once every 2 weeks, \n\nof 1,250 µg/kg of the cold compound in rats and 80 µg/kg in dogs was not observed. This medicinal \n\nproduct is not intended for regular or continuous administration. \n\nMutagenicity studies und long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out. \n\nNon-clinical data on the cold compound (non-radioactive lutetium (175Lu) oxodotreotide) reveal no \n\nspecial hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose \n\ntoxicity, genotoxicity. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n6.

Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the \n\nregulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. \n\n \n\nRadiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and \n\npharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. \n\n \n\nFor instruction on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. \n\n \n\nIf at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of this container and vial is \n\ncompromised it should not be used. \n\n \n\nAdministration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the \n\nmedicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. \n\nIt is necessary to wear waterproof gloves and suitable aseptic techniques when handling the medicinal \n\nproduct. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nThe administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or \n\ncontamination from spill of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with \n\nnational regulations must therefore be taken. \n\n \n\nThe surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the \n\nlocation and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive \n\ndetermination of overall radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time \n\nof close contact with patients injected with Lutathera. The use of television monitor systems to \n\nmonitor the patients is recommended. Given the half-life of 177Lu it is specially recommended to avoid \n\ninternal contamination. It is necessary to use protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves to avoid \n\ndirect contact with the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe). For minimising radiation exposure, always \n\nuse the principles of time, distance and shielding (reducing the manipulation of the vial and using the \n\nmaterial already supplied par the manufacturer). \n\n \n\nThis preparation is likely to result in a relatively high radiation dose to most patients. The \n\nadministration of 7,400 MBq may result in significant environmental hazard. \n\nThis may be of concern to the immediate family of those individuals undergoing treatment or the \n\ngeneral public depending on the level of activity administered, hence radioprotection rules should be \n\nfollowed (section 4.4). Suitable precautions in accordance with national regulations should be taken \n\nconcerning the activity eliminated by the patients in order to avoid any contaminations. \n\n \n\nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed according to local requirements. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nLutathera 370 MBq/mL solution for infusion \n\nLutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide \n\n \n\nThis medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new \n\nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 \n\nfor how to report side effects. \n\n \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important \n\ninformation for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n\n- If you have any further questions, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n\n- If you get any side effects, talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n\n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet \n\n \n\n1. What Lutathera is and what it is used for \n\n2. What you need to know before Lutathera is used \n\n3. How Lutathera is used \n\n4. Possible side effects \n\n5. How Lutathera is stored \n\n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n\n \n\n \n\n1. What Lutathera is and what it is used for \n\n \n\nLutathera is a radiopharmaceutical medicine used for the treatment of certain tumours \n\n(gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours), which cannot be completely removed from your \n\nbody by surgery, have spread in your body (metastatic) and does not respond more to your current \n\ntreatment. The tumour needs to have somatostatin receptors on the surface of its cells in order for the \n\nmedicine to be effective. Lutathera binds with these receptors and emits radioactivity directly into the \n\ntumour cells, causing their death. \n\n \n\nThe use of Lutathera does involve exposure to amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear \n\nmedicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with \n\nthe radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. \n\n \n\nIn addition to administration of Lutathera, an infusion with amino acids will be given to you in order \n\nto protect your kidneys as well as medicines (antiemetics) to avoid nausea and vomiting that may be \n\ncaused by amino acid infusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n2. What you need to know before Lutathera is used  \n \n\nLutathera must not be used \n\n- if you are allergic to lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide or any of the other ingredients of this \n\nmedicine (listed in section 6) \n\n- if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant or it is not confirmed if you are pregnant \n\n- if your kidneys are seriously impaired \n\n \n\nWarnings and precautions \n\nTalk to your doctor before you are given Lutathera as it may cause: \n\n- secondary blood cancer (myelodisplastic syndrome or acute leukaemia) which can rarely occur \n\nseveral years after you have completed Lutathera treatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nIf any of these apply to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist or healthcare provider before receiving \n\nLutathera, as well as during treatment with Lutathera: \n\n- If you had or have weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, poor concentration, frequent \n\ninfections, fever, easily bleeding or difficulty to stop bleeding (signs and symptoms of \n\nmyelossupression). Tell your doctor if you had other type of cancer within the last 5 years, bone \n\nmetastasis, previous anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy) or radiation therapy. \n\n- If you had or have swollen feet and ankle, too much urine or not enough urine, itching or \n\ntrouble catching your breath (signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease). \n\n- If you had or have any itchy yellow skin or if the whites of your eye turn yellow, nausea or \n\nvomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, pain in the upper right side of your stomach area (abdomen), \n\ndark or brown urine, or you bleed or bruise more easily than normal (signs and symptoms of \n\nliver disease). \n\n- If you have breathlessness, weakness, numbness, chest pain, palpitations or abnormal heart \n\nrhythm (signs and symptoms of high potassium levels in blood (hyperkalemia)). \n\n- If you have breathlessness, difficulty breathing when lying down or swelling of the feet or legs \n\n(signs and symptoms of heart failure). \n\n- If your kidney or urinary tract is not correctly developed. \n\n- If you are suffering from urinary incontinence. \n\n \n\nTreatment with Lutathera (lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, due to \n\nthe rapid breakdown of tumour cells. This may result in abnormal blood test results, irregular \n\nheartbeat, kidney failure or seizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will perform blood tests \n\nto monitor you for this syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, \n\nconfusion, or shortness of breath. \n\n \n\nUnless your doctor has considered that the clinical benefit of  the treatment overcomes the possible \n\nrisks, you will not be given this medicine: \n\n- if you have received a previous external radiation therapy on more than 25% of your bone \n\nmarrow \n\n- if you heart is seriously impaired \n\n- if you have seriously affected blood cell counts \n\n- if your liver is seriously impaired \n\n- if it appears that your tumour does not have sufficient somatostatin receptors \n\n \n\nChildren and adolescents \n\nThe safety and efficacy of this medicine has not yet been established in children and adolescents under \n\n18 years of age. Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old. \n\n \n\nOther medicines and Lutathera \nTell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \n\nmedicines including somatostatin analogues, glucocorticoids (also called corticosteroids), since they \n\nmay interfere with your treatment. If you are taking somatostatin analogues you might be asked to stop \n\nand/or adapt your treatment for a short period of time. \n\n \n\nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \n\nyour nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. \n\n \n\nLutathera is contraindicated in pregnant women, as ionizing radiation is dangerous for the foetus. \n\nBreast-feeding should be avoided during treatment with this medicinal product. If treatment with \n\nLutathera during breast-feeding is necessary, the child must be weaned. \n\nYou must inform the nuclear medicine doctor before the administration of Lutathera if there is a \n\npossibility you might be pregnant or if you have missed your period or if you are breast-feeding. \n\nWhen in doubt, it is important to consult your nuclear medicine doctor who will supervise the \n\nprocedure. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\nDuring treatment with Lutathera and for a minimum of the following 6 months after the end of the \n\ntreatment, appropriate measures must be taken to avoid pregnancy; this applies to patients of both \n\ngenders. \n\n \n\nFertility \n\nIonizing radiations of the medicine may potentially decrease your fertility. Genetic consultation is \n\nrecommended if you wish to have children after treatment. Cryopreservation of sperm or eggs may be \n\noffered to you before the treatment. \n\n \n\nDriving and using machines \nIt is considered unlikely that Lutathera will affect your ability to drive or to use machines; however, \n\nyour general condition and the possible adverse reactions to treatment must be taken into account to \n\nassess this ability before driving or using machines. \n\n \n\nLutathera contains sodium \n\nThis medicine contains up to 81.1 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. \n\nThis is equivalent to 4% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n\n \n\n \n\n3. How Lutathera is used \n \n\nThere are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Lutathera will \n\nonly be used in special controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given to you by \n\npeople who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe \n\nuse of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions. \n\n \n\nThe recommended dose is 7,400 MBq (megabecquerel, the unit used to express radioactivity) in a \n\nsingle infusion, which is given at 4 times once every 8 weeks. \n\n \n\nAdministration of Lutathera and conduct of the procedure \nLutathera is administered directly into a vein. \n\n \n\nDue to the radiation emitted by this medicine, during the administration procedure, you should be \n\nisolated from other patients who are not receiving the same treatment. The doctor will inform you \n\nwhen you can leave the controlled area or the hospital. \n\n \n\nIn addition to administration of Lutathera, an infusion with amino acids will be given to you in order \n\nto protect your kidneys. This might induce nausea and vomiting; you will also receive an injection \n\nbefore the start of the treatment to reduce these symptoms. \n\n \n\nDuration of the procedure \nYour nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. \n\nThe medicine infusion takes 30 ±10 minutes; but the complete administration procedure will take \n\napproximately 5 hours. This treatment is given in 4 treatment cycles which are separated by 8 to \n\n16 weeks. Your doctor will regularly monitor your condition to check that the treatment is having the \n\ndesired effect. \n\n \n\nTreatment monitoring \nTreatment with Lutathera can have an impact on blood cells, liver and kidneys (see section 4). In \n\nconsequence, your doctor will ask you to have regular blood tests in order to check your eligibility for \n\nthis treatment and to detect any side effects as early as possible. Based on the results, your doctor may \n\ndecide to delay or stop your treatment with this medicine if necessary. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\nAfter administration of Lutathera \n\nYou will be requested to drink a sufficient amount of water (1 glass every hour) necessary to urinate \n\nevery hour on the day of infusion and the day after, and try to defecate every day, in order to eliminate \n\nthe medicine from your body. \n\nBecause this medicine is radioactive, you will have to follow the instructions described below to \n\nminimize radiation exposure to others. \n\nConsidering current knowledge and experience in this field and the physical and pharmaceutical \n\nproperties of the medicine, it is estimated that the health risks to your family members and the general \n\npublic are low. However, you must adhere to the following rules to maximize the safety of other \n\npersons. These rules are the result of many years of experience in the use of radioactivity in medicine, \n\nand they include recommendations issued by international organizations. \n\n \n\nGeneral rule \n\nYou should limit close contact with people who live with you by keeping a distance of at least one \n\nmeter for 7 days after you receive Lutathera. \n\n \n\nUse of toilets \n\nToilets must be used in a seated position, even for men. It is absolutely necessary to use toilet paper \n\neach time. It is also important to wash your hands to avoid contaminating the door handles. It is \n\nstrongly recommended to move your bowels every day and use a laxative if necessary. Furthermore, \n\ndrink frequently and try to urinate every hour on the day you received treatment and on the day after. \n\nFollow your doctor’s advice on how much fluid to drink. \n\n \n\nContact with children and/or pregnant women \n\nAfter your receive Lutathera, it is strongly recommended that you limit close contact (less than \n\n1 meter) with children and/or pregnant women to less than 15 minutes per day for 7 days. \n\n \n\nContact with spouse and people in the family circle \n\nYou should sleep in a separate bedroom from other people for 7 days after you receive Lutathera. You \n\nshould sleep in separate bedrooms from children and/or pregnant women for 15 days after you receive \n\nLutathera. \n\n \n\nBreast-feeding \n\nBreast-feeding must be stopped. If treatment with Lutathera during breast-feeding is necessary, the \n\nchild must be weaned. \n\n \n\nPregnancy \n\nIonizing radiation is dangerous for the foetus, therefore pregnancy is contraindicated. Men and women \n\nof child-bearing potential must refrain from procreation by using effective contraceptive methods \n\nduring the treatment and for 6 months after. \n\n \n\nPeople who need extra assistance \n\nPeople who are confined to the bed or have reduced mobility will preferably receive assistance by a \n\ncare provider. It is recommended that when providing assistance in the bathroom, the care provider \n\nwears disposable gloves for 7 days after administration. In the case of the use of special medical \n\nequipment such as catheters, colostomy bags bedpan, water nozzle, or anything that could be \n\ncontaminated by your body fluids these must be emptied immediately in the toilet and then cleaned. If \n\nanyone helps you clean up vomit, blood, urine, or stool they should wear plastic gloves; the gloves \n\nshould then be disposed of in a specific trash plastic bag (according to the recommendation stated in \n\nsection \"Trash recommendations\" below). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nDishes and bathroom accessories \n\nTake special precautions during the 7 days after treatment: \n\n- Flush all wipes and/or toilet paper down the toilet immediately after use, \n\n- Always wash your hands well after using the toilet, \n\n- Take a shower every day, \n\n- Flush any tissues or any other items that contain anything from your body, such as blood, urine \n\nand faeces down the toilet. Items that cannot be flushed down the toilet, such as menstrual pads \n\nand bandages, must be placed in specific trash plastic bags (according to the recommendation \n\nstated in section \"Trash recommendations\" below). \n\n- Wash your underwear, pyjamas, sheets and any clothes that contain sweat, blood or urine \n\nseparately from the laundry of other members of your household, using a standard washing \n\ncycle. You do not need to use bleach and do not need extra rinses. \n\n \n\nTrash recommendations \n\nKeep the specific plastic trash bags separated from the other trash; keep the bags away from children \n\nand animals. \n\n \n\nA member of the hospital staff will tell you how and when to get rid of these trash bags. You might be \n\nasked to bring the bag back to your treatment facility, or, after 70 days, the bag may be removed as the \n\nother household waste. \n\n \n\nHospitalisation and Emergency Care \n\nIf for any reason you require emergency medical assistance or unplanned hospitalisation occurs during \n\nthe 3 months after your treatment, you should inform the medical providers about the nature, the date \n\nand the dose of your radioactive treatment. To facilitate that, carry your discharge letter with you at all \n\ntimes. \n\n \n\nTravel \n\nKeep the discharge letter with you whenever you are travelling for at least 3 months after treatment. \n\n \n\nThe Nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after \n\nreceiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. \n\n \n\nIf you have been given more Lutathera than you should \nAn overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Lutathera precisely controlled \n\nby the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the administration procedure. However, in the case of an \n\noverdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. \n\nShould you have any further question on the use of this medicine, please ask the nuclear medicine \n\ndoctor who supervises the procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Possible side effects \n \n\nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n\nLutathera side effects are mainly linked to radioactivity. \n\nThe most common side effect seen in patients being treated with Lutathera is the impact on the bone \n\nmarrow. This can lead to the decrease of the different types of blood cells, most importantly, red blood \n\ncells (responsible for transporting the oxygen from the lungs to the different organs), platelets (a \n\nspecial cell which helps the blood to clot), and other blood cells such as white blood cells (helps to \n\nfight infection). This happens in many patients and is frequently temporary. However, in rare cases the \n\ndecrease in blood cells may be long standing and/or permanent. \n\nAs a consequence, a decrease in the various blood cell types may put you at risk for bleeding, fatigue, \n\nshortness of breath, and infection. If this does occur to you, your doctor may decide to delay or stop \n\nthe treatment administration. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nSome side effects could be serious \n\nIf you experience any serious side effects, tell your doctor immediately. \n\n \n\nVery common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people \n\n Spontaneous bleeding or bruising (possible signs of low level of blood platelets)
