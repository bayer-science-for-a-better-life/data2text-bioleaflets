The molecular weight of the protein \nis approximately 234 kDa. \n \nJivi is produced without the addition of any human or animal derived protein in the cell culture \nprocess, purification, PEGylation or final formulation.  \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPowder: solid, white to slightly yellow. \nSolvent: clear solution. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients \u2265 12 years of age with \nhaemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nTreatment monitoring \n \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to confirm \nthat adequate FVIII levels have been achieved. Individual patients may vary in their response to \nfactor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require \nadjustment in overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise \nmonitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is \nindispensable. \n \nWhen using an in vitro activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for \ndetermining factor VIII activity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be \nsignificantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay, \nwhich can result in over- or under-estimation of factor VIII activity. It should be noted that there can \nbe significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by specific reagents used in the aPTT-\nbased one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay. This is of importance when monitoring the \nfactor VIII activity of Jivi, and when changing laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. This \napplies also for modified long acting factor VIII products. \nLaboratories intending to measure Jivi activity should check their procedures for accuracy. A field \nstudy has indicated that the factor VIII activity of Jivi can be accurately measured in plasma using \neither a validated chromogenic substrate (CS) assay or a one-stage (OS) clotting assay using specific \nreagents. For Jivi some silica-based one-stage assays (e.g., APTT-SP, STA-PTT) may underestimate \nthe factor VIII activity of Jivi in plasma samples; some reagents, e.g. with kaolin-based activators, \nhave the potential for overestimation. \n \nThe clinical effect of factor VIII is the most important element in evaluating the effectiveness of \ntreatment. It may be necessary to adjust the individual dosing at patient level in order to attain \nsatisfactory clinical results. If the calculated dose fails to attain the expected factor VIII levels or if \nbleeding is not controlled after administration of the calculated dosage, the presence of a circulating \nfactor VIII-inhibitor or anti-PEG antibodies in the patient should be suspected (see section 4.4). \n \nPosology \n \nThe dose and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the \nlocation and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \nThe number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are \nrelated to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in \nplasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in IU \n(relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). \n \nOne IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one mL of normal human \nplasma.  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nOn demand treatment \n \nThe calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU \nfactor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5-2.5 % of normal activity. \nThe required dose of Jivi is determined using the following formula: \n \nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed \nrecovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the \nclinical effectiveness required in the individual case.  \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the \ngiven plasma activity level (in % of normal) in the corresponding period. The following table can be \nused to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \nTable 1: Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery for adolescents and adults \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage/Type \nof surgical procedure \n\n \n\nFactor VIII level \nrequired (%) \n\n(IU/dL) \n\nFrequency of doses (hours) / Duration of \ntherapy (days) \n\nHaemorrhage \n \nEarly haemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or oral bleeding \n \n\n20-40 \n\n \n \nRepeat injection every 24-48 hours. \nAt least 1 day, until bleeding episode as \nindicated by pain is resolved or healing is \nachieved \n \n\nMore extensive \nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or haematoma \n \n\n30-60 \nRepeat injection every 24-48 hours for \n3 to 4 days or more until pain and acute \ndisability are resolved. \n\nLife-threatening  \n \nHaemorrhages \n \n\n \n60-100 \n\n \n \nRepeat injection every 8 to 24 hours until \nthreat is resolved. \n\nSurgery \n \nMinor surgery \nincluding tooth extraction \n \n\n30-60 \n\n \n \nEvery 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is \nachieved. \n\nMajor surgery \n \n\n80-100 (pre- and \npost-operative) \n\nRepeat dose every  \n12-24 hours until adequate wound healing, \nthen therapy for at least another 7 days to \nmaintain factor VIII activity of 30-60% \n(IU/dL). \n\n \nProphylaxis \n \nAll treatment decisions for identifying appropriate prophylactic treatment regimens should be guided \nby clinical judgement based on individual patient characteristics and treatment response. \n \nFor prophylaxis the dose is 45-60 IU/kg every 5 days. Based on patient clinical characteristics the dose \ncan also be 60 IU/kg every 7 days or 30-40 IU/kg two times per week (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nFor overweight patients, the maximum dose per injection for prophylaxis should not be higher than \napproximately 6000 IU.  \n \nPaediatric population \nJivi is not indicated in previously untreated patients and in patients less than 12 years of age. \n \nAdolescent population \nOn demand and prophylactic treatment dosing in adolescent patients is the same as for adult patients. \n \nElderly population \nThere is limited experience in patients \u2265 65 years. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nJivi is for intravenous use. \n \nJivi should be injected intravenously over a period of 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume. \nThe rate of administration should be determined by the patient\u2019s comfort level (maximal rate of \ninjection: 2.5 mL/min). \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and \nthe package leaflet. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nKnown allergic reactions to mouse or hamster proteins. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nHypersensitivity \n \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Jivi. The medicinal product may contain \ntraces of mouse and hamster proteins. Hypersensitivity reactions could also be related to antibodies \nagainst PEG (see paragraph Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG)). If symptoms of \nhypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the medicinal product \nimmediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of \nhypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, \nhypotension, and anaphylaxis. Symptomatic treatment for hypersensitivity should be instituted as \nappropriate. In case of anaphylaxis or shock, the current medical standards for treatment should be \nimplemented. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nInhibitors \n \nThe formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the \nmanagement of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins \ndirected against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) \nper mL of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to \nthe severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first \n50 exposure days (ED) but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. Rarely, inhibitors \nmay develop after the first 50 exposure days. \n \nThe clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre \nposing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. \n \nIn general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for \nthe development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. \n \nIf the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with \nan appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with \nhigh levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should \nbe considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the \ncare of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. \n \nImmune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) \n \nA clinical immune response associated with anti-PEG antibodies, manifested as symptoms of acute \nhypersensitivity and/or loss of drug effect has been observed primarily within the first 4 exposure \ndays. Low post-injection factor VIII levels in the absence of detectable factor VIII inhibitors indicate \nthat loss of drug effect is likely due to anti-PEG antibodies; in such cases Jivi should be discontinued \nand patients switched to a previously effective factor VIII product. \n \nA significant decrease in the risk of an immune response to PEG was observed with an increase in age. \nThis effect may be related to a developmental change in immunity, and although it is difficult to define \na clear cut-off age for the change in risk, this phenomenon predominantly occurs in young children \nwith haemophilia. \n \nThe implications of any potential risk to affected patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to pegylated \nproteins are unknown. Data show that in the affected subjects, following discontinuation of Jivi, the \nanti-PEG IgM antibodies decreased in titre and became undetectable over time . No cross-reactivity of \nanti-PEG IgM antibodies with other unmodified factor VIII products was observed. All patients could \nbe successfully treated with their previous factor VIII products. \n \nCardiovascular events \n \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase \nthe cardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications \n \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including \nlocal infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and adolescents. \nJivi is not indicated in patients < 12 years of age and in previously untreated patients. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nSodium content \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteractions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have \nnot been reported. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence \nof haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding \nonly if clearly indicated. \n \nFertility \n \nIn the repeat dose systemic toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with Jivi, treatment related effects on \nmale reproductive organs were not seen (see section 5.3). The effect on fertility in humans is \nunknown. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nJivi has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the \ninjection site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, \nrestlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed and \nmay in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). \n \nDevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated \nwith factor VIII, including with Jivi (see section 5.1). If such inhibitors occur, the condition will \nmanifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialized \nhaemophilia centre be contacted. \n \nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials in PTPs were headache, cough and \npyrexia. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nA total of 221 patients constituted the safety population from three pivotal Phase I and III studies \n[PROTECT VIII]. Median time on study for the 148 patients \u226512 years of age was 713 days. The total \nnumber of exposure days (ED) was 18432 with a median of 131 ED (range: 1 to 309) per subject; \nmedian time in study for paediatric patients < 12 years was 237 days with a total of 3219 ED and \nmedian of 53 ED (range 1-68) per subject. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nThe table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and \nPreferred Term Level). Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials \n \nMedDRA Standard  \nSystem Organ Class  \n\nAdverse reactions  Frequency  \n \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders FVIII inhibition Uncommon (PTPs)* \n \n\nImmune system disorders Hypersensitivity common \nPsychiatric disorders Insomnia common \nNervous system disorders Headache very common \n\nDizziness common \nDysgeusia  uncommon \n\nVascular disorders Flushing uncommon \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders \n\nCough common \n\nGastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, Nausea, \nVomiting \n\ncommon \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Erythema***, Rash**** common \nPruritus uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration \nsite conditions \n\nInjection site reactions **, \nPyrexia \n\ncommon \n\n* Frequency is based on studies with all factor VIII products which included patients with severe \nhaemophilia A.

Median time on study was 713 days with a \nmedian of 131 exposure days (range: 1 to 309 days). \n \nFVIII inhibitors \nNo de novo or confirmed cases of inhibitor against factor VIII occurred. A single unconfirmed positive \nresult of a low titre of factor VIII inhibitor (1.7 BU/mL) was reported in one adult patient following a \nsurgery. \n \nAnti\u00acPEG antibodies \nImmunogenicity against PEG with development of specific IgM anti-PEG antibodies was observed in \none patient. The immune response was accompanied by a clinical hypersensitivity reaction after \n4 injections of Jivi. Antibodies to PEG disappeared after discontinuation of Jivi. \n \nPaediatric population \nIn completed clinical studies with 73 paediatric PTPs < 12 years (44 PTPs < 6 years, 29 PTPs \n6\u00ac<12 years), adverse reactions due to immune response to PEG were observed in children less than \n\n\n\n9 \n\n6 years of age. In 10 of 44  patients (23%) in the age group of younger than 6 years of age loss of drug \neffect due to neutralising anti-PEG antibodies during the first 4 exposure days was observed. In \n3 of 44  patients (7%), loss of drug effect was combined with hypersensitivity reactions (see \nsection 4.4). No triggers or predictors of the immune response to PEG could be identified. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere was one case of overdose in the clinical trials. No adverse events were reported. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. \n \nMechanism of action \n \nThe factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von \nWillebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a patient with \nhaemophilia, factor VIII binds to patient\u2019s von Willebrand factor. Activated factor VIII acts as a \ncofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. \nActivated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin \nand a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due \nto decreased levels or absence of factor VIII:C that results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal \norgans, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the \nplasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor \ndeficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. \n \nDamoctocog alfa pegol is a PEGylated form of rFVIII. Site-specific PEGylation reduces clearance of \nfactor VIII resulting in an extended half-life while maintaining the normal functions of the B-domain \ndeleted rFVIII molecule (see section 5.2). Damoctocog alfa pegol does not contain von Willebrand \nfactor. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nClinical studies \n \nA total of 232 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A have been exposed in the clinical \ntrial program which included one phase I study and two phase II/III studies. One-hundred and fifty \nnine (159) subjects were \u2265 12 years of age,  \n \nPhase II/III: The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Jivi for on demand treatment, prophylaxis \n\nwith three regimens (two times per week 30-40 IU/kg, every 5-days 45-60 IU/kg and every \n7-days 60 IU/kg) and haemostasis during major surgeries were evaluated in a multi-\nnational, open-label, uncontrolled, partially randomized study which was performed in \ncompliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. An extension study included \npatients completing the main study. The primary efficacy variable was annualized bleed \nrate (ABR). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nOne hundred and thirty four male PTPs received at least one injection of Jivi (including \n13 subjects aged 12 to 17 years of age) for prophylaxis (n=114) or on-demand treatment \n(n=20) for a period of 36 weeks. A total of 121 subjects received treatment during the \nextension study with a median duration of 464 days. Hemostasis during 20 major surgeries \nin 17 patients was evaluated in the surgery part. \n\n \nPhase III (Paediatric): Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of Jivi for three prophylaxis regimens \n\n(twice weekly, every 5 and every 7 days) and treatment of breakthrough bleeds were \nevaluated in a multi-national, uncontrolled, open-label trial in 73 paediatric patients \n(<12 years of age) during a period of 50 EDs and at least 6 months. This study has been \nperformed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. Sixty one subjects \n(83.6%) completed the main study and 59 patients continued in the optional extension \nstudy.  \n\n \nProphylactic treatment in subjects \u226512 years \n \nDuring the main study period subjects were assigned to prophylaxis 2x/week (n=24), or randomized to \nevery 5 days (n=43) or every 7 days (n=43) or received on-demand treatment (n=20) with Jivi. Ninety \nnine of 110 patients (90%) remained on the assigned regimen. Eleven patients in the every 7 days arm \nincreased frequency. The median dose for all prophylaxis regimens was 46.9 IU/kg/injection. The \nmedian (Q1; Q3) ABR during prophylaxis was 2.09 (0.0; 6.1) for all bleeds and 0.0 (0;0 4.2) for \nspontaneous bleeds as compared to 23.4 (18; 37) total bleeds in the on-demand group. Forty-two out \nof 110 in the prophylaxis arms (38.2%) experienced no bleeding episode.  \n \nDuring the extension study, 24 patients were treated 2x/week, 37 patients every 5-days, 29 patients \nevery 7 days and 17 patients changed treatment regimen. The median dose for prophylaxis was \n47.7 IU/kg. The overall median (Q1; Q3) total ABR was 1.17 (0.0; 4.3) and 0.6 (0.0: 3.2) for \nspontaneous bleeds in the combined prophylaxis groups and total ABR was 33.0 in the on-demand \ngroup. \nOf note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical \nstudies. \n \nTreatment of bleeding \n \nOf the 702 bleeding events treated with Jivi during the main study, 636 (90.6%) were treated with 1 or \n2 injections, thereof 81.1% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose per injection was 31.7 IU/kg \n(14; 62). During the extension, 942 bleeds were treated with Jivi and 92.3% were controlled with 1 or \n2 injections, thereof 83% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose was 37.3 (18; 66) IU/kg/injection. \n \nPerioperative Management  \n \nA total of 20 major surgical procedures were performed and assessed in 17 patients. The median total \ndose for major surgeries was 219 IU/kg (range: 50-1500 IU/kg, including postoperative period up to \n3 weeks). Perioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as good or excellent during all major surgeries. \nAdditional 34 minor surgeries were performed in 19 patients. Hemostasis was assessed as good or \nexcellent in all available cases. \n \nPaediatric population < 12 years of age \n \nThe use of Jivi in children below 12 years is not indicated (see section 4.2, for information on \npaediatric use).  \nA total of 73  previously treated pediatric patients (44 subjects < 6 years and 29 subjects \n6 to <12 years) received prophylaxis treatment twice weekly, every 5 days or every 7 days in the phase \nIII study. For 53 patients who completed the main study, the median (Q1; Q3) annualised bleeding rate \nwas 2.87 (1.1; 6.1) and the spontaneous ABR was 0.0 (0.0; 2.6). For treatment of bleeds, 84.4 % of the \nbleeds were resolved with 1 injection, and 91.9% of the bleeds were resolved with 1 or 2 injections. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n11 patients in the age group < 6 years dropped out due to an immune response to PEG associated with \nloss of efficacy and/or hypersensitivity reaction during the first four ED. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of Jivi was compared to that of factor VIII in a crossover Phase I study. \nPK was also evaluated in 22 subjects (\u226512 yrs) and in 16 of these subjects after 6 months of \nprophylaxis treatment in the Phase II/III study. \n \nThe PK data (based on chromogenic assay) indicated that Jivi has a reduced clearance (CL), resulting \nin a terminal half-life that is 1.4-fold longer and a dose normalized AUC which is 1.4-fold higher, as \ncompared to the comparative factor VIII product. Dose proportional increases were observed between \nthe doses of 25 and 60 IU/kg indicating dose linearity between 25 IU/kg and 60 IU/kg. \n \nTable 3 summarizes the PK parameters after single dose of 60 IU/kg from the Phase II/III study where \nPK was evaluated in 22 subjects.

In a long-term, 6-months chronic toxicity study no indication of PEG accumulation or \nother effects related to administration of Jivi were seen. In addition 4 weeks toxicity studies with the \nPEG moiety of Jivi were conducted in two species. The PEG-linker moiety was also tested in a \nstandard set of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies and they did not indicate a potential for \ngenotoxicity. These studies did not reveal any safety concerns for humans.  \n \nSingle dose studies in rats with the radio-labelled PEG moiety showed that there was no indication of \nretention or irreversible binding of radioactivity in the animal body. Specifically, no residual \nradioactivity was detected in the brain, indicating that the radio-labelled compound did not cross the \nblood brain barrier. In distribution and excretion studies in rats, the 60 kDa PEG moiety of Jivi was \nshown to be widely distributed to and eliminated from organs and tissues, and excreted in urine \n(68.4% up to day 231 after administration) and faeces (13.8% up to day 168 after administration). \n \nNo long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Jivi, or studies to determine \nthe effects of Jivi on reproduction have been conducted. \n \n \n6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nPowder \nSucrose \nHistidine \nGlycine \nSodium chloride \nCalcium chloride dihydrate \nPolysorbate 80 \nAcetic acid, glacial (for pH adjustment) \n \nSolvent \nWater for injections \n \n6.2 Incompatibilities \n \nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal \nproducts. \n \n\n\n\n13 \n\nOnly the components provided in the package should be used for reconstitution and injection because \ntreatment failure can occur as a consequence of factor VIII adsorption to the internal surfaces of some \ninjection equipment. \n \n6.3 Shelf\u00aclife \n \nUnopened vial \n \n2 years. \n \nReconstituted solution \n \nThe chemical and physical in-use stability after reconstitution has been demonstrated for 3 hours at \nroom temperature. Do not refrigerate after reconstitution. \nFrom a microbiological point of view the product should be used immediately after reconstitution. If \nnot used immediately, the in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the \nuser. \n \n6.4 Special precautions for storage \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C \u00ac 8 \u00b0C). \nDo not freeze.  \nKeep the vial and the pre-filled syringe in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nWithin its overall shelf life of 2 years, the product (when kept in its outer carton) may be stored at up \nto 25 \u00b0C for a limited period of 6 months. The end date of the 6 month storage period at a temperature \nup to 25 \u00b0C should be recorded on the product carton. This date should never exceed the expiry date \nprinted on the outer carton. At the end of this period the product should not be put back in the \nrefrigerator, but should be used or discarded. \n \nFor storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. \n \n6.5 Nature and contents of container \n \nEach single package of Jivi contains: \n\u2022 one vial with powder (10 mL clear type 1 glass vial with grey bromobutyl rubber blend stopper \n\nand aluminium seal) \n\u2022 one pre-filled syringe with 2.5 mL solvent (clear type 1 glass cylinder syringe with grey \n\nbromobutyl rubber blend stopper) \n\u2022 one syringe plunger rod \n\u2022 one vial adapter (with integrated filter) \n\u2022 one venipuncture set \n \nPack sizes \n\uf02d 1 single pack. \n\uf02d 1 multipack with 30 single packs.\u00a0\nNot all pack sizes may be marketed. \n \n6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling \n \nDetailed instructions for preparation and administration are contained in the package leaflet provided \nwith Jivi. \n \nJivi powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 mL water for injections) in the \nprefilled-syringe and the vial adapter. The medicinal product must be prepared for injection under \naseptic conditions. If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not use this component. \n\n\n\n14 \n\nAfter reconstitution the solution is clear and colourless and then drawn back into the syringe. \nParenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration \nprior to administration \n \nThe reconstituted product must be filtered prior to administration to remove potential particulate \nmatter in the solution. Filtering is achieved by using the vial adapter. \n \nJivi is for single use only. \nAny unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local \nrequirements. \n \n \n7.

What you need to know before you use Jivi \n3. How to use Jivi  \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Jivi  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Jivi is and what it is used for \n \nJivi contains the active substance damoctocog alfa pegol. It is produced by recombinant technology \nwithout addition of any human- or animal-derived components in the manufacturing process. \nFactor VIII is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to clot it. The protein in damoctocog \nalfa pegol has been modified (pegylated) to prolong its action in the body. \n \nJivi is used to treat and prevent bleeding in previously treated adults and adolescents aged from \n12 years with haemophilia A (hereditary factor VIII deficiency). It is not for use in children younger \nthan 12 years of age. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Jivi \n \nDo not use Jivi if you are \n\uf0b7 allergic to damoctocog alfa pegol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nsection 6). \n\uf0b7 allergic to mouse or hamster proteins. \n \nWarnings and precautions \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have \n\uf0b7 tightness in the chest, fall in blood pressure (often shown by feeling dizzy when getting up \n\nquickly), itchy nettle-rash, wheezing, feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a rare severe \n\n\n\n73 \n\nsudden allergic reaction to this medicine. Stop injecting the product immediately and get \nmedical help at once if this occurs. \n\n\uf0b7 bleeding that is not being controlled with your usual dose of this medicine. Speak with your \ndoctor immediately if this occurs. You may have developed antibodies against factor VIII \n(inhibitors) or antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG). These make Jivi less effective at \npreventing and controlling bleeding. Your doctor may carry out tests to confirm this and ensure \nthat your Jivi dose provides adequate factor VIII levels. Your doctor may switch you back to \nyour previous factor VIII treatment, if needed. \n\n\uf0b7 previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. \n\uf0b7 heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease.  \n\uf0b7 to use a central venous access device for this medicine. You may be at risk of device-related \n\ncomplications where the catheter is inserted including: \n\uf0b7 local infections  \n\uf0b7 bacteria in the blood \n\uf0b7 a blood clot in the blood vessel \n\n \nChildren \nJivi is not for use in children younger than 12 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Jivi \nJivi is not known to influence or be influenced by other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if \nyou are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before using this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nJivi has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. \n \nJivi contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, and is therefore considered to be \nessentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. \n \n \n3. How to use Jivi \n \nTreatment with Jivi will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia A. After suitable training patients or carers may be able to give Jivi at home. \nAlways use this medicine exactly as described in this leaflet and as your doctor or pharmacist has told \nyou. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose of factor VIII units is \nmeasured in International Units (IU). \n \nTreatment of bleeding \nTo treat a bleed, your doctor will calculate and adjust your dose and how often it should be given, \ndepending on factors such as: \n\uf0b7 your weight \n\uf0b7 the severity of your haemophilia A \n\uf0b7 where the bleeding is and how serious it is \n\uf0b7 whether you have inhibitors and how high their level is \n\uf0b7 the factor VIII level that is needed. \n \n\n\n\n74 \n\nPrevention of bleeding \nTo prevent bleeding your doctor will select an appropriate dose and frequency depending on your \nneed: \n\uf0b7 45\u201360 IU per kg body weight every 5 days or \n\uf0b7 60 IU per kg body weight every 7 days or \n\uf0b7 30-40 IU per kg body weight two times per week. \n \nLaboratory tests \nLaboratory tests at suitable intervals help to ensure you always have adequate factor VIII levels. For \nmajor surgery in particular, your blood clotting must be closely monitored. \n \nDuration of treatment \nUsually Jivi treatment for haemophilia is needed lifelong. \n \nHow Jivi is given \nJivi is injected into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort level. \nThe maximum rate is 2.5 mL per minute. Jivi should be used within 3 hours after reconstitution. \n \nHow Jivi is prepared for injection \nUse only the components (vial adapter, pre-filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) \nprovided with each package of this medicine.

Now remove and discard the adapter housing (E). \n \n\n \n8. Attach the pre-filled syringe to the threaded vial adapter by turning \n\nclockwise (F). \n \n\n \n9. Inject the solvent by slowly pushing down on the plunger rod (G). \n \n\n \n10. Swirl vial gently until all material is dissolved (H). Do not shake vial. Be sure \n\nthat the powder is completely dissolved. Look to check there are no particles \nor discoloration before you use the solution. Do not use solutions containing \nvisible particles or that are cloudy. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n11. Hold the vial on end above the vial adapter and syringe (I). Fill the syringe \nby drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly. Ensure that the full content \nof the vial is drawn into the syringe. Hold the syringe upright and push the \nplunger until no air is left in the syringe. \n\n \n \n\n12. Apply a tourniquet to your arm. \n \n13. Determine the point of injection and clean the skin. \n \n14. Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster. \n \n15. Holding the vial adapter in place, remove the syringe from the vial adapter \n\n(the adapter should remain attached to the vial). Attach the syringe to the \nvenipuncture set (J). Ensure that no blood enters the syringe  \n\n \n\n \n16. Remove tourniquet. \n \n17. Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle. \n\nThe speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 2.5 mL \nper minute. \n\n \n18. If a further dose is needed, use a new syringe with product reconstituted as described above. \n \n19. If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe. Hold a pad firmly over \n\nthe injection site on your outstretched arm for about 2 minutes. Finally, apply a small pressure \ndressing to the injection site and consider if a plaster is necessary. \n\n \n20. It is recommended that every time you use Jivi, you note down the name and batch number of \n\nthe product. \n \n21. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste.
