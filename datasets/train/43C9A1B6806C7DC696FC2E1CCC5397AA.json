NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nXromi 100 mg/ml oral solution \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nOne ml of solution contains 100 mg hydroxycarbamide. \n \nExcipients with known effect \nOne ml of solution contains 0.5 mg methyl hydroxybenzoate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nOral solution. \nClear, colourless to pale yellow viscous liquid. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nXromi is indicated for the prevention of vaso-occlusive complications of Sickle Cell Disease in \npatients over 2 years of age. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nHydroxycarbamide treatment should be supervised by a physician or other healthcare professionals \nexperienced in the management of patients with Sickle Cell Disease. \n \nPosology \n \nThe posology should be based on the patient\u2019s body weight (kg). \nThe usual starting dose of hydroxycarbamide is 15 mg/kg/day and usual maintenance dose is between \n20-25 mg/kg. The maximum dose is 35 mg/kg/day. Full blood cell count with white cell differential \nand reticulocyte count should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 2 months following treatment \ninitiation.  \n \nA target absolute neutrophil count 2000-4000/\u03bcL should be aimed for, whilst maintaining platelet \ncount > 80,000/\u03bcL. If neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurs, hydroxycarbamide dosing should be \ntemporarily withheld and full blood cell count with white cell differential should be monitored weekly. \nWhen blood counts have recovered, hydroxycarbamide should be reinstated at a dose 5 mg/kg/day \nlower than the dose given before onset of cytopenias. \n \nIf dose escalation is warranted based on clinical and laboratory findings, the following steps should be \ntaken: \n\u2022 Dose to be increased by 5 mg/kg/day increments every 8 weeks \n\u2022 Increases in dose to be continued until mild myelosuppression (absolute neutrophil count \n\n2,000/\u03bcL to 4,000/\u03bcL) is achieved, up to a maximum of 35 mg/kg/day. \n\u2022 Full blood cell count with white cell differential and reticulocyte count to be monitored at least \n\nevery 4 weeks when adjusting dosage. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nOnce a maximum tolerated dose is established, laboratory safety monitoring should include full blood \ncell count with white cell differential, reticulocyte count, and platelet count every 2\u20133 months. \n \nRed blood cell (RBC), mean cell volume (MCV), and foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels should be \nmonitored for evidence of consistent or progressive laboratory response. However, a lack of increase \nin MCV, HbF, or both, is not an indication to discontinue therapy if the patient responds clinically \n(e.g. decreased incidence of pain or hospitalisation). \n \nA clinical response to treatment with hydroxycarbamide may take 3-6 months and therefore, a 6-\nmonth trial on the maximum tolerated dose is required prior to considering discontinuation due to \ntreatment failure (whether due to lack of adherence or failure to respond to therapy). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nElderly patients may be more sensitive to the myelosuppressive effects of hydroxycarbamide, and may \nrequire a lower dosage regimen. \n \nRenal impairment \nSince renal excretion is a pathway of elimination, consideration should be given to decreasing the \ndosage of hydroxycarbamide in renally impaired patients. In patients with a creatinine clearance \n(CrCl) \u2264 60 ml/min the initial hydroxycarbamide dose should be decreased by 50%. Close monitoring \nof blood parameters is advised in these patients (see section 4.4). \nHydroxycarbamide must not be administered to patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 \nml/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nThere are no data that support specific dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment. Close \nmonitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. Due to safety considerations, \nhydroxycarbamide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and \n4.4).  \n \nChildren less than 2 years of age \nThe safety and efficacy of hydroxycarbamide in children from birth up to 2 years have not yet been \nestablished. No data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nXromi is for oral use. \n \nTwo dosing syringes (a red syringe graduated to 3 ml and a white syringe graduated to 12 ml) are \nprovided for accurate measurement of the prescribed dose of the oral solution. It is recommended that \nthe healthcare professional advises the patient or carer which syringe to use to ensure that the correct \nvolume is administered.  \n \nThe smaller 3 ml syringe (red), marked from 0.5 ml to 3 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or \nequal to 3 ml. This syringe should be recommended for doses less than or equal to 3 ml (each \ngraduation of 0.1 ml contains 10 mg of hydroxycarbamide).  \nThe larger 12 ml syringe (white), marked 1 ml to 12 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 3 ml. \nThis syringe should be recommended for doses greater than 3 ml (each graduation of 0.25 ml contains \n25 mg of hydroxycarbamide). \n \nIn adults without swallowing difficulties, solid oral formulations may be more appropriate and \nconvenient. \n \nXromi may be taken with or after meals at any time of the day but patients should standardise the \nmethod of administration and time of day. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \nTo assist accurate and consistent dose delivery to the stomach water should be taken after each dose of \nXromi. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSevere hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C). \nSevere renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/min). \nToxic ranges of myelosuppression as described in section 4.2. \nBreast-feeding (see section 4.6). \nPregnancy (see section 4.6) \nConcomitant anti-retroviral medicinal products for HIV disease (see sections 4.4 and 4.5) \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nBone marrow suppression \nThe complete status of the blood, including bone marrow examination, if indicated, as well as kidney \nfunction and liver function should be determined prior to, and repeatedly during, treatment. If bone \nmarrow function is depressed, treatment with hydroxycarbamide should not be initiated.  \nContinuous follow-up of the growth of treated children and adolescents is recommended. \n \nThe full blood cell count with white cell differential, reticulate count, and platelet count should be \nmonitored regularly (see section 4.2). \nHydroxycarbamide may produce bone marrow suppression; leukopenia is generally its first and most \ncommon manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anaemia occur less often and are seldom seen without \na preceding leukopenia. Bone marrow depression is more likely in patients who have previously \nreceived radiotherapy or cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic medicinal products; hydroxycarbamide \nshould be used cautiously in such patients. The recovery from myelosuppression is rapid when \nhydroxycarbamide therapy is interrupted. \nHydroxycarbamide therapy can then be re-initiated at a lower dose (see section 4.2). \n \nSevere anaemia must be corrected with whole blood replacement before initiating therapy with \nhydroxycarbamide. If, during treatment, anaemia occurs, correct without interrupting \nhydroxycarbamide therapy. Erythrocytic abnormalities; megaloblastic erythropoiesis, which is self-\nlimiting, is often seen early in the course of hydroxycarbamide therapy. The morphologic change \nresembles pernicious anaemia, but is not related to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency. The \nmacrocytosis may mask the incidental development of folic acid deficiency; regular determinations of \nserum folic acid are recommended. Hydroxycarbamide may also delay plasma iron clearance and \nreduce the rate of iron utilisation by erythrocytes but it does not appear to alter the red blood cell \nsurvival time. \n \nOther \nPatients who have received irradiation therapy in the past may have an exacerbation of post irradiation \nerythema when hydroxycarbamide is given. \n \nRenal and hepatic impairment \nHydroxycarbamide should be used with caution in patients with marked renal dysfunction. \nHydroxycarbamide may cause hepatotoxicity and liver function tests should be monitored during \ntreatment.  \nBlood parameters for renal and hepatic impairment should be closely monitored, and \nhydroxycarbamide should be discontinued if necessary. If appropriate, hydroxycarbamide should be \nre-started at a lower dose. \n \nHIV patients \n\n\n\n5 \n\nHydroxycarbamide must not be used in combination with anti-retroviral medicinal products for HIV \ndisease and it may cause treatment failure and toxicities (in some cases fatal) in HIV patients (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.5). \n \nSecondary leukaemia and skin cancer \nIn patients receiving long-term therapy with hydroxycarbamide for myeloproliferative disorders, such \nas polycythemia, secondary leukaemia has been reported. It is unknown whether this leukaemogenic \neffect is secondary to hydroxycarbamide or associated with the patient's underlying disease. Skin \ncancer has been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxycarbamide. Patients should be \nadvised to protect skin from sun exposure. In addition patients should conduct self-inspection of the \nskin during the treatment and after discontinuation of the therapy with hydroxycarbamide and be \nscreened for secondary malignancies during routine follow-up visits. \n \nCutaneous vasculitic toxicities \nCutaneous vasculitic toxicities including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene have occurred in patients \nwith myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxycarbamide. The risk of vasculitic \ntoxicities is increased in patients who receive prior or concomitant interferon therapy. The digital \ndistribution of these vasculitic ulcerations and progressive clinical behaviour of peripheral vasculitic \ninsufficiency leading to digital infarct or gangrene were distinctly different than the typical skin ulcers \ngenerally described with Hydroxycarbamide. Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for the \ncutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in patients with myeloproliferative disease, hydroxycarbamide \nshould be discontinued if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop.  \n \nVaccinations \nConcomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the \nvaccine virus and/or may increase some of the adverse reactions of the vaccine virus because normal \ndefence mechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a \npatient taking hydroxycarbamide may result in severe infection. The patient's antibody response to \nvaccines may be decreased. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment and for at \nleast six months after treatment has finished and individual specialist advice sought (see section 4.5). \n \nLeg ulcers \nIn patients with leg ulcers, hydroxycarbamide should be used with caution. Leg ulcers are a common \ncomplication of Sickle Cell Disease, but have also been reported in patients treated with \nhydroxycarbamide. \n \nCarcinogenicity \nHydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic in a wide range of test systems. Hydroxycarbamide is \npresumed to be a transspecies carcinogen (see section 5.3).  \n \nSafe handling of the solution  \nParents and care givers should avoid hydroxycarbamide contact with skin or mucous membrane. If the \nsolution comes into contact with skin or mucosa, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly \nwith soap and water (see section 6.6). \n \nExcipients  \nThis medicinal product contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218) which may cause allergic \nreactions (possibly delayed). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe myelosuppressive activity may be potentiated by previous or concomitant radiotherapy or \ncytotoxic therapy.  \nConcurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosuppressive medicinal products or radiation \ntherapy may increase bone marrow depression, gastro-intestinal disturbances or mucositis. An \nerythema caused by radiation therapy may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nPatients must not be treated with hydroxycarbamide and anti-retroviral medicinal products \nconcurrently (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  \nFatal and non-fatal pancreatitis has occurred in HIV-infected patients during therapy with \nhydroxycarbamide and didanosine, with or without stavudine.  \nHepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during post-marketing surveillance \nin HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxycarbamide and other antiretroviral medicinal products. \nFatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of \nhydroxycarbamide, didanosine, and stavudine.   \nPeripheral neuropathy, which was severe in some cases, has been reported in HIV-infected patients \nreceiving hydroxycarbamide in combination with anti-retroviral medicinal products, including \ndidanosine, with or without stavudine (see section 4.4).  \n \nPatients treated with hydroxycarbamide in combination with didanosine, stavudine, and indinavir \nshowed a median decline in CD4 cells of approximately 100/mm3. \n \nStudies have shown that there is an analytical interference of hydroxycarbamide with the enzymes \n(urease, uricase, and lactic dehydrogenase) used in the determination of urea, uric acid, and lactic acid, \nrendering falsely elevated results of these in patients treated with hydroxycarbamide. \n \nVaccinations \nThere is an increased risk of severe or fatal infections with the concomitant use of live vaccines. Live \nvaccines are not recommended in immunosuppressed patients. \nConcomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the \nvaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine virus, because normal defence \nmechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide therapy. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a \npatient taking hydroxycarbamide may result in severe infections. Generally, the patient's antibody \nresponse to vaccines may be decreased. Treatment with hydroxycarbamide and concomitant \nimmunisation with live virus vaccines should only be performed if benefits clearly outweigh potential \nrisks (see section 4.4). \n \nCutaneous vasculitic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have occurred in \npatients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxycarbamide. These vasculitic \ntoxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or currently receiving, interferon \ntherapy (see section 4.4).  \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females \nMedicinal products which affect DNA synthesis, such as hydroxycarbamide, may be potent mutagenic \nactive substances. This possibility should be carefully considered before administering this medicinal \nproduct to male or female patients who may contemplate conception.  \nBoth male and female patients should be advised to use contraceptive measures before and during \ntreatment with hydroxycarbamide. \n \nPregnancy \nStudies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients on hydroxycarbamide \nshould be made aware of the theoretical risks to the foetus. \n \nHydroxycarbamide can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Therefore it must \nnot be administered to patients who are pregnant. \nPatients on hydroxycarbamide wishing to conceive should stop treatment 3 to 6 months before \npregnancy if possible.  \nThe patient should be instructed to immediately contact a doctor in case of suspected pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n\n\n\n7 \n\nHydroxycarbamide is excreted in human breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in breast-feeding infants, breast-feeding must be discontinued while taking \nhydroxycarbamide.  \n \nFertility \nFertility in males might be affected by treatment. Very common reversible oligo- and azoo-spermia \nhave been observed in man, although these disorders are also associated with the underlying disease. \nImpaired fertility has been observed in male rats (see section 5.3). \nMale patients should be informed by their healthcare professionals about the possibility of sperm \nconservation (cryopreservation) before the start of therapy. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nHydroxycarbamide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be \nadvised not to drive or operate machines, if dizziness is experienced while taking hydroxycarbamide. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nBone-marrow suppression is the major toxic effect of hydroxycarbamide and is dose related. At lower \ndoses, mild, transient and reversible cytopenias are commonly reported in Sickle Cell Disease patients \nwhich is expected based on the pharmacology of hydroxycarbamide.   \nHydroxycarbamide affects spermatogenesis, and hence oligospermia and azoospermia are very \ncommonly reported.  \nOther commonly reported adverse effects also include nausea, constipation, headache, and dizziness. \nAdverse reactions affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissue such as darkening of the skin nail beds, \ndry skin, skin ulcers, and alopecia tend to occur following several years of long-term daily \nmaintenance therapy. Rarely leg ulcers and very rarely systemic lupus erythematosus have been \nreported.  \nThere is also a serious risk of leukaemia and in the elderly, skin cancer, although the frequency is not \nknown. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nThe list is presented by system organ class, MedDRA preferred term, and frequency using the \nfollowing frequency categories: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100, < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 \n1/1,000, < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000, < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be \nestimated from the available data).  \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 1: Adverse reactions \n \n\nSystem organ class Frequency Adverse reaction \nInfections and infestations Unknown Parvovirus B19 infection \n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant \nand unspecified (including \ncysts and polyps) \n\nUnknown Leukaemia, skin cancers (in elderly patients) \n\nBlood and lymphatic system \ndisorders \n\nVery common \n\nBone marrow depression \nincluding neutropenia, \nreticulocytopenia, \nmacrocytosis \n\nCommon Thrombocytopenia, anaemia  \nMetabolism and nutrition \ndisorders Unknown \n\nWeight gain, vitamin D \ndeficiency \n\nNervous system disorders Common Headache, dizziness \n\nVascular disorders Unknown Bleeding \n\nGastrointestinal disorders \n\nCommon \n Nausea, constipation \n\nUncommon Stomatitis, diarrhoea, vomiting  \n\nUnknown \nGastrointestinal disturbances, \ngastrointestinal ulcer, severe \nhypomagnesaemia \n\nHepatobiliary disorders Uncommon Elevated liver enzymes, Hepatotoxicity \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue \ndisorders \n\nCommon \nSkin ulcer, oral, nail and skin \nhyperpigmentation, dry skin, \nalopecia \n\nUncommon  Rash \nRare Leg ulcers \n\nVery Rare Systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematosus  \n\nReproductive system and \nbreast disorders \n\nVery common Oligospermia, azoospermia \n\nUnknown Amenorrhea \nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions Unknown Fever \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nIn the event of bone marrow suppression, haematological recovery usually occurs within two weeks of \nwithdrawal of hydroxycarbamide. Gradual dose titration is recommended to avoid more severe bone \nmarrow suppressions (see section 4.2). \nThe macrocytosis caused by hydroxycarbamide is not vitamin B12 or folic acid dependent. The \nanaemia commonly observed has mainly been due to an infection with Parvovirus or a splenic \nsequestration. \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\nWeight gain observed during treatment with hydroxycarbamide may be an effect of improved general \nconditions. \n \nOligospermia and azoospermia caused by hydroxycarbamide are in general reversible, but have to be \ntaken into account when fatherhood is desired (see section 5.3). These disorders are also associated \nwith the underlying disease. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \nAcute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxycarbamide at a dosage \nseveral times greater than that recommended. Soreness, violet erythema, oedema on palms and foot \nsoles followed by scaling of hands and feet, intense generalised hyperpigmentation of skin, and severe \nacute stomatitis were observed. \nIn patients with Sickle Cell Disease, neutropenia was reported in isolated cases of hydroxycarbamide \noverdose (1.43 times and 8.57 times of the maximum recommended dose of 35 mg/kg body weight/ \nday).  \n \nTreatment \nImmediate treatment consists of gastric lavage, followed by supportive therapy for the \ncardiorespiratory systems if required. Patients should be monitored for vital signs, blood and urine \nchemistry, renal and hepatic function and full blood counts for at least 3 weeks. Longer periods of \nmonitoring may be required. If necessary, blood should be transfused.  \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: L01XX05. \n \nMechanism of action \nHydroxycarbamide is an orally active antineoplastic agent.  \nAlthough the mechanism of action has not yet been clearly defined, hydroxycarbamide appears to act \nby interfering with synthesis of DNA by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without \ninterfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or protein. \n \nOne of the mechanisms by which hydroxycarbamide acts is the elevation of HbF concentrations in \nSickle Cell Disease patients. HbF interferes with the polymerisation of HbS (sickle haemoglobin) and \nthus impedes the sickling of red blood cell. In all clinical studies, there was a significant increase in \nHbF from baseline after hydroxycarbamide use. \nRecently, hydroxycarbamide has shown to be associated with the generation of nitric oxide suggesting \nthat nitric oxide stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphatase (cGMP) production, which then \nactivates a protein kinase and increases the production of HbF. Other known pharmacological effects \nof hydroxycarbamide which may contribute to its beneficial effects in Sickle Cell Disease include \ndecrease of neutrophils, improved deformability of sickled cells, and altered adhesion of red blood \ncells to the endothelium. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n10 \n\nEvidence for the efficacy of hydroxycarbamide in reducing the vaso-occlusive complications of Sickle \nCell Disease in patients older than 2 years comes from four randomised controlled trials (Charache et \nal 1995 [MSH Study]; Jain et al 2012, Ferster et al 1996; Ware et al 2015 [TWiTCH]). Furthermore, \nfindings from these pivotal studies are supported by observational studies including some long-term \nfollow up. \n \nMulti-centre study of hydroxycarbamide in Sickle Cell Anaemia (MSH)  \nThe MSH study was a multicentre, randomised, and double-blind study, which compared \nhydroxycarbamide with placebo in adults with Sickle Cell Anaemia (HbSS genotype only) with the \nobjective of reducing the frequency of pain crises. A total of 299 participants were randomised; 152 to \nhydroxycarbamide and 147 to matching placebo. Hydroxycarbamide was started at low dose  \n(15 mg/kg per day) and increased at 12- weekly intervals by 5 mg/kg per day until mild bone marrow \ndepression was achieved, as judged by either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Once the blood count \nhad recovered, treatment was restarted at 2.5 mg/kg per day less than the toxic dose. \nThere was a statistically significant difference between the hydroxycarbamide group and placebo \ngroup in the mean annual crisis rate (all crises), mean difference -2.80 (95% CI -4.74 to -0.86)  \n(p = 0.005), and for crises requiring hospitalisation, mean difference -1.50 (95% CI -2.58 to -0.42)  \n(p = 0.007).  \nThe study also showed an increase in median time from the initiation of treatment to first painful crisis \n(2.76 months in the hydroxycarbamide arm compared with 1.35 months on placebo (p = 0.014), \nsecond painful crisis (6.58 months in the hydroxycarbamide group compared with 4.13 months on \nplacebo (p < 0.0024), and third painful crisis (11.9 months in the hydroxycarbamide group compared \nwith 7.04 months on placebo (p = 0.0002). \nAlso rates of acute chest syndrome were decreased in those taking hydroxycarbamide when compared \nwith those taking placebo; RR 0.44 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.68) (p < 0.001). Similar decreases were seen in \nblood transfusion rates, a surrogate for life-threatening illness. Hydroxycarbamide did not reduce rates \nof hepatic or splenic sequestration when compared with placebo.  \n \nIn keeping with the mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide, the MSH study also showed a \nstatistically significant increase in HbF (mean difference 3.9% (95% CI 2.69 to 5.11 (p < 0.0001)) and \nhaemoglobin levels (mean difference 0.6 g/dL (95% CI 0.28 to 0.92, p < 0.0014) and a decrease in \nhaemolytic markers in the groups treated with hydroxycarbamide. The MSH study showed increased \nhaematological toxicity resulting in a dose reduction in the hydroxycarbamide group as compared with \nplacebo, but there were no infections related to neutropenia or bleeding episodes due to \nthrombocytopenia. \n \nPaediatric Population \n \nCross-over comparison with placebo (Ferster et al 1996) \nA randomized cross-over study was conducted in 25 children and young adults (age range: 2 to 22 \nyears) with homozygous sickle cell anaemia and severe clinical manifestations (defined as >3 vaso-\nocclusive crises in the year before study entry and/or with previous history of stroke, acute chest \nsyndrome, recurrent crises without a free interval, or splenic sequestration). The primary outcome \nmeasure of the study was the number and duration of hospitalisations. Patients were randomly \nassigned to receive either hydroxycarbamide first for 6 months, followed by placebo for 6 months, or \nplacebo first, followed by hydroxycarbamide for 6 months. Hydroxycarbamide was administered at an \ninitial dose of 20 mg/kg/day. The dose was increased to 25 mg/kg per day if change in HbF was <2% \nafter 2 months. Dose was reduced by 50% for bone marrow toxicity.  \nThe study reported 16 patients out of 22 (73%) did not require any hospitalisation for painful episodes \nwhen treated with hydroxycarbamide as compared with only 3 of 22 (14%) when treated with placebo. \nIn addition, there was a reduction in mean hospital stay; 5.3 days in the hydroxycarbamide group and \n15.2 days in the placebo group. There were no deaths reported in the study. An increase in HbF and a \ndecrease in absolute neutrophil count were reported in the hydroxycarbamide group. Similarly after six \nmonths of treatment, haemoglobin and MCV increased significantly whilst platelet count and white \nblood cells (WBC) decreased significantly in the hydroxycarbamide group. Results of this study are \npresented in Tables 2 and 3 below. \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 2: Number of Hospitalisations and Number of Days in Hospital by Treatment (Both Periods \nCombined)(Ferster et al, 1996) \n \n\n Hydroxycarbamide \n(n=22) \n\nPlacebo \n(n=22) \n\nNumber of \nhospitalisations \n\n  \n\n0 16 3 \n\n1 2 13 \n\n2 3 2 \n\n3 0 3 \n\n4 1 0 \n\n5 0 1 \n\nNumber of days in \nhospital \n\n  \n\n0 16 3 \n\n1 \u2013 10 2 13 \n\n>10 4 6 \n\nRange 0-19 0-104 \n\n \nTable 3: Mean Haematologic Values Before and After 6 Months of Treatment with hydroxycarbamide \n(Ferster et al, 1996) \n \n Before \n\nHydroxycarbamide \nTherapy \n(mean \u00b1 SD) \n\nAfter \nHydroxycarbamide \nTherapy \n(mean \u00b1 SD) \n\n \nP value \n\nHaemoglobin (Hb) \n(g/dL) \n\n8.1 \u00b1 0.75 8.5 \u00b1 0.83 Not significant  \n\nMCV (fL) 85.2 \u00b1 9.74 95.5 \u00b1 11.57 <0.001 \nMean corpuscular \nhaemoglobin \nconcentration \n(MCHC) (%) \n\n33.0 \u00b1 2.08 32.3 \u00b1 1.12 Not significant \n\nPlatelets (\u00d7109/L) 443.2 \u00b1 189.1 386.7 \u00b1 144.6 Not significant \nWBC (\u00d7109/L) 12.47 \u00b1 4.58 8.9 \u00b1 2.51 <0.001 \nHbF (%) 4.65 \u00b1 4.81 15.34 \u00b1 11.3 <0.001 \nReticulocytes (%) 148.6 \u00b1 53.8 102.7 \u00b1 48.5 <0.001 \n \nLow fixed dose hydroxycarbamide in children with Sickle Cell Disease (Jain et al 2012) \nIn a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study conducted in a tertiary hospital in India,   \n60 children (aged 5-18 years) with three or more blood transfusions or vaso-occlusive crises requiring \nhospitalisation per year, were randomised to fixed dose 10 mg/mg per day hydroxycarbamide (n=30) \nor to a matched placebo (n=30). The primary outcome was the decrease in the frequency of vaso-\nocclusive crises per patient per year. Secondary outcomes included the decrease in frequency of blood \ntransfusions and hospitalizations, and increase in HbF levels. \n \nAfter 18 months of treatment, there was a significant difference in the number of vaso-occlusive crises \nbetween the hydroxycarbamide group and placebo group, mean difference  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n-9.60 (95% CI -10.86 to -8.34) (p < 0.00001). There was also significant difference between the \nhydroxycarbamide group and placebo groups in the number of blood transfusions, mean difference  \n-1.85 (95% CI -2.18 to -1.52) (p < 0.00001), in the number of hospitalisations, mean difference  \n-8.89 (95% CI -10.04 to -7.74) (p < 0.00001), and the duration of hospitalisation, mean difference  \n-4.00 days (95% CI -4.87 to -3.13) (p < 0.00001). Results are presented in Table 4. \n \nThe study also showed a statistically significant increase in HbF and Hb levels and a decrease in \nhaemolytic markers in the groups treated with hydroxycarbamide. \n \nTable 4: Comparison of the Number of Clinical Events before and after Intervention in the \nHydroxycarbamide and Placebo Groups \n \n\n Hydroxycarbamide Placebo   \n\nNumber of events / \npatient/ year Before \n\nAfter 18 \nmonths Before \n\nAfter 18 \nmonths \n\nP \nvalue1 P value\n\n2 \n\nVaso-occlusive crises 12.13 \u00b1 8.56 0.6 \u00b1 1.37 11.46 \u00b1 3.01 10.2 \u00b1 3.24 0.10 <0.001 \nBlood transfusions 2.43 \u00b1 0.69 0.13 \u00b1 0.43 2.13 \u00b1 0.98 1.98 \u00b1 0.82 0.25 <0.001 \n\nHospitalisations 10.13 \u00b1 6.56 0.70 \u00b1 1.28 9.56 \u00b1 2.91 9.59 \u00b1 2.94  <0.001 \n1.

The primary objective of this study was to examine if \nhydroxycarbamide could maintain TCD velocities after an initial period of transfusions as effectively \nas chronic blood transfusions. \nSubjects assigned to standard treatment (n = 61) continued to receive monthly blood transfusions to \nmaintain 30% HbS or lower, while those assigned to the alternative treatment (n = 60), after having \nreceived blood transfusions for a mean duration of 4.5 years (\u00b12.8), started oral hydroxycarbamide at \n20 mg/kg/day, which was escalated to each participant\u2019s maximum tolerated dose. This study used a \nnon-inferiority trial design with a primary endpoint of TCD velocity at 24 months, controlling for \nbaseline (enrollment) values. The non-inferiority margin was 15 cm/s. At the first scheduled interim \nanalysis, non-inferiority was shown and the sponsor terminated the study. Final model-based TCD \nvelocities were 143 cm/s (95% CI 140-146) in children who received standard transfusions and 138 \ncm/s (95% CI 135-142) in those who received hydroxycarbamide, with a difference of 4.54 cm/s (95% \nCI 0.10-8.98). Non-inferiority (p = 8.82\u00d710-16) and post-hoc superiority (p = 0.023) were met. There \nwas no difference in life-threatening neurological events between the treatment groups. Iron overload \nimproved more in the hydroxycarbamide than the transfusion arm, with a greater average change in \nserum ferritin (\u20131805 versus \u201338 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) and liver iron concentration (average = \u20131.9 \nmg/g versus +2.4 mg/g dry weight liver; p = 0.0011). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAbsorption \nAfter oral administration hydroxycarbamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak \nplasma concentrations are reached within 2 hours and by 24 hours the serum concentrations are \nvirtually zero. Bioavailability is complete or nearly complete in cancer patients.  \n \nIn a comparative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers (n=28), 500 mg of \nhydroxycarbamide oral solution was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference 500 mg \ncapsule, with respect to both the peak concentration and area under the curve. There was a statistically \n\n\n\n13 \n\nsignificant reduction in time to peak concentration with hydroxycarbamide oral solution compared to \nthe reference 500 mg capsule (0.5 versus 0.75 hours, p = 0.0467), indicating a faster rate of absorption. \n \nIn a study of children with Sickle Cell Disease, liquid and capsule formulations resulted in similar area \nunder the curve, peak concentrations, and half-life. The largest difference in the pharmacokinetic \nprofile was a trend towards a shorter time to peak concentration following ingestion of the liquid \ncompared with the capsule, but that difference did not reach statistical significance (0.74 versus 0.97 \nhours, p = 0.14). \n \nDistribution \nHydroxycarbamide distributes rapidly throughout the human body, enters the cerebrospinal fluid, \nappears in peritoneal fluid and ascites, and concentrates in leukocytes and erythrocytes. The estimated \nvolume of distribution of hydroxycarbamide approximates total body water. The volume of \ndistribution following oral dosing of hydroxycarbamide is approximately equal to total body water: \nadult values of 0.48 \u2013 0.90 L/kg have been reported, whilst in children a population estimate of 0.7 \nL/kg has been reported. The extent of protein binding of hydroxycarbamide is unknown. \n \nBiotransformation \nIt appears that nitroxyl, the corresponding carboxylic acid and nitric oxide are metabolites: Urea has \nalso been shown to be a metabolite of hydroxycarbamide. Hydroxycarbamide at 30, 100 and 300 \u00b5M \nis not metabolised in vitro by cytochrome P450s of human liver microsomes. At concentrations \nranging from 10 to 300 \u00b5M, hydroxycarbamide does not stimulate the in vitro ATPase activity of \nrecombinant human P glycoprotein (P-gp), indicating that hydroxycarbamide is not a P-gp substrate. \nHence, no interaction is to be expected in case of concomitant administration with substances being \nsubstrates of cytochromes P450 or P-gp. \n \nElimination \nThe total body clearance of hydroxycarbamide in adult patients with Sickle Cell Disease is 0.17L/h/kg. \nThe respective value in children was  similar, 0.22 L/h/kg. \nA significant fraction of hydroxycarbamide is eliminated by nonrenal (mainly hepatic) mechanisms. In \nadults, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is reported to be approximately 37% of the oral dose \nwhen renal function is normal. In children, the fraction of hydroxycarbamide excreted unchanged into \nthe urine comprised about 50%. \nIn adult cancer patients, hydroxycarbamide was eliminated with a half-life of approximately 2-3 hours. \nIn a single dose study in children with Sickle Cell Disease, the mean half-life was reported to be 1.7 \nhours.  \n \nElderly \nAlthough there is no evidence of an age effect on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship, \nelderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of hydroxycarbamide and therefore consideration \nshould be given to starting with a lower initial dose and more cautious dose escalation. Close \nmonitoring of blood parameters is advised (see section 4.2). \n \nRenal impairment \nAs renal excretion is a pathway of elimination, consideration should be given to decreasing the dose of \nhydroxycarbamide in patients with renal impairment. In an open single-dose study in adult patients \nwith Sickle Cell Disease the influence of renal function on pharmacokinetics of hydroxycarbamide \nwas assessed. Patients with normal (CrCl> 90 ml/min), mild (CrCl 60-89 ml/min), moderate (CrCl 30-\n59 ml/min), severe (CrCl 15-29 ml/min) renal impairment, and End Stage Renal Disease (CrCL < 15 \nml/min) received hydroxycarbamide as a single dose of 15 mg/kg body weight. In patients, whose \nCrCl was below 60 ml/min or patients with End Stage Renal Disease the mean exposure to \nhydroxycarbamide was approximately 64% higher than in patients with normal renal function. \nIt is recommended that the starting dose is reduced by 50% in patients with CrCl <60 ml/min (see \nsections 4.2 and 4.3). \nClose monitoring of blood parameters is advised in these patients. \n \n \n\n\n\n14 \n\nHepatic impairment \nThere are no data that support specific guidance for dose adjustment in patients with hepatic \nimpairment, but, due to safety considerations, hydroxycarbamide is contraindicated in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Close monitoring of blood parameters is advised in \npatients with hepatic impairment. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical toxicity studies have demonstrated the most commonly observed effects include bone \nmarrow depression in rats, dogs and monkeys. In some species cardiovascular and haematological \neffects have also been observed. Observations in monkeys have also shown lymphoid atrophy and \ndegeneration of the small and large intestine. Toxicology studies have also demonstrated testicular \natrophy with decreased spermatogenesis and sperm count in rats and decreased testis weight and \nreduced sperm counts in mice as well. While in dogs reversible spermatogenic arrest was noted. \n \nHydroxycarbamide is unequivocally genotoxic and although conventional long-term carcinogenicity \nstudies have not been conducted, hydroxycarbamide is presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen \nwhich implies a carcinogenic risk to humans. \n \nHydroxycarbamide crosses the placental barrier, demonstrated by dams exposed to hydroxycarbamide \nduring gestation. Embryotoxicity manifesting as decreased foetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, \nand developmental delays has been reported in species including mice, hamsters, cats, dogs, and \nmonkeys at doses comparable to human doses. Teratogenic effects manifested as partially ossified \ncranial bones, absence of eye sockets, hydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, and missing lumbar \nvertebrae. \n \nHydroxycarbamide administered to male rats at 60 mg/kg body weight/day (about double the \nrecommended usual maximum dose in humans) produced testicular atrophy, decreased \nspermatogenesis and significantly reduced their ability to impregnate females. \n \nOverall, exposure to hydroxycarbamide produces abnormalities in several experimental animal species \nand affects the reproductive capacity of male and female animals.  \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nXromi 100 mg/ml oral solution \nhydroxycarbamide \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in \n\nthis leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet: \n \n1. What Xromi is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you take Xromi \n3. How to take Xromi \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Xromi \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Xromi is and what it is used for \n \nXromi contains hydroxycarbamide, a substance which reduces the growth and multiplication of some \ncells in the bone marrow. These effects lead to a reduction of circulating red, white and coagulation \nblood cells. In Sickle Cell Disease, hydroxycarbamide also helps to prevent red blood cells from \ntaking the abnormal sickle shape.   \nSickle Cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects the disc shaped red cells of the blood. \nSome cells become abnormal, rigid and take a crescent or sickle shape which leads to anaemia. \nThe sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause acute pain crises \nand organ damage.  \n \nXromi is used to prevent the complications of blocked blood vessels caused by Sickle Cell Disease in \npatients over 2 years of age. Xromi will decrease the number of painful crises as well as the need for \nhospitalisation as a result of the disease. \n \n \n2.

How to take Xromi \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. \n \nXromi should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood \nproblems.  \n \n- When you take Xromi your doctor will take regular blood tests. This is to check the number and \n\ntype of cells in your blood and to check your liver and kidney. \n- Depending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed initially every two weeks and then \n\nevery 2-3 months. \n- Depending on these results your doctor may change your dose of Xromi.  \n \nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual starting dose for adults, \nadolescents and children over the age of 2 years is 15 mg/kg each day and the usual maintenance dose \nis between 20-25 mg/kg. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. Sometimes the doctor \nmay change your dose of Xromi, for example as a result of different tests. If you are not sure how \nmuch medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. \n \nXromi with food and drink \nYou can take this medicine with or after meals at any time of the day. However, the choice of method \nand time of day should be consistent from day to day.  \n \nUse in elderly \nYou may be more sensitive to the effects of Xromi and your doctor may need to give you a lower \ndose. \n \nIf you have kidney disease \nYour doctor may need to give you a lower dose. \nYou should not take Xromi if you have severe kidney disease. \n \nHandling  \n \nYour pack of Xromi contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes (a \nred 3 ml syringe and a white 12 ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your medicine.  \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n \nIt is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist \nwill advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed.  \n \nThe smaller 3 ml syringe (red), marked from 0.5 ml to 3 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or \nequal to 3 ml. You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 3 ml \n(each graduation of 0.1 ml contains 10 mg of hydroxycarbamide).  \nThe larger 12 ml syringe (white), marked 1 ml to 12 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 3 ml. \nYou should use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 3 ml (each graduation of \n0.25 ml contains 25 mg of hydroxycarbamide). \n \nIf you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after \nadministering a dose. Wipe up spillages immediately. To decrease the risk of exposure disposable \ngloves should be used when handling Xromi. To minimise air bubbles, do not shake the bottle before \nadministering a dose. \n \nIf Xromi comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly \nwith soap and water. \n \nWhen you use the medicine follow the instructions below: \n\n \n \n1. Put on disposable hand gloves before handling Xromi. \n2. Remove the bottle cap (figure 1) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave in \nplace for future doses (figure 2).  \n3. Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 3). Your doctor or \npharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 3 ml (red syringe) or the 12 ml \n(white syringe) in order to give the correct dose.  \n4. Turn the bottle upside down (figure 4).  \n\n\n\n32 \n\n5. Pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the syringe. \nPull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed (figure 4). If \nyou are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask your doctor or nurse \nfor advice.  \n6. Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, holding it \nby the barrel rather than the plunger.  \n7. Gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek.  \n8. Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your cheek \nand swallow it. DO NOT forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the back of your \nmouth or throat, as you may choke.  \n9. Remove the syringe from your mouth.  \n10. Swallow the dose of oral solution then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in your \nmouth. \n11. Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place.  Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. \n12. Wash the syringe with cold or warm tap water and rinse well. Hold the syringe under water and \nmove the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. Let the \nsyringe dry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. Store the syringe in a hygienic \nplace with the medicine. \n \nRepeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.  \n \nIf you take more Xromi than you should \nIf you take more Xromi than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately.

sickle shape which leads to anaemia. the sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. this can cause acute pain crises and organ damage. xromi is used to prevent the complications of blocked blood vessels caused by sickle cell disease in patients over 2 years of age. xromi will decrease the number of painful crises as well as the need for hospitalisation as a

or pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. xromi should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood problems. - when you take xromi your doctor will take regular blood tests. this is to check the number and type of cells in your blood and to check your liver and kidney. - depending on the dose you take, these tests may be performed initially every two weeks and then every 2-3 months. - depending on these results your doctor may change your dose of xromi. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. the usual starting dose for adults, adolescents and children over the age of 2 years is 15 mg/kg each day and the usual maintenance dose is between 20-25 mg/kg. your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. sometimes the doctor may change your dose of xromi, for example as a result of different tests. if you are not sure how much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. xromi with food and drink you can take this medicine with or after meals at any time of the day. however, the choice of method and time of day should be consistent from day to day. use in elderly you may be more sensitive to the effects of xromi and your doctor may need to give you a lower dose. if you have kidney disease your doctor may need to give you a lower dose. you should not take xromi if you have severe kidney disease. handling your pack of xromi contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes (a red 3 ml syringe and a white 12 ml syringe). always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. it is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. your doctor or pharmacist will advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed. the smaller 3 ml syringe (red), marked from 0.5 ml to 3 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or equal to 3 ml. you should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 3 ml (each graduation of 0.1 ml contains 10 mg of hydroxycarbamide). the larger 12 ml syringe (white), marked 1 ml to 12 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 3 ml. you should use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 3 ml (each graduation of 0.25 ml contains 25 mg of hydroxycarbamide). if you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after administering a dose. wipe up spillages immediately. to decrease the risk of exposure disposable gloves should be used when handling xromi. to minimise air bubbles, do not shake the bottle before administering a dose. if xromi comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. when you use the medicine follow the instructions below: 1. put on disposable hand gloves before handling xromi. 2. remove the bottle cap (figure 1) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave in place for future doses (figure 2). 3. push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 3). your doctor or pharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 3 ml (red syringe) or the 12 ml (white syringe) in order to give the correct dose. 4. turn the bottle upside down (figure 4). 5. pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the syringe. pull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed (figure 4). if you are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask your doctor or nurse for advice. 6. turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, holding it by the barrel rather than the plunger. 7. gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek. 8. slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your cheek and swallow it. do not forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the back of your mouth or throat, as you may choke. 9. remove the syringe from your mouth. 10. swallow the dose of oral solution then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in your mouth. 11. put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place. ensure that the cap is tightly closed. 12. wash the syringe with cold or warm tap water and rinse well. hold the syringe under water and move the plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. let the syringe dry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. store the syringe in a hygienic place with the medicine. repeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist. if you take more xromi than you should if you take more xromi than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately. take the medicine pack and this leaflet with you. the most common symptoms of overdose with xromi are: - redness of the skin, - soreness (touch is painful) and swelling of the palms of hands and soles of feet followed by the hands and feet becoming scaly, - skin becoming strongly pigmented (locally changes of colour), - soreness or swelling in the mouth. if you forget to take xromi tell your doctor. do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop taking xromi do not stop taking your medicine unless advised by your doctor. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "xromi", "Type":
