This will allow quick identification of \nnew safety information.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.  \nSee section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.  \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nYescarta 0.4 \u2013 2 x 108 cells dispersion for infusion \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n2.1 General description \n \nYescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell \nimmunotherapy.  To prepare Yescarta, patient\u2019s own T cells are harvested and genetically modified ex \nvivo by retroviral transduction to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprising a murine \nanti-CD19 single chain variable fragment linked to CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta \nsignalling domain.  The anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells are expanded and infused back into \nthe patient, where they can recognise and eliminate CD19-expressing target cells. \n \n2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition  \n \nEach patient specific single infusion bag of Yescarta contains a dispersion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells \nin approximately 68 mL for a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body \nweight (range: 1 x 106 \u2013 2 x 106 cells/kg), with a maximum of 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells. \n \nExcipients with known effect \n \nEach bag of Yescarta contains 300 mg sodium. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nDispersion for infusion. \n \nA clear to opaque, white to red dispersion. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nYescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell \nlymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more \nlines of systemic therapy.  \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nYescarta must be administered in a qualified clinical setting. \n \nYescarta therapy should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by a healthcare professional \nexperienced in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for administration and \nmanagement of patients treated with Yescarta. At least 1 dose of tocilizumab for use in the event of \ncytokine release syndrome (CRS) and emergency equipment must be available prior to infusion. The \n\n\n\n3 \n\ntreatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous \ndose. \n \nPosology \n \nYescarta is intended for autologous use only (see section 4.4). \n \nA single dose of Yescarta contains 2 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg of body weight (or \nmaximum of 2 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately \n68 mL dispersion in an infusion bag. \n \nThe availability of Yescarta must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting regimen. \n \nPre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy) \n\u2022 A lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 \n\nintravenous and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 intravenous should be administered on the 5th, 4th, and 3rd \nday before infusion of Yescarta. \n\n \nPre-medication \n\u2022 Paracetamol 500-1,000 mg given orally and diphenhydramine 12.5 to 25 mg intravenous or oral \n\n(or equivalent) approximately 1 hour before Yescarta infusion is recommended. \n\u2022 Prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended as it may interfere with the \n\nactivity of Yescarta. \n \nMonitoring \n\u2022 Patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and \n\nsymptoms of potential CRS, neurologic events and other toxicities.  Physicians should consider \nhospitalisation for the first 10 days post infusion or at the first signs or symptoms of CRS and/or \nneurologic events. \n\n\u2022 After the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician\u2019s \ndiscretion. \n\n\u2022 Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at \nleast 4 weeks following infusion. \n\n \nSpecial populations \n \nPatients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus \n(HCV) infection \nThere is no clinical experience in patients with active HIV, HBV or HCV infection. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Yescarta in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet \nbeen established.  No data are available. \n \nElderly \nNo dose adjustment is required in patients \u2265 65 years of age.  Efficacy was consistent with the overall \ntreated patient population. \n \nMethod of administration \n \nYescarta is to be administered via intravenous infusion. \n \nYescarta must not be irradiated.  Do NOT use a leukodepleting filter. \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product \nThis medicinal product contains genetically modified human blood cells.  Healthcare professionals \nhandling Yescarta should take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential \ntransmission of infectious diseases. \n \nPreparation of Yescarta \n\u2022 Verify that the patient\u2019s identity (ID) matches the patient identifiers on the Yescarta cassette.  \n\u2022 The Yescarta bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the patient-\n\nspecific label does not match the intended patient.  \n\u2022 Once the patient ID is confirmed, remove the Yescarta bag from the cassette. \n\u2022 Check that the patient information on the cassette label matches that on the bag label. \n\u2022 Inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing.  If the bag is \n\ncompromised, follow the local guidelines (or immediately contact Kite). \n\u2022 Place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag or per local guidelines. \n\u2022 Thaw Yescarta at approximately 37 \u00b0C using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there \n\nis no visible ice in the infusion bag.  Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of \ncellular material.  If visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag.  \nSmall clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing.  Yescarta should \nnot be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to infusion.  Thawing \nshould take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. \n\n\u2022 Once thawed, Yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 \u00b0C-25 \u00b0C) for up to 3 hours. \n \nAdministration \n\u2022 For autologous use only. \n\u2022 Tocilizumab and emergency equipment should be available prior to infusion and during the \n\nmonitoring period. \n\u2022 A leukodepleting filter must not be used. \n\u2022 Central venous access is recommended for the administration of Yescarta. \n\u2022 Verify the patient ID again to match the patient identifiers on the Yescarta bag. \n\u2022 Prime the tubing with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per mL) prior to \n\ninfusion. \n\u2022 Infuse the entire content of the Yescarta bag within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic \n\npump.  Yescarta is stable at room temperature for up to 3 hours after thaw. \n\u2022 Gently agitate the bag during Yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. \n\u2022 After the entire content of the bag is infused, rinse the tubing at the same infusion rate with \n\n0.9% sodium chloride solution (0.154 mmol sodium per mL) to ensure all Yescarta is delivered. \n \nFor special precautions for disposal, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \nContraindications of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy must be considered. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \n \nTo ensure traceability the name of the product, the batch number and the name of the treated patient \nshould be kept for a period of 30 years. \n \nGeneral \n \nDue to the risks associated with Yescarta treatment, infusion should be delayed if a patient has any of \nthe following conditions: \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\u2022 Unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions, or \nhypotension) including from preceding chemotherapies. \n\n\u2022 Active uncontrolled infection. \n\u2022 Active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). \n \nPatients treated with Yescarta should not donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantation. \n \nYescarta is intended solely for autologous use and must not be administered to other patients.  Before \ninfusion, the patient\u2019s identity must match the patient identifiers on the Yescarta infusion bag and \ncassette.  Do not infuse Yescarta if the information on the patient-specific label does not match the \nintended patient. \n \nConcomitant disease \n \nPatients with active CNS disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiac function are \nlikely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described below and require \nspecial attention. \n \nPrimary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma \n \nThere is no experience of use of Yescarta in patients with primary CNS lymphoma.  Therefore, the \nrisk/benefit of Yescarta has not been established in this population. \n \nCytokine release syndrome \n \nNearly all patients experienced some degree of CRS.  Severe CRS, including life-threatening and fatal \nreactions, was very commonly observed with Yescarta with a time to onset of 1 to 12 days (see section \n4.8). CRS should be managed at the physician\u2019s discretion, based on the patient\u2019s clinical presentation \nand according to the CRS management algorithm provided in Table 1. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor \ninhibitor based therapy such as tocilizumab has been administered for moderate or severe CRS \nassociated with Yescarta.  \n \nAt least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient must be on site and available for administration prior to \nYescarta infusion. The treatment centre should have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within \n8 hours of each previous dose.  \nMonitor patients daily for signs and symptoms of CRS for at least 10 days following infusion at the \nqualified clinical facility.  After the first 10 days following infusion, the patient should be monitored at \nthe physician\u2019s discretion. \n \nCounsel patients to remain within proximity of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks \nfollowing infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur.  \nTreatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate some of the CRS symptoms experienced by \npatients on Yescarta.  These include the use of tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids for \nmoderate, severe, or life-threatening CRS as summarised in Table 1.  Patients who experience Grade 2 \nor higher CRS (e.g. hypotension, not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requiring supplemental \noxygenation) should be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  For patients \nexperiencing severe CRS, consider performing an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.  For \nsevere or life-threatening CRS, consider intensive-care supportive therapy. \n \nYescarta should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disease until \nthese conditions have resolved. \n \nCRS has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, renal, cardiac, and \npulmonary).  In addition worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in the setting of CRS.  \nPatients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction should be managed by standards of critical \ncare and measures such as echocardiography should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nDiagnosis of CRS requires excluding alternate causes of systemic inflammatory response, including \ninfection.  In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum \nantibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. \n \nEvaluation for haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) \nshould be considered in patients with severe or unresponsive CRS. \n \nYescarta continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and corticosteroids.  \nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists are not recommended for management of \nYescarta-associated CRS. \n \nTable 1: CRS grading and management guidance \n \nCRS Grade (a) Tocilizumab Corticosteroids \nGrade 1 \nSymptoms require \nsymptomatic treatment only \n(e.g., fever, nausea, fatigue, \nheadache, myalgia, \nmalaise). \n\nN/A N/A \n\nGrade 2 \nSymptoms require and \nrespond to moderate \nintervention. \nOxygen requirement less \nthan 40% FiO2 or \nhypotension responsive to \nfluids or low dose of one \nvasopressor or Grade 2 \norgan toxicity (b). \n\nAdminister tocilizumab (c) 8 mg/kg \nintravenously over 1 hour (not to exceed \n800 mg). \nRepeat tocilizumab every 8 hours as needed if \nnot responsive to intravenous fluids or \nincreasing supplemental oxygen. Limit to a \nmaximum of 3 doses in a 24 hour period; \nmaximum total of 4 doses if no clinical \nimprovement in the signs and symptoms of \nCRS, or if no response to second or subsequent \ndoses of tocilizumab, consider alternative \nmeasures for treatment of cytokine release \nsyndrome.  \n\nManage per Grade 3 if no \nimprovement within 24 hours \nafter starting tocilizumab. \n\n \n\nGrade 3 \nSymptoms require and \nrespond to aggressive \nintervention. \nOxygen requirement greater \nthan or equal to 40% FiO2 \nor hypotension requiring \nhigh-dose or multiple \nvasopressors or Grade 3 \norgan toxicity or Grade 4 \ntransaminitis. \n\nPer Grade 2 \n \n\nAdminister methylprednisolone \n1 mg/kg intravenously twice \ndaily or equivalent \ndexamethasone (e.g., 10 mg \nintravenously every 6 hours).  \nContinue corticosteroids use \nuntil the event is Grade 1 or \nless, then taper over 3 days. \nIf not improving, manage as \nGrade 4 (below). \n\nGrade 4 \nLife-threatening symptoms. \nRequirements for ventilator \nsupport or continuous \nveno-venous haemodialysis \nor Grade 4 organ toxicity \n(excluding transaminitis). \n\nPer Grade 2 \n \n\nAdminister \nmethylprednisolone 1000 mg \nintravenously per day for \n3 days; if improves, then \nmanage as above. \n \nConsider alternate \nimmunosuppressants if no \nimprovement or if condition \nworsens. \n\nN/A = not available/not applicable \n(a) Lee et al 2014.  \n(b) Refer to Table 2 for management of neurologic adverse reactions. \n(c) Refer to tocilizumab summary of product characteristics for details. \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nNeurologic adverse reactions \n \nSevere neurologic adverse reactions have been very commonly observed in patients treated with \nYescarta, which could be life-threatening or fatal (see section 4.8).  Patients with a history of CNS \ndisorders such as seizures or cerebrovascular ischaemia may be at increased risk.  Fatal and serious \ncases of cerebral oedema have been reported in patients treated with Yescarta.  Patients should be \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of neurologic adverse reactions (Table 2).  Patients should be \nmonitored at least daily for 10 days at the qualified healthcare facility following infusion for signs and \nsymptoms of neurologic toxicity.  After the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be \nmonitored at the physician\u2019s discretion.  Counsel patients to remain within proximity of a qualified \nclinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should \nsigns or symptoms of neurologic toxicity occur.  Monitoring of vital signs and organ functions should \nbe considered depending on the severity of the reaction. \n \nPatients who experience Grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicities should be monitored with continuous \ncardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  Provide intensive-care supportive therapy for severe or life-\nthreatening neurologic toxicities.  Non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines should be considered as \nclinically indicated for Grade 2 or higher adverse reactions.  Treatment algorithms have been \ndeveloped to ameliorate the neurologic adverse reactions experienced by patients on Yescarta.  These \ninclude the use of tocilizumab (if concurrent CRS) and/or corticosteroids for moderate, severe, or life-\nthreatening neurologic adverse reactions as summarised in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Neurologic adverse reaction grading and management guidance \n \n\nGrading \nassessment \n\nConcurrent CRS No concurrent CRS \n\nGrade 2 Administer tocilizumab per Table 1 for management of \nGrade 2 CRS. \nIf no improvement within 24 hours after starting \ntocilizumab, administer dexamethasone 10 mg \nintravenously every 6 hours if not already taking other \ncorticosteroids.  Continue dexamethasone use until the \nevent is Grade 1 or less, then taper over 3 days. \n\nAdminister dexamethasone \n10 mg intravenously every \n6 hours. \nContinue dexamethasone use \nuntil the event is Grade 1 or less, \nthen taper over 3 days. \n\nConsider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. \nGrade 3 Administer tocilizumab per Table 1 for management of \n\nGrade 2 CRS.  \nIn addition, administer dexamethasone 10 mg \nintravenously with the first dose of tocilizumab and \nrepeat dose every 6 hours.  Continue dexamethasone \nuse until the event is Grade 1 or less, then taper over 3 \ndays. \n\nAdminister dexamethasone \n10 mg intravenously every \n6 hours.  \nContinue dexamethasone use \nuntil the event is Grade 1 or less, \nthen taper over 3 days.  \n\nConsider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. \n\nGrade 4 Administer tocilizumab per Table 1 for management of \nGrade 2 CRS.  \nAdminister methylprednisolone 1000 mg intravenously \nper day with first dose of tocilizumab and continue \nmethylprednisolone 1000 mg intravenously per day for \n2 more days; if improves, then manage as above. \n \n\nAdminister methylprednisolone \n1000 mg intravenously per day \nfor 3 days; if improves, then \nmanage as above. \n \n\nConsider non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines (e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis. \n \nInfections and febrile neutropenia \n \nSerious infections have been very commonly observed with Yescarta (see section 4.8).  Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection before, during, and after Yescarta infusion \nand treated appropriately.  Prophylactic anti-microbials should be administered according to standard \ninstitutional guidelines. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nFebrile neutropenia has been observed in patients after Yescarta infusion (see section 4.8) and may be \nconcurrent with CRS.  In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with \nbroad spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. \n \nHBV reactivation \n \nHBV reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur \nin patients treated with drugs directed against B cells.  Screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV should be \nperformed in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing of \nYescarta. \n \nProlonged cytopenias \n \nPatients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and \nYescarta infusion.  Grade 3 or higher prolonged cytopenias following Yescarta infusion occurred very \ncommonly and included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia.  Monitor blood counts after \nYescarta infusion. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \n \nB-cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with \nYescarta.  Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been very commonly observed in patients treated with \nYescarta.  Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with Yescarta and managed \nusing infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions \n \nAllergic reactions may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.  Serious hypersensitivity reactions \nincluding anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or residual gentamicin in Yescarta. \n \nSecondary malignancies \n \nPatients treated with Yescarta may develop secondary malignancies.  Monitor patients life-long for \nsecondary malignancies.  In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact the company to \nobtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing. \n \nTumour lysis syndrome (TLS) \n \nTLS, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed.  To minimise risk of TLS, patients with \nelevated uric acid or high tumour burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, \nprior to Yescarta infusion.  Signs and symptoms of TLS should be monitored and events managed \naccording to standard guidelines. \n \nPrior treatment with anti-CD19 therapy \n \nThere is limited experience with Yescarta in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy.  \nYescarta is not recommended if the patient has relapsed with CD19-negative disease after prior \nanti-CD19 therapy. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains 300 mg sodium per infusion, equivalent to 15% of the WHO \nrecommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed with Yescarta. \n \nLive vaccines \n \nThe safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not \nbeen studied.  Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to \nthe start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Yescarta treatment, and until immune recovery \nfollowing treatment with Yescarta. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception \n \nThe pregnancy status of women of child bearing potential must be verified before starting Yescarta \ntreatment. \n \nSee the prescribing information for lymphodepleting chemotherapy for information on the need for \neffective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. \n \nThere are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommendation concerning duration of \ncontraception following treatment with Yescarta. \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no available data with Yescarta use in pregnant women.  No reproductive and \ndevelopmental toxicity animal studies have been conducted with Yescarta to assess whether it can \ncause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). \n \nIt is not known if Yescarta has the potential to be transferred to the foetus.  Based on the mechanism \nof action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including B-cell \nlymphocytopenia.  Therefore, Yescarta is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for \nwomen of childbearing potential not using contraception.  Pregnant women should be advised on the \npotential risks to the foetus.  Pregnancy after Yescarta therapy should be discussed with the treating \nphysician.  \n \nAssessment of immunoglobulin levels and B-cells in newborns of mothers treated with Yescarta \nshould be considered. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether Yescarta is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding child.  \nBreast-feeding women should be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.  \n \nFertility \n \nNo clinical data on the effect of Yescarta on fertility are available.  Effects on male and female fertility \nhave not been evaluated in animal studies. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nYescarta has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Due to the potential for \nneurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients should refrain from driving or \noperating heavy or potentially dangerous machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until \nresolution of neurologic adverse reactions. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe safety data described in this section reflect exposure to Yescarta in ZUMA-1, a Phase 1/2 study in \nwhich 108 patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin  \nlymphoma (NHL) received CAR-positive T cells based on a recommended dose which was weight-\nbased. The median duration of follow up was 27.4 months.   \n \nThe most significant and frequently occurring adverse reactions were CRS (93%), encephalopathy \n(58%), and infections (39%). \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 56% of patients.  The most common serious adverse reactions \nincluded encephalopathy (22%), unspecified pathogen infections (16%), bacterial infections (6%), \nfebrile neutropenia (6%), viral infections (5%), and pyrexia (5%).  \n \nThe most common Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions included encephalopathy (31%), unspecified \npathogen infections (19%), CRS (11%), bacterial infection (9%), aphasia (7%), viral infection (6%), \ndelirium (6%), hypotension (6%), and hypertension (6%). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions reported from clinical trials and post-marketing setting are presented below.  These \nreactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency.  Frequencies are defined as: very \ncommon (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \n< 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000).  Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented \nin the order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 3: Adverse drug reactions identified with Yescarta \n \nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Frequency Adverse reactions \nInfections and infestations  \n Very common Unspecified pathogen infections \n\nViral infections \nBacterial infections \n\nCommon Fungal infections \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n Very common Leukopenia \n\nNeutropenia \nAnaemia \nThrombocytopenia \n\nCommon Coagulopathy \nImmune system disorders \n Very common Cytokine Release Syndrome  \n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia  \nCommon Hypersensitivity \n\nHistiocytosis Haematophagic \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \n Very common Dehydration \n\nDecreased appetite \nHypophosphataemia \nHyponatraemia \nWeight decrease  \n\nCommon Hypocalcaemia \nHypoalbuminaemia \n\nPsychiatric disorders \n Very common Delirium  \n\nAnxiety \nCommon Insomnia   \n\n\n\n11 \n\nSystem Organ Class (SOC) Frequency Adverse reactions \nNervous system disorders \n Very common Encephalopathy \n\nHeadache \nTremor \nDizziness \nAphasia \n\nCommon Ataxia \nNeuropathy \nSeizure \nDyscalculia \nMyoclonus \n\nUncommon Spinal cord oedema \nMyelitis \nQuadriplegia \n\nCardiac disorders \n Very common Tachycardia \n\nArrhythmia  \nCommon Cardiac arrest \n\nCardiac failure \nVascular disorders \n Very common Hypotension \n\nHypertension  \nCommon Thrombosis \n\nCapillary leak syndrome \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n Very common Cough  \n\nDyspnoea \nHypoxia \nPleural effusion \n\nCommon Pulmonary oedema \nGastrointestinal disorders \n Very common Diarrhoea \n\nNausea \nVomiting \nConstipation \nAbdominal pain \nDry mouth \n\nCommon Dysphagia* \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n Common Rash \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n Very common Motor dysfunction \n\nPain in extremity \nBack pain \nArthralgia \nMuscle pain \n\nRenal and urinary disorders \n Common Renal insufficiency \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n Very common Fatigue \n\nPyrexia \nOedema \nChills \n\nInvestigations \n Very common Alanine aminotransferase increased \n\nAspartate aminotransferase \nincreased \n\nCommon Bilirubin increased \nOnly cytopenias that resulted in (i) new or worsening clinical sequelae or (ii) that required therapy or (iii) adjustment in \ncurrent therapy are included in Table 3. \n* Dysphagia has been reported in the setting of neurologic toxicity and encephalopathy \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nCytokine release syndrome  \nCRS occurred in 93% of patients. Eleven percent (11%) of patients experienced Grade 3 or higher \n(severe, life-threatening, and fatal) CRS.  The median time to onset was 2 days (range: 1 to 12 days) \nand the median duration was 7 days (range: 2 to 29 days).  Ninety-eight percent (98%) of patients \nrecovered from CRS. \n \nThe most common signs or symptoms associated with CRS included pyrexia (83%), hypotension \n(44%), tachycardia (24%), hypoxia (23%), and chills (20%).  Serious adverse reactions that may be \nassociated with CRS included acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac \narrest, cardiac failure, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and HLH/MAS.  See section 4.4 \nfor monitoring and management guidance. \n \nNeurologic adverse reactions \nNeurologic adverse reactions occurred in 67% of patients. Thirty-two percent (32%) of patients \nexperienced Grade 3 or higher (severe or life-threatening) adverse reactions.  The median time to onset \nwas 5 days (range: 1 to 17 days).  The median duration was 13 days (range: 1 to 191 days).  Most \npatients recovered from neurologic adverse reactions, with the exception of 4 patients who had \nongoing neurologic adverse reactions at the time of death; the deaths were due to other causes. \n \nThe most common signs or symptoms associated with neurologic adverse reactions included \nencephalopathy (58%), headache (40%), tremor (31%), dizziness (21%), aphasia (18%), and delirium \n(17%).  Serious adverse reactions including encephalopathy (22%), aphasia (4%), delirium (4%), and \nseizures (1%) have been reported in patients administered Yescarta. \n \nOther neurologic adverse reactions have been reported less frequently in clinical trials and included \ndysphagia (5%), myelitis (0.2%), and quadriplegia (0.2%). \n \nSpinal cord oedema was reported, in the context of neurologic toxicity in the post-marketing setting.   \n \nSee section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nFebrile neutropenia and infections  \nFebrile neutropenia was observed in 36% of patients after Yescarta infusion.  Infections occurred in \n39% of patients in ZUMA-1.  Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) infections occurred \nin 26% of patients.  Grade 3 or higher unspecified pathogen, bacterial, and viral infections occurred in \n19%, 9%, and 6% of patients respectively.  The most common site of infection was in the respiratory \ntract.  See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nProlonged cytopenias  \nGrade 3 or higher neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), anaemia, and thrombocytopenia \noccurred in 80%, 45%, and 40% of patients, respectively.  Prolonged (still present at Day 30 or with \nan onset at Day 30 or beyond) Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia \noccurred in 26%, 24%, and 10% of patients, respectively.  Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia, and anaemia present after Day 93 occurred in 11%, 7%, and 3% of patients, \nrespectively. See section 4.4 for management guidance. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nIn ZUMA-1, hypogammaglobulinaemia occurred in 16% of patients.  Cumulatively, 33 (31%) of 108 \nsubjects received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy at the time of the 24-month analysis.  See \nsection 4.4 for management guidance. \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \nImmunogenicity  \n \nThe immunogenicity of Yescarta has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \n(ELISA) for the detection of binding antibodies against FMC63, the originating antibody of the \nanti-CD19 CAR.  Three patients tested positive for anti-FMC63 prior to being treated with Yescarta.  \nAn impact of these antibodies on efficacy or safety was not discernible. \n \nSpecial population \n \nThere is limited experience with Yescarta in patients \u2265 75 years of age.  Generally, safety and efficacy \nwere similar between patients \u2265 65 years and patients < 65 years of age treated with Yescarta.  \nOutcomes were consistent between patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of 0 \nand 1 and by sex. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThere are no data regarding the signs of overdose with Yescarta. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: not yet assigned \n \nMechanism of action \n \nYescarta, an engineered autologous T-cell immunotherapy product, binds to CD19 expressing cancer \ncells and normal B cells.  Following anti-CD19 CAR T-cell engagement with CD19 expressing target \ncells, the CD28 and CD3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate downstream signalling cascades that \nlead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions, and secretion of inflammatory \ncytokines and chemokines.  This sequence of events leads to apoptosis and necrosis of CD19-\nexpressing target cells. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \n \nIn phase 2 of ZUMA-1, after Yescarta infusion, pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated over a \n4-week interval by measuring transient elevation of cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules in \nblood.  Levels of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and \nIL2R\u03b1 were analyzed.  Peak elevation was observed within the first 14 days after infusion, and levels \ngenerally returned to baseline within 28 days.  \n \nDue to the on-target, off-tumour effect of Yescarta, a period of B-cell aplasia is expected following \ntreatment. Among 73 patients with evaluable samples at baseline, 40% had detectable B-cells; the \nB-cell aplasia observed in the majority of patients at baseline was attributed to prior therapies. \nFollowing Yescarta treatment, the proportion of patients with detectable B-cells decreased: 20% had \ndetectable B-cells at Month 3, and 22% had detectable B-cells at Month 6. The initiation of B-cell \nrecovery was first noted at Month 9, when 56% of patients had detectable B-cells. This trend of B-cell \nrecovery continued over time, as 64% of patients had detectable B-cells at Month 18, and 77% of \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n14 \n\npatients had detectable B-cells at Month 24. Patients were not required to be followed after they \nprogressed; thus, the majority of patients with evaluable samples were responders. \n \nAnalyses performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of CRS or \nneurologic events showed that higher levels (peak and AUC at 1 month) of IL-15, as well as IL-6, \nwere associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic adverse reactions and Grade 3 or higher CRS. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \n \nDLBCL, PMBCL and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (ZUMA-1) \nA total of 108 patients were treated with Yescarta in a phase 1/2 open-label, multicentre, single-arm \nstudy in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.  Efficacy was based on \n101 patients in phase 2, including histologically confirmed DLBCL (N = 77), PMBCL (N = 8), or \nDLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, (N = 16) based on the 2008 WHO-classification.  DLBCL \nin ZUMA-1 included patients with DLBCL NOS, other DLBCL subtypes, and high-grade B-cell \nlymphoma (HGBCL) based on the 2016 WHO-classification.  Forty-seven patients were evaluable for \nMYC, BCL-2, and BCL-6 status.  Thirty were found to have double expressor DLBCL \n(overexpression of both MYC and BCL-2 protein); 5 were found to have HGBCL with MYC, BCL-2 \nor BCL-6 gene rearrangement (double- and triple-hit); and 2 were found to have HGBCL not \notherwise specified.  Sixty-six patients were evaluable for cell-of-origin classifications (germinal \ncenter B-cell type [GCB] or activated B-cell type [ABC]).  Of these, 49 patients had GCB-type and \n17 patients had ABC-type.   \n \nEligible patients were \u2265 18 years of age with refractory disease defined as progressive disease (PD) or \nstable disease (SD) as best response to last line of therapy, or disease progression within 12 months \nafter autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).  Patients who were refractory to chemotherapy or who \nrelapsed after two or more lines of systemic therapy were generally ineligible for haematopoietic stem \ncell transplantation.  Patients must have received at least prior anti-CD20 antibody therapy and an \nanthracycline containing regimen.  Patients with CNS lymphoma, a history of allogeneic stem cell \ntransplantation (SCT) or prior anti-CD19 CAR or other genetically modified T-cell therapy were \nexcluded.  Patients with a history of CNS disorders (such as seizures or cerebrovascular ischemia), \ncardiac ejection fraction of less than 50% or room air oxygen saturation of less than 92%, or \nautoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression were ineligible.  The median duration of \nfollow up was 27.1 months (still ongoing).

Bridging chemotherapy \nbetween leukapheresis and lymphodepleting chemotherapy was not permitted.  All patients were \nhospitalized for observation for a minimum of 7 days after Yescarta infusion. \n \nOf 111 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 101 received Yescarta.  Nine patients were not treated, \nprimarily due to progressive disease or serious adverse events after enrolment and prior to cell \ndelivery.  One out of 111 patients did not receive the product due to manufacturing failure.  The \nmedian time from leukapheresis to product delivery was 17 days (range: 14 to 51 days), and the \nmedian time from leukapheresis to infusion was 24 days (range: 16 to 73 days).  The median dose was \n2.0 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  ITT was defined as all patients who underwent leukapheresis; \nmITT was defined as all patients who received Yescarta. \n \nThe primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR).  Secondary endpoints included duration of \nresponse (DOR), overall survival (OS), and severity of adverse events.  The ORR was prespecified to \nbe tested in the first 92 treated patients and was significantly higher than the prespecified rate of 20% \n(P < 0.0001). \n \nIn the primary analysis, based on the mITT population (minimum follow up of 6 months) the ORR \nwas 72% and the complete response (CR) rate was 51%, as determined by an independent review \ncommittee.  In the 12-month follow-up analysis (Table 5), the ORR was 72% and the CR rate was \n51%.  The median time to response was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 to 6.3 months).  The DOR was longer \nin patients who achieved CR, as compared to patients with a best response of partial response (PR).  \nOf the 52 patients who achieved CR, 7 patients had SD and 9 had PR at their initial tumour assessment \nand converted to CR as late as 6.5 months.  The ORR results within PMBCL and DLBCL arising from \nfollicular lymphoma were both 88%.  CR rates were 75% and 56%, respectively.  Of the 111 patients \nin the ITT population, the ORR was 66% and the CR was 47%.  Other outcomes were consistent with \nthose of the mITT population. \n \nIn the 24-month follow-up analysis, based on the mITT population (results from an independent \nreview committee), the ORR and the CR rate were 74% and 54%, respectively.  The median time to \nresponse was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 to 12.2 months).  The DOR was longer in patients who achieved \nCR compared to patients with a best response of PR (Table 5). Of the 55 patients who achieved CR, 7 \npatients had SD and 10 had PR at their initial tumour assessment and converted to CR as late as 12 \nmonths after Yescarta infusion.  Median duration of response and median overall survival have not \nbeen reached (Table 5). \n \nIn the phase 1 part of ZUMA-1, 7 patients were treated.  Five patients responded, including 4 CRs.  At \nthe 12-month follow-up analysis, 3 patients remained in CR 24 months after Yescarta infusion.  At the \n24-month follow-up analysis, these 3 patients remained in CR at 30 to 35 months after Yescarta \ninfusion. \n \n\n\n\n16 \n\nTable 5.

The 24-month analysis had a median follow-up of \n27.1 months. OS relates to the time from the leukapheresis date (ITT) or Yescarta infusion (mITT) to death from any cause. \n \nSCHOLAR-1 \nA retrospective, patient-level, pooled analysis of outcomes in refractory aggressive NHL (N = 636) \nwas conducted (Crump et al., 2017) to provide confirmation of the prespecified control response rate \nof 20% and historical context for interpreting the ZUMA-1 results.  The analysis included patients \nwho had not responded (SD or PD) to their last line of therapy, or had relapsed within 12 months after \nASCT.  Response and survival after treatment with available standard-of-care therapy was evaluated.  \nThe ORR was 26% [95% CI (21, 31)] and the CR rate was 7% [95% CI (3, 15)], with a median OS of \n6.3 months. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPeak levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells occurred within the first 8 to 15 days after Yescarta infusion.  \nThe median peak level of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in the blood (Cmax) was 38.3 cells/\u00b5L (range: 0.8 to \n1513.7 cells/\u03bcL), which decreased to a median of 2.1 cells/\u00b5L by 1 month (range: 0 to 167.4 cells/\u03bcL) \nand to a median of 0.4 cells/\u00b5L by 3 months (range: 0 to 28.4 cells/\u03bcL) after Yescarta infusion. \n \nAge (range: 23 to 76 years) and sex had no significant impact on AUC and Cmax of Yescarta. \n \nThe number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in the blood was positively associated with objective response \n(CR or PR).  The median anti-CD19 CAR T cell Cmax level in responders (N = 71) was 216% higher \ncompared to the corresponding level in nonresponders (N = 25) (43.6 cells/\u03bcL versus 20.2 cells/\u03bcL).  \nMedian AUCDay 0-28 in responding patients (N = 71) was 253% of the corresponding level in \nnonresponders (N = 25) (562.0 days x cells/\u03bcL versus 222.0 days x cells/\u03bcL). \n \nYescarta comprises human autologous T cells. The anticipated metabolic products are typical cellular \ndegradation products resulting from normal cellular clearance mechanisms. Thus, the infused CAR T \ncells are expected to be cleared over time. Anti-CD19 CAR T cell levels decreased toward background \nlevels by Month 3 after infusion.  \nStudies of Yescarta in patients with hepatic and renal impairment were not conducted. \n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nYescarta comprises engineered human T cells, therefore there are no representative in vitro assays, ex \nvivo models, or in vivo models that can accurately address the toxicological characteristics of the \nhuman product.  Hence, traditional toxicology studies used for drug development were not performed.  \n \nNo carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with Yescarta. \n \nNo studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of Yescarta on fertility, reproduction, and \ndevelopment. \n \n \n6.

What you need to know before you are given Yescarta  \n3. How Yescarta is given  \n4. Possible side effects  \n5. How to store Yescarta  \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Yescarta is and what it is used for \n \nYescarta is a type of medicine called a \u201cgenetically modified cell therapy\u201d.  \n \nYescarta is made specially for you as a single administration of your own modified white blood cells.  \nIt is given by a drip (infusion) into a vein (intravenously). \n \nIt is used to treat aggressive conditions in adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and \nprimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) affecting your lymph tissue (part of the immune \nsystem) that affects a type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes and other organs in your body.  \nToo many of these abnormal white blood cells accumulate in your tissue and this is the cause of the \nsymptoms you may have.  It is used to treat these conditions when other available medicines have \nstopped working for you.  \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you are given Yescarta \n \nYou should not be given Yescarta if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of this medicine (listed \nin section 6).  If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. \n \nWarnings and precautions  \n \nYescarta is made from your own white blood cells and should only be given to you. \n \nBefore you are given Yescarta you should tell your doctor if you: \n- have problems with your nervous system (such as fits, stroke, or memory loss). \n- have kidney problems. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n- have low blood cell levels (blood counts). \n- have had a stem cell transplant in the last 4 months. \n- have any lung, heart or blood pressure (low or raised) problems. \n- have signs or symptoms of graft-versus-host disease.  This happens when transplanted cells \n\nattack your body, causing symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and bloody \nstools. \n\n- notice the symptoms of your cancer are getting worse.  If you have lymphoma this might \ninclude fever, feeling weak, night sweats, sudden weight loss. \n\n- have an infection.  The infection will be treated before the Yescarta infusion. \n- have had hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. \n\n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor before being given \nYescarta. \n \nTests and checks \nBefore you are given Yescarta your doctor will: \n\u2022 Check your lungs, heart and blood pressure. \n\u2022 Look for signs of infection; any infection will be treated before you are given Yescarta. \n\u2022 Check if your cancer is getting worse. \n\u2022 Look for signs of graft-versus-host disease that can happen after a transplant. \n\u2022 Check your blood for uric acid and for how many cancer cells there are in your blood.  This will \n\nshow if you are likely to develop a condition called tumour lysis syndrome.  You may be given \nmedicines to help prevent the condition. \n\n\u2022 Check for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection. \n\u2022 Check if you had a vaccination in the previous 6 weeks or are planning to have one in the next \n\nfew months. \n \nAfter you have been given Yescarta \nTell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any of the following: \n\u2022 Chills, extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or rapid \n\nheartbeat, which may be symptoms of a condition known as cytokine release syndrome.  Take \nyour temperature twice a day for 3-4 weeks after treatment with Yescarta.  If your temperature \nis high, see your doctor immediately. \n\n\u2022 Fits, shaking, or difficulty speaking or slurred speech, loss of consciousness or decreased level \nof consciousness, confusion and disorientation, loss of balance or coordination. \n\n\u2022 Fever, which may be a symptom of an infection. \n\u2022 Extreme tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath, which may be symptoms of a lack of red \n\nblood cells. \n\u2022 Bleeding or bruising more easily, which may be symptoms of low levels of cells in the blood \n\nknown as platelets. \n \n\nYour doctor will regularly check your blood counts as the number of blood cells and other blood \ncomponents may decrease. \n \nDo not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplants. \n \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given \nYescarta.  Your doctor may need to take special care of you during your treatment with Yescarta. \n \nIn some cases, it might not be possible to go ahead with the planned treatment with Yescarta.  For \nexample:  \n \n- If Yescarta infusion is delayed for more than 2 weeks after you have received preparatory \n\nchemotherapy you may have to receive more preparative chemotherapy. \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nChildren and adolescents \n \nYescarta should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. \n \nOther medicines and Yescarta \n \nTell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. \n \nBefore you are given Yescarta tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any medicines that weaken \nyour immune system such as corticosteroids, since these medicines may interfere with the effect of \nYescarta. \n \nIn particular, you must not be given certain vaccines called live vaccines: \n\u2022 In the 6 weeks before you are given the short course of chemotherapy (called lymphodepleting \n\nchemotherapy) to prepare your body for the Yescarta cells. \n\u2022 During Yescarta treatment. \n\u2022 After treatment while the immune system is recovering. \n \nTalk to your doctor if you need to have any vaccinations. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor for advice before being given this medicine.  This is because the effects of Yescarta in \npregnant or breast-feeding women are not known, and it may harm your unborn baby or your \nbreast-fed child. \n\u2022 If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant after treatment with Yescarta, talk to your \n\ndoctor immediately. \n\u2022 You will be given a pregnancy test before treatment starts.  Yescarta should only be given if the \n\nresults show you are not pregnant. \n \nDiscuss pregnancy with your doctor if you have received Yescarta. \n \nDriving and using machines \nSome people may feel tired, dizzy or have some shaking after being given Yescarta.  If this happens to \nyou, do not drive or use heavy machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until your doctor tells \nyou that you have completely recovered. \n \nYescarta contains sodium \nThis medicine contains 300 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each infusion.  This \nis the equivalent to 15% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. \n \n \n3. How Yescarta is given \n \nYescarta will always be given to you by a healthcare professional. \n \n\u2022 Since Yescarta is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you \n\nto prepare your medicine.  Your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in \nyour vein (a procedure call leukapheresis).  Some of your white blood cells are separated from \nyour blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein.  This can take 3 to 6 hours and \nmay need to be repeated. \n\n\u2022 Your white blood cells are frozen and sent away to make Yescarta.  It usually takes about 3 to 4 \nweeks to receive your Yescarta therapy but the time may vary. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\nMedicines given before Yescarta treatment \nDuring the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Yescarta you may be given other medicines.  This is \nto help prevent infusion reactions and fever.  These other medicines may include: \n\u2022 Paracetamol. \n\u2022 An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. \n \nPrior to receiving Yescarta, you will be given other medicines such as preparative chemotherapy, \nwhich will allow your modified white blood cells in Yescarta to multiply in your body when the \nmedicine is given to you. \n \nYour doctor or nurse will check carefully that this medicine is yours. \n \nHow you are given Yescarta \n\u2022 Yescarta is a one-time treatment.  It will not be given to you again. \n\u2022 Your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of Yescarta into your vein for \n\napproximately 30 minutes. \n\u2022 Yescarta contains human blood cells. Your doctor handling Yescarta will therefore take \n\nappropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of \ninfectious diseases. \n\n \nYou must receive Yescarta infusion in a qualified clinical facility and be discharged only when your \ndoctor thinks it is safe for you to go home. \nYour doctor may do blood tests to check for side effects. \n \nAfter you are given Yescarta \n\u2022 Plan to stay within proximity from the hospital where you were treated for at least 4 weeks after \n\nyou have been given Yescarta.  Your doctor will recommend that you return to the hospital \ndaily for at least 10 days and will consider whether you need to stay at the hospital as an \nin-patient for the first 10 days after infusion.  This is so your doctor can check if your treatment \nis working and help you if you have any side effects. \n\n \nIf you miss any appointments, call your doctor or the qualified clinical facility as soon as possible to \nreschedule your appointment. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nYescarta can cause side effects to your immune system that may be serious or life-threatening, and can \nlead to death.  \n \nThe following side effects have been reported with Yescarta. \n\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) \n- Fever, chills, reduced blood pressure which may cause symptoms such as dizziness, \n\nlightheadedness, fluid in the lungs, which may be severe and can be fatal (all symptoms of a \ncondition called cytokine release syndrome). \n\n- Fever or chills. \n- Decrease in the number of red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen) which may cause you to feel \n\nextremely tired with a loss of energy.  \n- Low blood pressure, dizziness. \n- Feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, pain in the stomach or being sick. \n- Headache, depressed level of consciousness, difficulty in speaking, agitation, shaking. \n- Decrease in the number of white blood cells, which are important for fighting infections. \n- Decreased levels of sodium, phosphate, or potassium which will show up on blood tests.   \n\n\n\n33 \n\n- Changes in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat. \n- Anxiety. \n- Decrease in the number of cells that help clot the blood (thrombocytopenia). \n- Infections in the blood caused by bacteria, viruses or other types of infection.  \n- Shortness of breath, cough.  \n- Low levels of antibodies called immunoglobulins, which may lead to infections. \n- High blood pressure. \n- Swelling in the limbs, fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion). \n- Muscle and joint pain, back pain. \n- Extreme tiredness.  \n- Dehydration. \n- Decreased appetite, weight loss. \n- Confusion. \n- Increased levels of liver enzymes which will show up on blood tests. \n- Dry mouth.  \n- Low oxygen level in blood.   \n- Pain in the hands or feet.  \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) \n\n- Difficulty understanding numbers, memory loss, fits, loss of control of body movements. \n- Failure of the kidneys causing your body to hold onto fluid which can be serious or life \n\nthreatening. \n- Fluid in the lungs.  \n- Lung infection.  \n- Sudden, unexpected stopping of the heart (cardiac arrest); this is serious and life-threatening. \n- Heart failure. \n- Muscle spasms.  \n- Difficulty to swallow. \n- Leakage of fluids from blood vessels into surrounding tissue.

There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments.  \n \nThis leaflet is available in all EU/EEA languages on the European Medicines Agency website. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nThe following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: \n\n\n\n36 \n\nPreparation of Yescarta \n\u2022 Verify that the patient\u2019s identity (ID) matches the patient identifiers on the Yescarta cassette.  \n\u2022 The Yescarta product bag must not be removed from the cassette if the information on the \n\npatient-specific label does not match the intended patient. \n\u2022 Once the patient\u2019s ID is confirmed, remove the Yescarta product bag from the cassette. \n\u2022 Check that the patient information on the cassette label matches that on the bag label. \n\u2022 Inspect the product bag for any breaches of container integrity before thawing.  If the bag is \n\ncompromised, follow the local guidelines (or immediately contact Kite). \n\u2022 Place the infusion bag inside a second sterile bag or per local guidelines. \n\u2022 Thaw Yescarta at approximately 37 \u00b0C using either a water bath or dry thaw method until there \n\nis no visible ice in the infusion bag.  Gently mix the contents of the bag to disperse clumps of \ncellular material.  If visible cell clumps remain, continue to gently mix the contents of the bag.  \nSmall clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing.  Yescarta should \nnot be washed, spun down, and/or re-suspended in new media prior to infusion.  Thawing \nshould take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. \n\n\u2022 Once thawed, Yescarta is stable at room temperature (20 \u02daC-25 \u02daC) for up to 3 hours. \n \nDo NOT use a leukodepleting filter. \n \nAdministration \n\u2022 Yescarta intravenous infusion should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by a \n\nHCP experienced in the treatment of haematological malignancies and trained for \nadministration and management of patient treated with Yescarta.  \n\n\u2022 Ensure that at least 1 dose of tocilizumab per patient and emergency equipment are available \nprior to infusion and during the recovery period. Hospitals should have access to an additional \ndose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose.  \n\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s identity should be matched with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag.  \n\u2022 Yescarta is for autologous use only.  \n\u2022 Yescarta should be administered as an intravenous infusion using latex-free intravenous tubing \n\nwithout a leukocyte depleting filter within 30 minutes by either gravity or a peristaltic pump.  \n\u2022 Gently agitate the bag during Yescarta infusion to prevent cell clumping. All contents of the \n\ninfusion bags should be infused.  \n\u2022 Sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) (0.154 mmol sodium per mL) solution for injection \n\nshould be used to prime the tubing prior to infusion as well as rinse it afterwards. Yescarta is \nstable at room temperature for up to 3 hours after thaw. When the full volume of Yescarta has \nbeen infused, the infusion bag should be rinsed with 10 to 30 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL \n(0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to ensure as many cells as possible are infused \ninto the patient.  \n\n \nPrecautions to be taken before handling or administering Yescarta \n\u2022 Yescarta contains genetically-modified human blood cells. Local guidelines on handling of \n\nbiological waste should be followed for disposal. \n\u2022 All material that has been in contact with Yescarta (solid and liquid waste) should be handled \n\nand disposed of as potentially infectious waste in accordance with local guidelines on handling \nof biological waste.  \n\n\u2022 Yescarta should be transported within the facility in closed, break-proof, leak-proof containers \n\u2022 Yescarta is prepared from autologous blood of the patient collected by leukapheresis. Patient \n\nleukapheresis material and Yescarta may carry a risk of transmitting infectious viruses to HCP \nhandling the product. Accordingly, HCP should employ appropriate precautions (wearing \ngloves and glasses) when handling leukapheresis material or Yescarta to avoid potential \ntransmission of infectious diseases. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.

"Section_Content": "yescarta will always be given to you by a healthcare professional. since yescarta is made from your own white blood cells, your cells will be collected from you to prepare your medicine. your doctor will take some of your blood using a catheter placed in your vein (a procedure call leukapheresis). some of your white blood cells are separated from your blood and the rest of your blood is returned to your vein. this can take 3 to 6 hours and may need to be repeated. your white blood cells are frozen and sent away to make yescarta. it usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks to receive your yescarta therapy but the time may vary. medicines given before yescarta treatment during the 30 to 60 minutes before you are given yescarta you may be given other medicines. this is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. these other medicines may include: paracetamol. an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. prior to receiving yescarta, you will be given other medicines such as preparative chemotherapy, which will allow your modified white blood cells in yescarta to multiply in your body when the medicine is given to you. your doctor or nurse will check carefully that this medicine is yours. how you are given yescarta yescarta is a one-time treatment. it will not be given to you again. your doctor or nurse will give you a single infusion of yescarta into your vein for approximately 30 minutes. yescarta contains human blood cells. your doctor handling yescarta will therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential
