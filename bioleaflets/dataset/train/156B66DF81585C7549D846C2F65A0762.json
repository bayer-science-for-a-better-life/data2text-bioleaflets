NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nALPROLIX 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nALPROLIX 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nALPROLIX 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nALPROLIX 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \nALPROLIX 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nALPROLIX 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 250 IU eftrenonacog alfa. After reconstitution, each mL of solution for \ninjection contains approximately 50 IU eftrenonacog alfa.  \n \nALPROLIX 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 500 IU eftrenonacog alfa. After reconstitution, each mL of solution for \ninjection contains approximately 100 IU eftrenonacog alfa. \n \nALPROLIX 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 1000 IU eftrenonacog alfa. After reconstitution, each mL of solution for \ninjection contains approximately 200 IU eftrenonacog alfa.  \n \nALPROLIX 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 2000 IU eftrenonacog alfa. After reconstitution, each mL of solution for \ninjection contains approximately 400 IU eftrenonacog alfa. \n \nALPROLIX 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEach vial contains nominally 3000 IU eftrenonacog alfa. After reconstitution, each mL of solution for \ninjection contains approximately 600 IU eftrenonacog alfa. \n \nThe potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one stage clotting test \nagainst an in-house standard that is referenced to the WHO factor IX standard. The specific activity of \nALPROLIX is 55-84 IU/mg protein. \n \nEftrenonacog alfa (recombinant human coagulation factor IX, Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc)) has 867 amino \nacids. It is a high purity factor product produced by recombinant DNA technology in a human embryonic \nkidney (HEK) cell line, without the addition of any exogenous human- or animal-derived protein in the cell \nculture, purification or final formulation. \n \nExcipient with known effect: 0.3 mmol (6.4 mg) sodium per vial. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \n \nPowder: lyophilised, white to off-white powder or cake. \nSolvent: the solution is clear to colourless. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nTreatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency). \n \nALPROLIX can be used for all age groups. \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTreatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. \n \nPreviously untreated patients \nThe safety and efficacy of ALPROLIX in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. No \ndata are available. \n \nTreatment monitoring \nDuring the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to \nbe administered and the frequency of repeated injections. Individual patients may vary in their response to \nfactor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require \nadjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, \nprecise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is \nindispensable. \n \nWhen using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX \nactivity in patients\u2019 blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the \ntype of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when \nchanging the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.  \nMeasurements with a one-stage clotting assay utilising a kaolin-based aPTT reagent will likely result in an \nunderestimation of activity level. \n \nPosology  \nDose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on the \nlocation and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. \n \nThe number of units of recombinant factor IX Fc administered is expressed in International Units (IU), \nwhich are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is \nexpressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an \nInternational Standard for factor IX in plasma).  \n \nOne International Unit (IU) of recombinant factor IX Fc activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in \none mL of normal human plasma. \n \nOn demand treatment  \nThe calculation of the required dose of recombinant factor IX Fc is based on the empirical finding that 1 \nInternational Unit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 1% of normal \nactivity (IU/dL). The required dose is determined using the following formula:  \n \n\n\n\n4 \n\nRequired units = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (%) (IU/dL) x {reciprocal of observed recovery \n(IU/kg per IU/dL)} \n \nThe amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical \neffectiveness in the individual case. If a repeat dose is required to control the bleed, the prolonged half-life of \nALPROLIX should be taken into account (see section 5.2). The time to peak activity is not expected to be \ndelayed. \n \nIn the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given \nplasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. Table 1 can be used to guide \ndosing in bleeding episodes and surgery: \n \nTable 1: Guide to ALPROLIX dosing for treatment of bleeding episodes and surgery \n\n \n1 In some patients and circumstances the dosing interval can be prolonged up to 48 hours (see section 5.2 for pharmacokinetic data). \n \nProphylaxis  \nFor long term prophylaxis against bleeding, the recommended starting regimens are either: \n\u2022 50 IU/kg once weekly, adjust dose based on individual response or \n\u2022 100 IU/kg once every 10 days, adjust interval based on individual response. Some patients who are \n\nwell-controlled on a once every 10 days regimen might be treated on an interval of 14 days or longer. \n \nThe highest recommended dose for prophylaxis is 100 IU/kg \n \nElderly population  \nThere is limited experience in patients \u2265 65 years. \n \nPaediatric population \nFor children below the age of 12 years, higher or more frequent doses may be required and the recommended \nstarting dose is 50-60 IU/kg every 7 days. For adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the dose \nrecommendations are the same as for adults. See sections 5.1 and 5.2. \nThe highest recommended dose for prophylaxis is 100 IU/kg \n \n\nDegree of haemorrhage \n/ Type of surgical \nprocedure \n\nFactor IX level required \n(%) (IU/dL)  \n\nFrequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of \ntherapy (days) \n \n\nHaemorrhage   \nEarly haemarthrosis, \nmuscle bleeding or oral \nbleeding \n\n20-40 Repeat injection every 48 hours, until the \nbleeding episode as indicated by pain is \nresolved or healing is achieved. \n \n\nMore extensive \nhaemarthrosis, muscle \nbleeding or haematoma \n\n30-60 Repeat injection every 24 to 48 hours until \npain and acute disability are resolved. \n \n\nLife threatening \nhaemorrhages \n\n60-100 Repeat injection every 8 to 24 hours until \nthreat is resolved. \n \n\nSurgery   \nMinor surgery including \ntooth extraction \n\n30-60 Repeat injection after 24 hours, as needed until \nhealing is achieved1. \n \n\nMajor surgery 80-100 \n(pre- and post-operative) \n\nRepeat injection every 8 to 24 hours as \nnecessary until adequate wound healing, then \ntherapy at least for another 7 days to maintain \na factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dL). \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\nMethod of administration  \nIntravenous use.  \n \nIn case of self-administration or administration by a caregiver appropriate training is needed. \n \nALPROLIX should be injected intravenously over several minutes. The rate of administration should be \ndetermined by the patient\u2019s comfort level and should not exceed 10 mL/min.  \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance (recombinant human coagulation factor IX, and/or Fc domain) or to \nany of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nHypersensitivity \nAllergic type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ALPROLIX. If symptoms of \nhypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately \nand contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions \nincluding, hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.  \n \nIn case of anaphylactic shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. \n \nInhibitors \nAfter repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX products, patients should be monitored for the \ndevelopment of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using \nappropriate biological testing.  \n \nThere have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX \ninhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for \nthe presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased \nrisk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.  \n \nBecause of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the initial administrations of factor IX \nshould, according to the treating physician\u2019s judgement, be performed under medical observation where \nproper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. \n \nThromboembolism  \nBecause of the potential risk of thrombotic complications with factor IX products, clinical surveillance for \nearly signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological \ntesting when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-\nborn infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). \nThe benefit of treatment with ALPROLIX in these situations should be weighed against the risk of these \ncomplications. \n \nCardiovascular events \nIn patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the \ncardiovascular risk. \n \nCatheter-related complications  \nIf a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local \ninfections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nRecording of batch number \nIt is strongly recommended that every time that ALPROLIX is administered to a patient, the name and batch \nnumber of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the \nmedicinal product. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. \n \nExcipient related considerations \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially \u201csodium-\nfree\u201d.  \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interactions of ALPROLIX with other medicinal products have been reported. No interaction studies \nhave been performed. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ALPROLIX. A placental transfer study in mice \nwas conducted (see section 5.3). Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience \nregarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX \nshould be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. \n \nFertility \nThere are no fertility data available. No fertility studies have been conducted in animals with ALPROLIX. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nALPROLIX has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nHypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion \nsite, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, \ntachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some \ncases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these reactions have progressed to \nsevere anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX \ninhibitors (see also 4.4). Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance \ninduction in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction. \n \nPatients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such inhibitors \noccur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended \nthat a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. \n \nThere is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX products, with \na higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has been associated with \ninstances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, venous thrombosis and \npulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with thromboembolic \ncomplications. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nThe frequencies in the table below were observed in a total of 153 patients with severe haemophilia B in \nphase III clinical studies and an extension study. Adverse events were monitored for a total of 561 subject-\n\n\n\n7 \n\nyears. The total number of exposure days was 26,106 with a median of 165 (range 1-528) exposure days per \nsubject. \n \nTable 2 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred Term \nLevel). \n \nFrequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common \n(\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not \nknown (cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nTable 2: Adverse reactions reported for ALPROLIX in clinical trials \nMedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reactions Frequency category \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite  Uncommon \nNervous system disorders Headache \n\nDizziness \nDysgeusia \n\n Common \n Uncommon \n Uncommon \n\nCardiac disorders Palpitations  Uncommon \nVascular disorders Hypotension  Uncommon \nGastrointestinal disorders Paresthesia oral \n\nBreath odour \n Common \n Uncommon \n\nRenal and urinary disorders Obstructive uropathy \nHaematuria \nRenal colic \n\n Common \n Uncommon \n Uncommon \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue \nInfusion site pain  \n\n Uncommon \n Uncommon \n\n \nPost Marketing Experience \nIn post-marketing experience, FIX inhibitor development and hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) have \nbeen observed. \n \nPaediatric population  \nFrequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar as in adults. For \nextent and age characterisation of the safety database in children see section 5.1. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows \ncontinued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked \nto report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nThe effects of higher than recommended doses of ALPROLIX have not been characterised. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX, ATC code: B02BD04 \n \nMechanism of action \nFactor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 68,000 Dalton. It is a vitamin-K \ndependent coagulation factor. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway and \nby the factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway. Activated factor IX, in combination with \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n8 \n\nactivated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin \nthen converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is formed. Haemophilia B is an X-linked hereditary disorder of \nblood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal \norgans, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the \nplasma level of factor IX is increased thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and \ncorrection of the bleeding tendencies.  \n \nALPROLIX (eftrenonacog alfa) is a long-acting, fully recombinant, fusion protein comprising human \ncoagulation factor IX covalently linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, and produced by \nrecombinant DNA technology.  \n \nThe Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 binds with the neonatal Fc receptor. This receptor is expressed \nthroughout life as part of a naturally occurring pathway that protects immunoglobulins from lysosomal \ndegradation by cycling these proteins back into circulation, resulting in their long plasma half-life. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ALPROLIX were evaluated in 2 multinational, open-label, \npivotal studies; a phase 3 study in adults and adolescents, referred to as study I and a phase 3 paediatric \nstudy, referred to as study II (see Paediatric population).  \n \nStudy I compared the efficacy of each of 2 prophylactic treatment regimens (fixed weekly interval with \ndosing of 50 IU/kg, and individualised interval with 100 IU/kg starting every 10 days) to on demand \ntreatment. The study enrolled a total of 123 previously treated male patients (12 to 71 years of age) with \nsevere haemophilia B (\u22642% endogenous FIX activity). All patients received treatment with ALPROLIX and \nwere followed for up to 77 weeks.  \n \nOut of 123 subjects who completed Study I, 93 were enrolled in Study III (extension study) with median \ntotal follow-up time of 6.5 years. \n \nProphylaxis fixed weekly and individualised intervals:  \nMedian weekly dose for subjects in the fixed weekly arm was 45.17 IU/kg (interquartile range (IQR) 38.1-\n53.7) in Study I. The corresponding median Annualised Bleeding Rates (ABR) in subjects evaluable for \nefficacy were 2.95 (IQR: 1.01-4.35) and remained similar throughout Study III (1.85 (IQR: 0.76-4.0)). \nSubjects had a median of 0.38 (IQR: 0.00-1.43) spontaneous joint bleeds in Study III. \n \nFor subjects in the individualised interval arm, the median dosing interval was 12.53 days (IQR: 10.4-13.4) \nin Study I. The corresponding median ABR was 1.38 (IQR: 0.00-3.43) and remained similar throughout \nStudy III (1.85 (IQR: 0.76-4.0)).  \nDosing intervals and factor consumption remained similar in Study III (extension study) compared to Study I \nfor both prophylactic regimens.  \n \nNo bleeding episodes were experienced in 42% of subjects while on individualised prophylaxis and in 23% \nof subjects while on weekly prophylaxis. There was a lower proportion of subjects in individualised interval \nprophylaxis with \u22651 target joint at baseline than in weekly prophylaxis (27.6% and 57.1%, respectively). \nOf note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical studies. \n \nTreatment of bleeding: Of the 636 bleeding events observed during study I, 90.4 % were controlled with \n1 injection and overall 97.3% with 2 or fewer injections. The median average dose per injection to treat a \nbleeding episode was 46.07 (IQR: 32.86-57.03) IU/kg. The median overall dose to treat a bleeding episode \nwas 51.47 IU/kg (IQR: 35.21-61.73) in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 49.62 IU/kg (IQR: 35.71-94.82) in the \nindividualised interval prophylaxis arm and 46.58 IU/kg (IQR: 33. 33-59.41) in the on demand treatment \narm. \n \nPerioperative management (surgical prophylaxis): \nA total of 35 major surgical procedures were performed and assessed in 22 subjects (21 adults and \nadolescents, and 1 paediatric patient <12 years of age) in Study I and Study III. Of the 35 major surgeries, 28 \nsurgeries (80.0%) required a single pre-operative dose to maintain haemostasis during surgery. The median \n\n\n\n9 \n\naverage dose per injection to maintain hemostasis during surgery was 94.7 IU/kg (range: 49 to 152 IU/kg). \nThe total dose on the day of surgery ranged from 49 to 341 IU/kg and the total dose in the 14 day \nperioperative period ranged from 60 to 1947 IU/kg. \n \nThe haemostatic response was rated as excellent or good in 100% of major surgeries. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nStudy II enrolled a total of 30 previously treated male paediatric patients with severe hemophilia B (\u22642% \nendogenous FIX activity). Patients were less than 12 years of age (15 were <6 years of age and 15 were 6 to \n<12 years of age). All patients received treatment with ALPROLIX and were followed for up to 52 weeks. \n \nAll of the 30 patients were treated with ALPROLIX on a prophylactic dosing regimen starting with \n50-60 IU/kg every 7 days, with adjustment of dose to a maximum of 100 IU/kg and dosing interval to a \nminimum of once weekly and a maximum of twice weekly. Out of 30 patients having completed Study II, 27 \nenrolled to Study III (extension study). The median time on Study II+III was 2.88 years and median number \nof exposure days was 166. \n \nProphylaxis Individualised Regimen:  \nThe median average weekly dose of ALPROLIX was 59.40 IU/kg (interquartile range, 52.95 to 64.78 IU/kg) \nfor subjects <6 years of age and 57.78 IU/kg (interquartile range, 51.67 to 65.01 IU/kg) for subjects 6 to \n<12 years of age. The median dosing interval overall was 6.99 day (interquartile range, 6.94 to 7.03) with no \ndifference in the median dosing interval between age cohorts. With the exception of one patient whose last \nprescribed dose was 100 IU/kg every 5 days, the other 29 patients last prescribed doses were up to 70 IU/kg \nevery 7 days. No bleeding episodes were experienced in 33% of paediatric subjects. Dosing intervals and \nfactor consumption remained similar in Study III compared to Study II. \n \nMedian annualised bleeding rates in subjects <12 years of age evaluable for efficacy were 1.97 (interquartile \nrange 0.00-3.13) in Study II and remained similar throughout Study III (extension study). \n \nTreatment of bleeding episodes: Of the 60 bleeding events observed during study II, 75% were controlled \nwith 1 injection, and overall 91.7% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 2 or fewer injections. The \nmedian average dose per injection to treat a bleeding episode was 63.51 (interquartile range, 48.92-\n99.44) IU/kg. The median overall dose to treat a bleeding episode was 68.22 IU/kg (interquartile range, \n50.89-126.19). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nAll pharmacokinetic studies with ALPROLIX were conducted in previously treated patients with severe \nhaemophilia B. Data presented in this section were obtained by one-stage clotting assay with a silica-based \naPTT reagent calibrated against factor IX plasma standards.  \n \nPharmacokinetic properties were evaluated in 22 subjects (\u226519 years) receiving ALPROLIX (rFIXFc). \nFollowing a washout period of at least 120 hours (5 days), the subjects received a single dose of 50 IU/kg of \nALPROLIX. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected pre-dose and then subsequently at 11 time points up to \n240 hours (10 days) post-dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the non-compartmental analysis after \n50 IU/kg dose of ALPROLIX are presented in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters of ALPROLIX (50 IU/kg dose) \n\nPharmacokinetic parameters1 \nALPROLIX  \n\n(95% CI) \nN=22 \n\nIncremental Recovery (IU/dL per IU/kg) 0.92 (0.77-1.10) \nAUC/Dose \n\n(IU*h/dL per IU/kg) \n31.58 \n\n(28.46-35.05) \n\nCmax (IU/dL) \n46.10 \n\n(38.56-55.11) \n\n\n\n10 \n\nCL (mL/h/kg) 3.17 (2.85-3.51) \n\nt\u00bd (h) \n77.60 \n\n(70.05-85.95) \n\nt\u00bd\u03b1 (h)2 \n5.03 \n\n(3.20-7.89) \n\nt\u00bd\u03b2 (h)2 \n82.12 \n\n(71.39-94.46) \n\nMRT (h) 95.82 (88.44-106.21) \n\nVss (mL/kg) \n303.4 \n\n(275.1-334.6) \n\nTime to 1% (days)2 11.22  (10.20-12.35) \n1 Pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Geometric Mean (95% CI)  \n2 These pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the compartmental analysis \nAbbreviations: CI = confidence interval; Cmax= maximum activity; AUC = area under the FIX activity time curve; t1/2 = terminal half-life; t\u00bd\u03b1 = \ndistribution half-life; t\u00bd\u03b2 = elimination half-life; CL = clearance; Vss = volume of distribution at steady-state; MRT = mean residence time. \n \nThe elimination half-life of ALPROLIX (82 hours) is influenced by the Fc region, which in animal models \nwas shown to be mediated by neonatal Fc receptor cycling pathways. \n \nA population pharmacokinetic model was developed based on FIX activity data from 161 subjects of all ages \n(2-76 years of age) weighing between 12.5 kg to 186.7 kg in three clinical studies (12 subjects in a phase \n1/2a study, 123 subjects in study I and 26 subjects in study II).

Instructions for preparation and administration  \n \n \n1. What ALPROLIX is and what it is used for \n \nALPROLIX contains the active substance eftrenonacog alfa, recombinant coagulation factor IX, Fc fusion \nprotein. Factor IX is a protein produced naturally in the body necessary for the blood to form clots and stop \nbleeding. \n \nALPROLIX is a medicine used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in all age groups of patients \nwith haemophilia B (inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor IX deficiency). \n \nALPROLIX is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived \ncomponents in the manufacturing process.  \n \nHow ALPROLIX works \nIn patients with haemophilia B, factor IX is missing or not working properly. ALPROLIX is used to replace \nthe missing or deficient factor IX. ALPROLIX increases factor IX level in the blood and temporarily corrects \nthe bleeding tendency. The Fc fusion protein in ALPROLIX increases the length of time that the medicine \nworks. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use ALPROLIX  \n \nDo not use ALPROLIX: \n\u2022 if you are allergic to eftrenonacog alfa or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ALPROLIX. \n \n\u2022 There is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic \n\nreaction) to ALPROLIX. Signs of allergic reactions may include, generalised itching, hives, tightness \nof the chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If any of these symptoms occur, stop the \ninjection immediately and contact your doctor. \n\n \n\u2022 Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding is not being controlled with the dose you receive, as \n\nthere can be several reasons for this. For example, the formation of antibodies (also known as \ninhibitors) to factor IX is a known complication that can occur during the treatment of haemophilia B. \nThe antibodies prevent the treatment from working properly. This would be checked by your doctor. \nDo not increase the total dose of ALPROLIX to control your bleed without talking to your doctor.  \n\n \nPatients with a factor IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with \nfactor IX. Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as those described above, you should be tested \nfor the presence of an inhibitor.  \n \nFactor IX products may increase the risk of unwanted blood clots in your body, especially if you have risk \nfactors for developing blood clots. Symptoms of a possible unwanted blood clot may include: pain and/or \ntenderness along a vein, unexpected swelling of an arm or leg or sudden shortness of breath or difficulty \nbreathing. \n \nCatheter-related complications \nIf you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including local \ninfections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter -site blood clots should be considered. \n \nDocumentation \nIt is strongly recommended that every time ALPROLIX is given, the name and batch number of the product \nare recorded. \n \nOther medicines and ALPROLIX \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines  \nALPROLIX has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \nALPROLIX contains sodium \nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial after preparation, that is to say essentially \n\u201csodium free\u201d.. \n \n \n3. How to use ALPROLIX \n \nTreatment with ALPROLIX will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with \nhaemophilia. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you (see section 7). Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. \n \nALPROLIX is given as an injection into a vein. You or somebody else may administer ALPROLIX after \nreceiving adequate training. Your doctor will decide the dose of ALPROLIX (in International Units or \u201cIU\u201d) \nyou will receive. The dose will depend on your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and on \n\n\n\n26 \n\nwhether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding \nis not being controlled with the dose you receive. \n \nHow often you need an injection will depend on how well ALPROLIX is working for you. Your doctor will \nperform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor IX levels in your blood.  \n \nTreatment of bleeding  \nThe dose of ALPROLIX is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor IX levels to be \nachieved. The target factor IX levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. \n \nPrevention of bleeding  \nIf you are using ALPROLIX to prevent bleeding, your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  \n \nThe usual dose of ALPROLIX is 50 IU per kg of body weight, given once a week or 100 IU per kg of body \nweight, given once every 10 days. The dose or interval may be adjusted by your doctor. In some cases, \nespecially in younger patients, shorter dosing intervals or higher doses may be necessary. \n \nUse in children and adolescents \nALPROLIX can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12 years, higher \ndoses or more frequent injections may be needed and the usual dose is 50 to 60 IU per kg of body weight, \ngiven once every 7 days.  \n \nIf you use more ALPROLIX than you should \nTell your doctor as soon as possible. You should always use ALPROLIX exactly as your doctor has told you, \ncheck with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  \n \nIf you forget to use ALPROLIX \nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your dose as soon as you remember and \nthen resume your normal dosing schedule. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or \nnurse.  \n \nIf you stop using ALPROLIX \nDo not stop using ALPROLIX without consulting your doctor. If you stop using ALPROLIX you may no \nlonger be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not stop. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nIf severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately. \nYou must contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms of allergic \nreactions: swelling of the face, rash, generalised itching, hives, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing, \nburning and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, headache, general feeling of being unwell, nausea, \nrestlessness, fast heartbeat, and low blood pressure. \n \nThe following side effects may occur with this medicine. \n \nCommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): headache, mouth numbness or tingling, pain in \nyour side with blood in your urine (obstructive uropathy). \n \nUncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): dizziness, taste alteration, bad breath, feeling \ntired, pain at the injection site, rapid heartbeat, blood in the urine (haematuria), pain in your side (renal \ncolic), low blood pressure, and decreased appetite. \n \n\n\n\n27 \n\nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in \nAppendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.

Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol swabs \n(F) provided in the pack, and allow to air dry. Do not \ntouch the top of the vial or allow it to touch anything \nelse once wiped.  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n5. Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the adapter \nfrom its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. \n\n \n6. Place the vial on a flat surface. Hold the vial adapter \n\nin its protective cap and place it squarely over the top \nof the vial. Press down firmly until the adapter snaps \ninto place on top of the vial, with the adapter spike \npenetrating the vial stopper. \n\n \n\n \n7. Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by \n\ninserting the tip of the plunger rod into the opening in \nthe syringe plunger. Turn the plunger rod firmly \nclockwise until it is securely seated in the syringe \nplunger. \n\n \n\n \n\n8. Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap from \nthe solvent syringe by bending at the perforation cap \nuntil it snaps off. Set the cap aside by placing it with \nthe top down on a flat surface. Do not touch the inside \nof the cap or the syringe tip. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n9. Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and \ndiscard. \n\n \n\n \n\n10.  Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by \ninserting the tip of the syringe into the adapter \nopening. Firmly push and turn the syringe clockwise \nuntil it is securely connected. \n\n \n\n11. Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent \ninto the ALPROLIX vial. \n\n \n\n12. With the syringe still connected to the adapter and the \nplunger rod pressed down, gently swirl the vial until \nthe powder is dissolved.  \n\n Do not shake. \n\n \n\n13. The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear clear \nto slightly opalescent and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains visible particles. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n14. Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully \npressed down, invert the vial. Slowly pull on the \nplunger rod to draw back all the solution through the \nvial adapter into the syringe. \n\n \n\n \n\n15. Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently \npulling and turning the vial counterclockwise. \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: If you use more than one vial of ALPROLIX per injection, each vial should be prepared separately as \nper the previous instructions (steps 1 to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the vial \nadapter in place. A single large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the prepared contents of each of \nthe individual vials. \n \n16. Discard the vial and the adapter. \n \nNote: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the \nsyringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. \n \nAfter preparation, ALPROLIX can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. \nAfter this time, the prepared ALPROLIX should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. \n \n \nAdministration (Intravenous Injection): \n \nALPROLIX should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. \n \n1. Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of the \n\ntubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ALPROLIX solution \nto the end of the infusion set tubing by turning clockwise. \n\n \n\n\n\n32 \n\n2. If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the other \nalcohol swab provided in the pack. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3. Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid has \n\nreached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the clear plastic \nprotective cover from the needle. \n\n \n4. Insert the infusion set needle into a vein as instructed by your doctor or nurse and remove the \n\ntourniquet. If preferred, you may use one of the plasters (G) provided in the pack to hold the plastic \nwings of the needle in place at the injection site. The prepared product should be injected \nintravenously over several minutes. Your doctor may change your recommended injection rate to make \nit more comfortable for you. \n\n \n5. After completing the injection and removing the needle, you should \n\nfold over the needle protector and snap it over the needle. \n\n \n6. Please safely dispose of the used needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty vial in an \n\nappropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly. Do \nnot reuse equipment. \n \n\n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA. MANUFACTURER(S) OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND MANUFACTURER(S) RESPONSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE\n\tB.

you need to know before you use alprolix", "Section_Content": "do not use alprolix: if you are allergic to eftrenonacog alfa or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). warnings and precautions talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using alprolix. there is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) to alprolix. signs of allergic reactions may include, generalised itching, hives, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. if any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding is not being controlled with the dose you receive, as there can be several reasons for this. for example, the formation of antibodies (also known as inhibitors) to factor ix is a known complication that can occur during the treatment of haemophilia b. the antibodies prevent the treatment from working properly. this would be checked by your doctor. do not increase the total dose of alprolix to control your bleed without talking to your doctor. patients with a factor ix inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with factor ix. therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as those described above, you should be tested for the presence of an inhibitor. factor ix products may increase the risk of unwanted blood clots in your body, especially if you have risk factors for developing blood clots. symptoms of a possible unwanted blood clot may include: pain and/or tenderness along a vein, unexpected swelling of an arm or leg or sudden shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. catheter-related complications if you require a central venous access device (cvad), risk of cvad-related complications including local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter -site blood clots should be considered. documentation it is strongly recommended that every time alprolix is given, the name and batch number of the product are recorded. other medicines and alprolix tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used
