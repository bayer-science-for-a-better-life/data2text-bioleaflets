NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph 100 mg hard capsules \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach capsule contains 100 mg miglustat \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nHard capsule. \n \nWhite opaque cap and body, hard gelatin capsules size 4 of about 14.0 mm length. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph is indicated for the oral treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 \nGaucher disease. Miglustat Gen.Orph may be used only in the treatment of patients for whom enzyme \nreplacement therapy is unsuitable (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph is indicated for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult \npatients and paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease (see sections 4.4, and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nTherapy should be directed by physicians who are knowledgeable in the management of Gaucher \ndisease or Niemann-Pick type C disease, as appropriate. \n \nPosology \n \nDosage in type 1 Gaucher disease \n \nAdult \nThe recommended starting dose for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is \n100 mg three times a day. \n \nTemporary dose reduction to 100 mg once or twice a day may be necessary in some patients because \nof diarrhoea. \n \nPaediatric population \nThe efficacy of Miglustat Gen.Orph in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years with type 1 Gaucher \ndisease has not been established. No data are available. \n \nDosage in Niemann-Pick type C disease \n \nAdult \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of adult patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease is 200 \nmg three times a day. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nPaediatric population \nThe recommended dose for the treatment of adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease is 200 mg three times a day. \n \nDosing in patients under the age of 12 years should be adjusted on the basis of body surface area as \nillustrated below: \n \n\nBody surface area (m²) Recommended dose \n> 1.25 200 mg three times a day \n> 0.88 – 1.25 200 mg twice a day \n> 0.73 – 0.88 100 mg three times a day \n> 0.47 – 0.73 100 mg twice a day \n≤ 0.47 100 mg once a day \n\n \nTemporary dose reduction may be necessary in some patients because of diarrhoea. \n \nThe benefit to the patient of treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph should be evaluated on a regular basis \n(see section 4.4). \n \nThere is limited experience with the use of Miglustat Gen.Orph in Niemann-Pick type C disease \npatients under the age of 4 years. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nElderly \nThere is no experience with the use of Miglustat Gen.Orph in patients over the age of 70. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetic data indicate increased systemic exposure to miglustat in patients with renal \nimpairment. In patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 50–70 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration \nshould commence at a dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a \ndose of 200 mg twice daily (adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients \nwith Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nIn patients with an adjusted creatinine clearance of 30–50 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration should \ncommence at a dose of 100 mg once daily in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and at a dose of \n100 mg twice daily (adjusted for body surface area in patients below the age of 12) in patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease. Use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance \n< 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment \nMiglustat Gen.Orph has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. \n \nMethod of administration  \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph can be taken with or without food. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTremor \nApproximately 37% of patients in clinical trials in type 1 Gaucher disease, and 58% of patients in a \nclinical trial in Niemann-Pick type C disease reported tremor on treatment. In type 1 Gaucher disease, \nthese tremors were described as an exaggerated physiological tremor of the hands. Tremor usually \n\n\n\n4 \n\nbegan within the first month, and in many cases resolved during treatment after between 1 and 3 \nmonths. Dose reduction may ameliorate the tremor, usually within days, but discontinuation of \ntreatment may sometimes be required. \n \nGastrointestinal disturbances \nGastrointestinal events, mainly diarrhoea, have been observed in more than 80% of patients, either at \nthe outset of treatment or intermittently during treatment (see section 4.8). The mechanism is most \nlikely inhibition of intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase-isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract \nleading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides. In clinical practice, miglustat-induced \ngastrointestinal events have been observed to respond to individualised diet modification (for example \nreduction of sucrose, lactose and other carbohydrate intake), to taking miglustat between meals, and/or \nto anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products such as loperamide. In some patients, temporary dose reduction \nmay be necessary. Patients with chronic diarrhoea or other persistent gastrointestinal events that do not \nrespond to these interventions should be investigated according to clinical practice. Miglustat has not \nbeen evaluated in patients with a history of significant gastrointestinal disease, including inflammatory \nbowel disease. \n \nEffects on spermatogenesis \nMale patients should maintain reliable contraceptive methods while taking Miglustat Gen.Orph. \nStudies in the rat have shown that miglustat adversely affects spermatogenesis and sperm parameters, \nand reduces fertility (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). Until further information is available, before seeking to \nconceive, male patients should cease Miglustat Gen.Orph and maintain reliable contraceptive methods \nfor a further 3 months. \n \nSpecial populations \nDue to limited experience, Miglustat Gen.Orph should be used with caution in patients with renal or \nhepatic impairment. There is a close relationship between renal function and clearance of miglustat, \nand exposure to miglustat is markedly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (see section \n5.2). At present, there is insufficient clinical experience in these patients to provide dosing \nrecommendations. Use of Miglustat Gen.Orph in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is not recommended. \n \nType 1 Gaucher disease \n \nAlthough no direct comparisons with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) have been performed in \ntreatment-naive patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, there is no evidence of miglustat having an \nefficacy or safety advantage over ERT. ERT is the standard of care for patients who require treatment \nfor type 1 Gaucher disease (see section 5.1). The efficacy and safety of miglustat has not been \nspecifically evaluated in patients with severe Gaucher disease. \n \nRegular monitoring of vitamin B12 level is recommended because of the high prevalence of vitamin \nB12 deficiency in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. \n \nCases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with miglustat with or without \nconcurrent conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency and monoclonal gammopathy. Peripheral \nneuropathy seems to be more common in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease compared to the \ngeneral population. All patients should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluation. \n \nIn patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, monitoring of platelet counts is recommended. Mild \nreductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in patients with type 1 \nGaucher disease who were switched from ERT to miglustat. \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease \n \nThe benefit of treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph for neurological manifestations in patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months; continuation \nof therapy should be re-appraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \nMild reductions in platelet counts without association to bleeding were observed in some patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease treated with miglustat. In patients included in the clinical trial, 40%-50% \nof patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of normal at baseline. Monitoring of platelet \ncounts is recommended in these patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nReduced growth has been reported in some paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease in \nthe early phase of treatment with miglustat where the initial reduced weight gain may be accompanied \nor followed by reduced height gain. Growth should be monitored in paediatric and adolescent patients \nduring treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph; the benefit/risk balance should be re-assessed on an \nindividual basis for continuation of therapy. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nLimited data suggest that co-administration of miglustat and enzyme replacement with imiglucerase in \npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease may result in decreased exposure to miglustat (approximate \nreductions of 22% in Cmax and 14% in AUC were observed in a small parallel-group study). This \nstudy also indicated that miglustat has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of imiglucerase. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no adequate data from the use of miglustat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have \nshown reproductive toxicity, including dystocia (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is \nunknown. Miglustat crosses the placenta and should not be used during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known if miglustat is secreted in breast milk. Miglustat Gen.Orph should not be taken during \nbreast-feeding. \n \nFertility \nStudies in the rat have shown that miglustat adversely affects sperm parameters (motility and \nmorphology) thereby reducing fertility (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Until further information is \navailable, it is advised that before seeking to conceive, male patients should cease Miglustat Gen.Orph \nand maintain reliable contraceptive methods for 3 months thereafter. \n \nContraceptive measures should be used by women of childbearing potential. Male patients should \nmaintain reliable contraceptive methods while taking Miglustat Gen.Orph (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has \nbeen reported as a common adverse reaction, and patients suffering from dizziness should not drive or \nuse machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \n \nThe most common adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with miglustat were diarrhoea, \nflatulence, abdominal pain, weight loss and tremor (see section 4.4). The most common serious \nadverse reaction reported with miglustat treatment in clinical studies was peripheral neuropathy (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nIn 11 clinical trials in different indications 247 patients were treated with miglustat at dosages of 50-\n200 mg t.i.d. for an average duration of 2.1 years. Of these patients, 132 had type 1 Gaucher disease, \nand 40 had Niemann-Pick type C disease. Adverse reactions were generally of mild to moderate \nseverity and occurred with similar frequency across indications and dosages tested. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n \nAdverse reactions from clinical trials and spontaneous reporting, occurring in >1% of patients, are \nlisted in the table below by system organ class and frequency (very common: ≥ 1/10, common: \n≥ 1/100 < 1/10, uncommon: ≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100, rare: ≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000, very rare: <1/10,000). \nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon  Thrombocytopenia \n \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nVery common  Weight loss, decreased appetite \n \nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon  Depression, insomnia, libido decreased \n \nNervous system disorders \nVery common  Tremor, \nCommon  Peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, amnesia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, \n\nheadache, dizziness \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \nVery common  Diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal pain \nCommon  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension/discomfort, constipation, \n\ndyspepsia \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \nCommon  Muscle spasms, muscle weakness \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site reactions \nCommon  Fatigue, asthenia, chills and malaise \n \nInvestigations \nCommon  Nerve conduction studies abnormal \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nWeight loss has been reported in 55% of patients. The greatest prevalence was observed between 6 \nand 12 months. \n \nMiglustat has been studied in indications where certain events reported as adverse reactions, such as \nneurological and neuropsychological symptoms/signs, cognitive dysfunction and thrombocytopenia \ncould also be due to the underlying conditions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nSymptoms \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n7 \n\nNo acute symptoms of overdose have been identified. Miglustat has been administered at doses of up \nto 3000 mg/day for up to six months in HIV positive patients during clinical trials. Adverse events \nobserved included granulocytopenia, dizziness and paraesthesia. Leukopenia and neutropenia have \nalso been observed in a similar group of patients receiving 800 mg/day or higher dose. \n \nManagement \nIn case of overdose general medical care is recommended. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC Code: A16AX06 \n \nType 1 Gaucher disease \n \nGaucher disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a failure to degrade glucosylceramide \nresulting in lysosomal storage of this material and widespread pathology. Miglustat is an inhibitor of \nglucosylceramide synthase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in the synthesis of most \nglycolipids. In vitro, glucosylceramide synthase is inhibited by miglustat with an IC50 of 20-37 μM. In \naddition, inhibitory action on a non-lysosomal glycosylceramidase has been demonstrated \nexperimentally in vitro. The inhibitory action on glucosylceramide synthase forms the rationale for \nsubstrate reduction therapy in Gaucher disease. \n \nThe pivotal trial of miglustat was conducted in patients unable or unwilling to receive ERT. Reasons \nfor not receiving ERT included the burden of intravenous infusions and difficulties in venous access. \nTwenty-eight patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease were enrolled in this 12-month \nnon-comparative study, and 22 patients completed the study. At 12 months, there was a mean \nreduction in liver organ volume of 12.1% and a mean reduction in spleen volume of 19.0%. A mean \nincrease in haemoglobin concentration of 0.26 g/dl and a mean platelet count increase of 8.29 × 109/l \nwere observed. Eighteen patients then continued to receive miglustat under an optional extended \ntreatment protocol. Clinical benefit has been assessed at 24 and 36 months in 13 patients. After 3 years \nof continuous miglustat treatment, mean reductions in liver and spleen organ volume were 17.5% and \n29.6%, respectively. There was a mean increase of 22.2 × 109/l in platelet count, and a mean increase \nof 0.95 g/dl in haemoglobin concentration. \n \nA second open, controlled study randomised 36 patients who had received a minimum of 2 years of \ntreatment with ERT, into three treatment groups: continuation with imiglucerase, imiglucerase in \ncombination with miglustat, or switch to miglustat. This study was conducted over a 6-month \nrandomised comparison period followed by 18 months extension where all patients received miglustat \nmonotherapy. In the first 6 months in patients who were switched to miglustat, liver and spleen organ \nvolumes and haemoglobin levels were unchanged. In some patients there were reductions in platelet \ncount and increases in chitotriosidase activity indicating that miglustat monotherapy may not maintain \nthe same control of disease activity in all patients. 29 patients continued in the extension period. When \ncompared to the measurements at 6 months, disease control was unchanged after 18 and 24 months of \nmiglustat monotherapy (20 and 6 patients, respectively). No patient showed rapid deterioration of type \n1 Gaucher disease following the switch to miglustat monotherapy. \n \nA total daily dose of 300 mg miglustat administered in three divided doses was used in the above two \nstudies. An additional monotherapy study was performed in 18 patients at a total daily dose of 150 mg, \nand results indicate reduced efficacy compared to a total daily dose of 300 mg. \n \nAn open-label, non comparative, 2-year study enrolled 42 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, who \nhad received a minimum of 3 years of ERT and who fulfilled criteria of stable disease for at least \n2 years. The patients were switched to monotherapy with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. Liver volume \n(primary efficacy variable) was unchanged from baseline to the end of treatment. Six patients had \n\n\n\n8 \n\nmiglustat treatment prematurely discontinued for potential disease worsening, as defined in the study. \nThirteen patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Small mean reductions in \nhaemoglobin [–0.95 g/dL (95% CI: –1.38, –0.53)] and platelet count [-44.1 × 109/L (95% CI: –57.6, –\n30.7)] were observed between baseline and end of study. Twenty-one patients completed 24 months of \nmiglustat treatment. Of these, 18 patients at baseline were within established therapeutic goals for liver \nand spleen volume, haemoglobin levels, and platelet counts, and 16 patients remained within all these \ntherapeutic goals at Month 24. \n \nBone manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease were evaluated in 3 open-label clinical studies in \npatients treated with miglustat 100 mg t.i.d. for up to 2 years (n = 72). In a pooled analysis of \nuncontrolled data, bone mineral density Z-scores at the lumbar spine and femoral neck increased by \nmore than 0.1 units from baseline in 27 (57%) and 28 (65%) of the patients with longitudinal bone \ndensity measurements. There were no events of bone crisis, avascular necrosis or fracture during the \ntreatment period. \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease \n \nNiemann-Pick type C disease is a very rare, invariably progressive and eventually fatal \nneurodegenerative disorder characterised by impaired intracellular lipid trafficking. The neurological \nmanifestations are considered secondary to the abnormal accumulation of glycosphingolipids in \nneuronal and glial cells. \n \nData to support safety and efficacy of miglustat in Niemann-Pick type C disease come from a \nprospective open-label clinical trial and a retrospective survey. The clinical trial included 29 adult and \njuvenile patients in a 12-month controlled period, followed by extension therapy for an average total \nduration of 3.9 years and up to 5.6 years. In addition 12 paediatric patients were enrolled in an \nuncontrolled substudy for an overall average duration of 3.1 years and up to 4.4 years. Among the 41 \npatients enrolled in the trial 14 patients were treated with miglustat for more than 3 years. The survey \nincluded a case series of 66 patients treated with miglustat outside of the clinical trial for a mean \nduration of 1.5 years. Both data sets included paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with an age \nrange of 1 year to 43 years. The usual dose of miglustat in adult patients was 200 mg t.i.d., and was \nadjusted according to body surface area in paediatric patients. \n \nOverall the data show that treatment with miglustat can reduce the progression of clinically relevant \nneurological symptoms in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nThe benefit of treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph for neurological manifestations in patients with \nNiemann-Pick type C disease should be evaluated on a regular basis, e.g. every 6 months; continuation \nof therapy should be re-appraised after at least 1 year of treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph, (see \nsection 4.4). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters of miglustat were assessed in healthy subjects, in a small number of \npatients with type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, HIV-infected patients, and in adults, adolescents \nand children with Niemann-Pick type C disease or type 3 Gaucher disease. \n \nThe kinetics of miglustat appear to be dose linear and time independent. In healthy subjects miglustat \nis rapidly absorbed. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached about 2 hours after dose. Absolute \nbioavailability has not been determined. Concomitant administration of food decreases the rate of \nabsorption (Cmax was decreased by 36% and tmax delayed 2 hours), but has no statistically significant \neffect on the extent of absorption of miglustat (AUC decreased by 14%). \n \nThe apparent volume of distribution of miglustat is 83 l. Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins. \nMiglustat is mainly eliminated by renal excretion, with urinary recovery of unchanged drug \naccounting for 70-80% of the dose. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is 230 ± 39 ml/min. The average \nhalf-life is 6–7 hours. \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \nFollowing administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14C-miglustat to healthy volunteers, 83% of the \nradioactivity was recovered in urine and 12% in faeces. Several metabolites were identified in urine \nand faeces. The most abundant metabolite in urine was miglustat glucuronide accounting for 5% of the \ndose. The terminal half-life of radioactivity in plasma was 150 h suggesting the presence of one or \nmore metabolites with very long half-life. The metabolite accounting for this has not been identified, \nbut may accumulate and reach concentrations exceeding those of miglustat at steady state. \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of miglustat is similar in adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients and Niemann-\nPick type C disease patients when compared to healthy subjects. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nPharmacokinetic data were obtained in paediatric patients with type 3 Gaucher disease aged 3 to 15 \nyears, and patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease aged 5–16 years. Dosing in children at 200 mg \nt.i.d. adjusted for body surface area resulted in Cmax and AUCτ values which were approximately \ntwofold those attained after 100 mg t.i.d. in type 1 Gaucher disease patients, consistent with the dose-\nlinear pharmacokinetics of miglustat. At steady state, the concentration of miglustat in cerebrospinal \nfluid of six type 3 Gaucher disease patients was 31.4–67.2% of that in plasma. \n \nLimited data in patients with Fabry disease and impaired renal function showed that CL/F decreases \nwith decreasing renal function. While the numbers of subjects with mild and moderate renal \nimpairment were very small, the data suggest an approximate decrease in CL/F of 40% and 60% \nrespectively, in mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). Data in severe renal impairment \nare limited to two patients with creatinine clearance in the range 18 – 29 ml/min and cannot be \nextrapolated below this range. These data suggest a decrease in CL/F by at least 70% in patients with \nsevere renal impairment. \n \nOver the range of data available, no significant relationships or trends were noted between miglustat \npharmacokinetic parameters and demographic variables (age, BMI, gender or race). \n \nThere are no pharmacokinetic data available in patients with liver impairment or in the elderly \n(> 70 years). \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nThe main effects common to all species were weight loss and diarrhoea, and, at higher doses, damage \nto the gastrointestinal mucosa (erosions and ulceration). Further effects seen in animals at doses that \nresult in exposure levels similar to or moderately higher than the clinical exposure level were: changes \nin lymphoid organs in all species tested, transaminase changes, vacuolation of thyroid and pancreas, \ncataracts, nephropathy and myocardial changes in rats. These findings were considered to be \nsecondary to debilitation. \n \nAdministration of miglustat to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats by oral gavage for 2 years at \ndose levels of 30, 60 and 180 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell \n(Leydig cell) hyperplasia and adenomas in male rats at all dose levels. The systemic exposure at the \nlowest dose was below or comparable to that observed in humans (based on AUC0-∞) at the \nrecommended human dose. A No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was not established and the effect \nwas not dose dependent. There was no drug-related increase in tumor incidence in male or female rats \nin any other organ. Mechanistic studies revealed a rat specific mechanism which is considered to be of \nlow relevance for humans. \n \nAdministration of miglustat to male and female CD1 mice by oral gavage at dose levels of 210, 420 \nand 840/500 mg/kg/day (dose reduction after half a year) for 2 years resulted in an increased incidence \nof inflammatory and hyperplastic lesions in the large intestine in both sexes. Based on mg/kg/day and \ncorrected for differences in faecal excretion, the doses corresponded to 8, 16 and 33/19 times the \nhighest recommended human dose (200 mg t.i.d.). Carcinomas in the large intestine occurred \n\n\n\n10 \n\noccasionally at all doses with a statistically significant increase in the high dose group. A relevance of \nthese findings to humans cannot be excluded. There was no drug-related increase in tumour incidence \nin any other organ. \n \nMiglustat did not show any potential for mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the standard battery of \ngenotoxicity tests. \n \nRepeated-dose toxicity studies in rats showed effects on the seminiferous epithelium of the testes. \nOther studies revealed changes in sperm parameters (motility and morphology) consistent with an \nobserved reduction in fertility. These effects occurred at exposure levels similar to those in patients, \nbut showed reversibility. Miglustat affected embryo/foetal survival in rats and rabbits, dystocia was \nreported, post-implantation losses were increased, and an increased incidence of vascular anomalies \noccurred in rabbits. These effects may be partly related to maternal toxicity. \n \nChanges in lactation were observed in female rats in a 1-year study. The mechanism for this effect is \nunknown. \n \n \n6.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n20 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the user \n \n\nMiglustat Gen.Orph 100 mg hard capsules \nmiglustat \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains \n\nimportant information for you. \n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours.  \n- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side \n\neffects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n \n1. What Miglustat Gen.Orph is and what it is used for  \n2.

Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Miglustat Gen.Orph is and what it is used for \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph contains the active substance miglustat which belongs to a group of medicines \nthat affect metabolism. It is used to treat two conditions: \n \n• Miglustat Gen.Orph is used to treat mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease in adults. \n \nIn type 1 Gaucher disease, a substance called glucosylceramide is not removed from your body. It \nstarts to build up in certain cells of the body’s immune system. This can result in liver and spleen \nenlargement, changes in the blood and bone disease. \n \nThe usual treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy. Miglustat Gen.Orph is \nonly used when a patient is considered unsuitable for treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. \n \n• Miglustat Gen.Orph is also used to treat progressive neurological symptoms in Niemann-\n\nPick type C disease in adults and in children. \n \nIf you have Niemann-Pick type C disease, fats such as glycosphingolipids build up in the cells of your \nbrain. This can result in disturbances in neurological functions such as slow eye movements, balance, \nswallowing, and memory, and in seizures. \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph works by inhibiting the enzyme called ‘glucosylceramide synthase’ which is \nresponsible for the first step in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you take Miglustat Gen.Orph  \n \nDo not take Miglustat Gen.Orph \n- if you are allergic to miglustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine  \n\n(listed in section 6) \n \nWarnings and precautions  \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Miglustat Gen.Orph \n\n\n\n21 \n\n- if you suffer from kidney disease \n- if you suffer from liver disease \n \nYour doctor will perform the following tests before treatment and during treatment with Miglustat \nGen.Orph: \n- an examination to check the nerves in your arms and legs \n- measurement of vitamin B12 levels \n-  monitoring growth if you are a child or adolescent with Niemann-Pick type C disease \n- monitoring of blood platelet counts \n \nThe reason for these tests is that some patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, or \na decrease in body weight, while taking Miglustat Gen.Orph. The tests will help the doctor decide \nwhether these effects are due to your disease or other existing conditions, or due to side effects of \nMiglustat Gen.Orph (see section 4 for further details). \n \nIf you have diarrhoea, your doctor may ask you to change your diet to reduce your lactose and \ncarbohydrate intake such as sucrose (cane sugar), or not to take Miglustat Gen.Orph together with \nfood, or to temporarily reduce your dose. In some cases the doctor may prescribe anti-diarrhoeal \nmedicines such as loperamide. If your diarrhoea does not respond to these measures, or if you have \nany other abdominal complaint, consult your doctor. In such case, your doctor may decide to conduct \nfurther investigations. \n \nMale patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Miglustat \nGen.Orph, and for 3  months after finishing treatment. \n \nChildren and adolescents \nDo not give this medicine to children and adolescents (below 18 years old) with type 1 Gaucher \ndisease because it is not known if it works in this disease. \n \nOther medicines and Miglustat Gen.Orph \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. \n \nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing imiglucerase, which are sometimes used at the \nsame time as Miglustat Gen.Orph. They may lower the amount of Miglustat Gen.Orph in your body. \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \nYou should  not take Miglustat Gen.Orph if you are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant. Your \ndoctor can give you more information. You must use effective birth control while taking Miglustat \nGen.Orph. Do not breastfeed while you are taking Miglustat Gen.Orph. \n \nMale patients should use reliable birth control methods during their treatment with Miglustat \nGen.Orph, and for 3 months after finishing treatment. \n \nIf you are pregnant, breast feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your \ndoctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. \n \nDriving and using machines \nMiglustat Gen.Orph may make you feel dizzy. Do not drive or use any tools or machines if you feel \ndizzy. \n \n \n3. How to take Miglustat Gen.Orph \n \nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist \nif you are not sure. \n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n• For type 1 Gaucher disease: for adults, the usual dose is one capsule (100 mg) three times a day \n(morning, afternoon and evening). This means a daily maximum of three capsules (300 mg). \n\n \n• For Niemann-Pick type C disease: For adults and adolescents (over 12 years old), the usual dose \n\nis two capsules (200 mg) three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening). This means a daily \nmaximum of six capsules (600 mg). \n\n \nFor children less than 12 years old, your doctor will adjust the dose for Niemann-Pick type C disease. \n \nIf you have a problem with your kidneys you may receive a lower starting dose. Your doctor may \nreduce your dose, e.g., to one capsule (100 mg) once or twice a day, if you suffer from diarrhoea when \ntaking Miglustat Gen.Orph (see section 4). Your doctor will tell you how long your treatment will last. \n \nMiglustat Gen.Orph can be taken with or without food. You should swallow the whole capsule with a \nglass of water. \n \nIf you take more Miglustat Gen.Orph than you should \nIf you take more capsules than you were told to, consult your doctor immediately. Miglustat has been \nused in clinical trials at doses ten times higher than the recommended dose: this caused decreases in \nwhite blood cells and other side effects similar to those described in section 4. \n \nIf you forget to take Miglustat Gen.Orph \nTake the next capsule at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop taking Miglustat Gen.Orph \nDon’t stop taking Miglustat Gen.Orph without talking to your doctor. \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nMost serious side effects: \nSome patients have had tingling or numbness in the hands and feet (seen commonly). They could \nbe signs of peripheral neuropathy, due to side effects of Miglustat Gen.Orph or they could be due to \nexisting conditions. Your doctor will perform some tests before and during treatment with Miglustat \nGen.Orph to assess this (see section 2). \n \nIf you do get any of these effects, please seek medical advice from your doctor as soon as \npossible. \n \nIf you get a slight tremor, usually trembling hands, seek medical advice from your doctor as soon \nas possible. The tremor often disappears without needing to stop the treatment. Sometimes your doctor \nwill need to reduce the dose or stop Miglustat Gen.Orph treatment to stop the tremor. \n \nVery common effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people. \nThe most common side effects are diarrhoea, flatulence (wind),  abdominal (stomach) pain, weight loss \nand decreased appetite. \n \nIf you do lose some weight when you start treatment with Miglustat Gen.Orph don’t worry. People \nusually stop losing weight as treatment goes on. \n \nCommon effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people. \nCommon side effects of treatment include headache, dizziness, paraesthesia (tingling or numbness), \nabnormal coordination, hypoaesthesia (reduced sensation to touch), dyspepsia (heartburn), nausea \n(feeling sick), constipation and vomiting, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (stomach) and \n\n\n\n23 \n\nthrombocytopenia (reduced levels of blood platelets). The neurological symptoms and \nthrombocytopenia could be due to the underlying disease. \n \nOther possible side effects are muscular spasms or weakness, fatigue, chills and malaise, depression, \ndifficulty sleeping, forgetfulness and less libido. \n \nMost patients get one or more of these side effects, usually at the start of treatment or at intervals \nduring treatment. Most cases are mild and disappear quite quickly. If any of these side effects cause \nproblems, consult your doctor. He or she may reduce the dose of Miglustat Gen.Orph or recommend \nother medicines to help control side effects. \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects \nnot listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of \nthis medicine. \n \n \n5.
