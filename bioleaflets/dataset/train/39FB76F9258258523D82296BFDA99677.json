CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nNatpar is indicated as adjunctive treatment of adult patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who \ncannot be adequately controlled with standard therapy alone. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nGeneral \nTreatment should be supervised by a physician or other qualified healthcare professional experienced \nin the management of patients with hypoparathyroidism. \n \nThe goal of treatment with Natpar is to achieve calcaemic control and to reduce symptoms (see also \nsection 4.4). The optimisation of parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism should be in line with \ncurrent therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. \n \nPrior to initiating and during treatment with Natpar: \n\n\u2022 Confirm 25-OH vitamin D stores are sufficient. \n\u2022 Confirm serum magnesium is within the reference range. \n\n \nPosology \n \nInitiating Natpar \n1. Initiate treatment with 50 micrograms once daily as a subcutaneous injection in the thigh \n\n(alternate thigh every day). If pre-dose serum calcium is >2.25 mmol/L, a starting dose of \n25 micrograms can be considered. \n\n2. In patients using active vitamin D, decrease the dose of active vitamin D by 50%, if pre-dose \nserum calcium is above 1.87 mmol/L. \n\n3. In patients using calcium supplements, maintain calcium supplement dose. \n4. Measure pre-dose serum calcium concentration within 2 to 5 days. If pre-dose serum calcium is \n\nbelow 1.87 mmol/L or above 2.55 mmol/L, this measurement should be repeated the following \nday. \n\n5. Adjust dose of active vitamin D or calcium supplement or both based on serum calcium value \nand clinical assessment (i.e., signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia). \nSuggested adjustments to Natpar, active vitamin D and calcium supplements based on serum \ncalcium levels are provided below: \n\n \n\n \n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until target pre-dose serum calcium concentration is within the range of \n\n2.0-2.25 mmol/L, active vitamin D has been discontinued and calcium supplementation is \nsufficient to meet daily requirements. \n\n \n\n Adjust first Adjust second Adjust third \nPre-dose serum \ncalcium \n\nNatpar Active vitamin D \nforms \n\nCalcium supplement \n\nAbove the upper limit \nof normal (ULN) \n(2.55 mmol/L)* \n\nConsider reducing or \nstopping Natpar and \nre-assess by means of \n\nserum calcium \nmeasurement \n\nDecrease or \ndiscontinue** Decrease \n\nGreater than \n2.25 mmol/L and \nbelow the upper limit of \nnormal (2.55 mmol/L)* \n\nConsider reduction \nDecrease or \n\ndiscontinue** \n\nNo change, or decrease \nif active vitamin D was \nalready discontinued \n\nbefore this titration step \nLess than or equal to \n2.25 mmol/L and \nabove 2 mmol/L  \n\nNo change \nNo change No change \n\nLower than 2 mmol/L \nConsider increase after \nat least 2-4 weeks at a \n\nstable dose \nIncrease Increase \n\n *The value of ULN may vary by laboratory \n**Discontinue in patients receiving the lowest available dose \n\n\n\n4 \n\nNatpar dosage adjustments after the initiation period \nSerum calcium concentration must be monitored during titration (see section 4.4). \n \nThe dose of Natpar may be increased by 25 microgram increments approximately every 2 to 4 weeks, \nup to a maximum daily dose of 100 micrograms. Downward titration to a minimum of 25 micrograms \ncan occur at any time. \n \nIt is recommended to measure the albumin-corrected serum calcium 8-12 hours after dosing Natpar. If \npost-dose serum calcium is >ULN, then first reduce active vitamin D and calcium supplements and \nmonitor progress. Measurements of pre- and post-dose serum calcium should be repeated and \nconfirmed to be within an acceptable range before titration to a higher dose of Natpar is considered. If \npost-dose serum calcium remains >ULN, oral calcium supplementation should be further reduced or \ndiscontinued (see also adjustment table under Initiating Natpar). \n \nAt any dose level of Natpar, if post-dose albumin-corrected serum calcium exceeds the ULN and all \nactive vitamin D and oral calcium have been withheld, or symptoms suggesting hypercalcaemia are \npresent, the dose of Natpar should be reduced (see section 4.4). \n \nMissed dose \nIn the case of a missed dose, Natpar must be administered as soon as reasonably feasible and \nadditional exogenous sources of calcium and/or active vitamin D must be taken based on symptoms of \nhypocalcaemia. \n \nInterruption or discontinuation of treatment \nAbrupt interruption or discontinuation of Natpar can result in severe hypocalcaemia. Temporary or \npermanent discontinuation of Natpar treatment must be accompanied by monitoring of serum calcium \nlevels and adjustment, as necessary, of exogenous calcium and/or active vitamin D (see section 4.4). \n \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nSee section 5.2. \n \nRenal impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine \nclearance 30 to 80 mL/min). There are no data available in patients with severe renal impairment (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (total score \nof 7 to 9 on the Child-Pugh scale). There are no data available in patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (see section 4.4). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of Natpar in children less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. \nNo data are available. \n \nMethod of administration \nNatpar is suitable for patient self-administration. Patients must be trained on the proper injection \ntechniques by the prescriber or nurse, in particular during initial use. \n \nEach dose must be administered as a subcutaneous injection once a day in alternating thighs. \n \nFor instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration and for using the pen \ninjector, see section 6.6 and the instructions included with the package leaflet. \n \nNatpar must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.3 Contraindications \n \nNatpar is contraindicated in patients: \n- with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 \n- who are receiving or who have previously received radiation therapy to the skeleton \n- with skeletal malignancies or bone metastases \n- who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma such as patients with Paget\u2019s disease of bone \n\nor hereditary disorders \n- with unexplained elevations of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase \n- with pseudohypoparathyroidism. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of \nthe administered product should be clearly recorded. \n \nThe aim of treatment with Natpar is to achieve a pre-dose serum calcium concentration of \n2.0-2.25 mmol/L and an 8-12 hour post-dose serum calcium concentration <2.55 mmol/L. \n \nMonitoring of patients during treatment \nPre-dose and in some cases post-dose serum calcium levels must be monitored during treatment with \nNatpar (see section 4.2). In a multi-centre clinical trial, albumin-corrected serum calcium (ACSC) \nvalues 6-10 hours post-dose were on average 0.25 mmol/L higher than the pre-dose values, with a \nmaximum increase observed of 0.7 mmol/L. Calcium, vitamin D, or Natpar doses may need to be \nreduced if post-dose hypercalcaemia is observed, even if pre-dose calcium concentrations are \nacceptable (see section 4.2). \n \nHypercalcaemia \nHypercalcaemia was reported in clinical trials with Natpar. Hypercalcaemia commonly occurred \nduring the titration period, during which doses of oral calcium, active vitamin D, and Natpar were \nbeing adjusted. Hypercalcaemia may be minimised by following the recommended dosing, the \nmonitoring information, and asking patients about any symptoms of hypercalcaemia. If severe \nhypercalcaemia (>3.0 mmol/L or above upper limit of normal with symptoms) develops, hydration \nand temporarily stopping Natpar, calcium and active vitamin D should be considered until serum \ncalcium returns to the normal range. Then consider resuming Natpar, calcium and active vitamin D at \nlower doses (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \n \nHypocalcaemia \nHypocalcaemia, a common clinical manifestation of hypoparathyroidism, was reported in clinical \ntrials with Natpar. Most of the hypocalcaemic events occurring in the clinical trials were mild to \nmoderate in severity. In the post-marketing setting, cases of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, including \ncases that resulted in seizures, have been reported in patients being treated with Natpar. The risk for \nserious hypocalcaemia is highest after Natpar is withheld, missed or abruptly discontinued, but can \noccur at any time. Temporary or permanent discontinuation of Natpar must be accompanied by \nmonitoring of serum calcium levels and increase of exogenous calcium and/or active vitamin D \nsources as necessary. Hypocalcaemia may be minimised by following the recommended dosing, the \nmonitoring information, and asking patients about any symptoms of hypocalcaemia (see sections 4.2 \nand 4.8). \n \nConcomitant use with cardiac glycosides \nHypercalcaemia of any cause may predispose to digitalis toxicity. In patients using Natpar \nconcomitantly with cardiac glycosides (such as digoxin or digitoxin), monitor serum calcium and \ncardiac glycoside levels and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity (see section 4.5). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nSevere renal or hepatic disease \nNatpar should be used with caution in patients with severe renal or hepatic disease because they have \nnot been evaluated in clinical trials. \n \nUse in young adults \nNatpar should be used with caution in young adult patients with open epiphyses as these patients may \nbe at increased risk for osteosarcoma (see section 4.3). \n \nUse in elderly patients \nClinical studies of Natpar did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine \nwhether response in these subjects is different from younger subjects. \n \nTachyphylaxis \nThe calcium-raising effect of Natpar may diminish over time in some patients. The response of serum \ncalcium concentration to administration of Natpar should be monitored at intervals to detect this and \nthe diagnosis of tachyphylaxis considered. \n \nIf serum concentration of 25-OH vitamin D is low then appropriate supplementation may restore \nserum calcium response to Natpar (see section 4.2). \n \nUrolithiasis \nNatpar has not been studied in patients with urolithiasis. Natpar should be used with caution in \npatients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this condition. \n \nHypersensitivity \nThere have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking Natpar. \nHypersensitivity reactions can include anaphylaxis, dyspnoea, angioedema, urticaria, rash, etc. If signs \nor symptoms of a serious hypersensitivity reaction occur, treatment with Natpar should be \ndiscontinued and hypersensitivity reaction should be treated according to the standard of care. Patients \nshould be monitored until signs and symptoms resolve (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). If Natpar is to be \ndiscontinued, monitoring for hypocalcaemia is necessary (see section 4.2). \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe inotropic effects of cardiac glycosides are affected by serum calcium levels. Combined use of \nNatpar and cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin or digitoxin) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity \nif hypercalcaemia develops. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with cardiac \nglycosides and Natpar (see section 4.4). \n \nFor any drug that affects serum calcium levels (e.g., lithium, thiazides), patients\u2019 serum calcium levels \nshould be monitored. \n \nCo-administration of alendronic acid and Natpar may lead to a reduction in the calcium sparing effect, \nwhich can interfere with the normalisation of serum calcium. Concomitant use of Natpar with \nbisphosphonates is not recommended. \n \nNatpar is a protein that is not metabolised by and does not inhibit hepatic microsomal \ndrug-metabolising enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 isoenzymes). Natpar is not protein bound and has \na low volume of distribution. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere are no data from the use of Natpar in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). \n \n\n\n\n7 \n\nA risk to the pregnant woman or developing foetus cannot be excluded. A decision must be made \nwhether to initiate or discontinue treatment with Natpar during pregnancy taking into account the \nknown risks of therapy versus the benefit for the woman. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is unknown whether Natpar is excreted in human milk. \n \nAvailable pharmacology data in animals have shown excretion of Natpar in milk (see section 5.3). \n \nA risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \nbreast-feeding or to discontinue therapy with Natpar, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding \nfor the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \nThere are no data on the effects of Natpar on human fertility. Animal data do not indicate any \nimpairment of fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNatpar has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Since neurologic \nsymptoms may be a sign of uncontrolled hypoparathyroidism, patients with disturbances in cognition \nor attention should be advised to refrain from driving or using machines until symptoms have \nsubsided. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile \nThe most frequent adverse reactions among patients treated with Natpar were hypercalcaemia, \nhypocalcaemia, and their associated clinical manifestations including headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, \nparaesthesia, hypoaesthesia and hypercalciuria. In the clinical studies, these reactions were generally \nmild to moderate in severity and transient, and were managed with adjustments of Natpar, calcium \nand/or active vitamin D doses (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \nAdverse reactions for Natpar-treated patients in the placebo-controlled study and in post-marketing \nexperience are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as \nvery common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), and not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data). All adverse reactions identified in post-marketing experience are italicised. \n \nSystem organ class Very common (\u22651/10) Common (\u22651/100 to \n\n<1/10) \nNot known (cannot be \nestimated from the \navailable data) \n\nImmune system \ndysorders \n\n  Hypersensitivity \nreactions, (dyspnoea, \nangioedema, urticaria, \nrash) \n\nMetabolism and \nnutrition disorders \n\nhypercalcaemia, \nhypocalcaemia \n\nhypomagnesaemia\u2020, \ntetany\u2020 \n\n \n\nPsychiatric disorders  anxiety\u2020, insomnia*  \nNervous system \ndisorders \n\nheadache*,\u2020, \nhypoaesthesia\u2020, \nparaesthesia\u2020 \n\nsomnolence*  \n\nCardiac disorders  palpitations*,\u2020  \nVascular disorders  hypertension*  \nRespiratory, thoracic \nand mediastinal \n\n cough\u2020  \n\n\n\n8 \n\ndisorders \nGastrointestinal \ndisorders \n\ndiarrhoea*,\u2020, nausea*, \nvomiting* \n\nabdominal pain upper*  \n\nMusculoskeletal and \nconnective tissue \ndisorders \n\narthralgia*, muscle \nspasms\u2020 \n\nmuscle twitching\u2020, \nmusculoskeletal pain\u2020, \nmyalgia\u2020, neck pain\u2020, \npain in extremity \n\n \n\nRenal and urinary \ndisorders \n\n hypercalciuria*, \npollakiuria\u2020 \n\n \n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site \nconditions \n\n asthenia*, chest pain\u2020, \nfatigue, injection site \nreactions, thirst* \n\n \n\nInvestigations  anti-PTH antibody \npositive, blood \n25-hydroxycholecalcif\nerol decreased\u2020, \nvitamin D decreased \n\n \n\n*Signs and symptoms potentially associated with hypercalcaemia that were observed in the clinical trials. \n\u2020Signs and symptoms potentially associated with hypocalcaemia that were observed in the clinical trials. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \nHypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia were commonly encountered during the dose titration period. The \nrisk for serious hypocalcaemia was greatest after the withdrawal of Natpar. Cases of hypocalcaemia \nresulting in seizures have been reported post-marketing (see section 4.4). \n \nInjection site reactions \nIn the placebo-controlled study, 9.5% (8/84) Natpar-treated patients and 15% (6/40) placebo-treated \npatients experienced an injection site reaction, all of which were mild or moderate in severity. \n \nImmunogenicity \nConsistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing peptides, \nadministration of Natpar may trigger the development of antibodies. In the placebo-controlled study in \nadults with hypoparathyroidism, the incidence of anti-parathyroid hormone (PTH) antibodies was \n8.8% (3/34) and 5.9% (1/17) in patients who received subcutaneous administration of 50 to \n100 micrograms Natpar or placebo once daily for 24 weeks, respectively. \n \nAcross all clinical studies in patients with hypoparathyroidism following treatment with Natpar for up \nto 4 years, the immunogenicity incidence rate was 17/87 (19.5%) and did not appear to increase over \ntime. These 17 patients had low titre anti-PTH antibodies and, of these, 3 subsequently became \nantibody negative. The apparent transient nature of antibodies to PTH is likely due to the low titre. \nThree of these patients had antibodies with neutralising activity; these patients maintained a clinical \nresponse with no evidence of immune-related adverse reactions. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nOverdose can cause hypercalcaemia, the symptoms of which may include heart palpitations, ECG \nchanges, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and headache. Severe hypercalcaemia may be a \nlife-threatening condition requiring urgent medical care and careful monitoring (see section 4.4). \n \n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Calcium homeostasis, parathyroid hormones and analogues, ATC code: \nH05AA03 \n \nMechanism of action \nEndogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the parathyroid glands as a polypeptide of \n84 amino acids. PTH exerts its action via cell-surface parathyroid hormone receptors, present in bone, \nkidney and nerve tissue. Parathyroid hormone receptors belong to the family of G-coupled protein \nreceptors. \n \nPTH has a variety of critical physiological functions that include its central role in modulating serum \ncalcium and phosphate levels within tightly regulated levels, regulating renal calcium and phosphate \nexcretion, activating vitamin D, and maintaining normal bone turnover. \n \nNatpar is produced in E. coli using recombinant DNA technology, and is identical to the 84 amino \nacid sequence of endogenous human parathyroid hormone. \n \nPharmacodynamic effects \nPTH (1-84) is the principal regulator of plasma calcium homeostasis. In the kidney, PTH (1-84) \nincreases renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and promotes phosphate excretion. \n \nThe overall effect of PTH is to increase serum calcium concentration, to reduce urinary excretion of \ncalcium and to lower serum phosphate concentration. \n \nNatpar has the same primary amino acid sequence as endogenous parathyroid hormone and may be \nanticipated to have the same physiological actions. \n \nClinical efficacy and safety \nThe safety and clinical efficacy of Natpar in adults with hypoparathyroidism is derived from \n1 randomised, placebo-controlled study and an open-label extension study. In these studies, Natpar \nwas self-administered, with daily doses ranging from 25 to 100 micrograms per subcutaneous \ninjection. \n \nStudy 1 \u2013 REPLACE \nThe objective of this trial was to maintain serum calcium with Natpar while reducing or replacing oral \ncalcium and active vitamin D. The study was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, multicentre trial. In this trial, patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism receiving \ncalcium and active forms of vitamin D (vitamin D metabolite or analogues) were randomised to \nNatpar (n=84) or placebo (n=40). The mean age was 47.3 years (range 19 to 74 years); 79% were \nfemales. Patients had hypoparathyroidism for an average of 13.6 years. \n \nAt randomisation, active forms of vitamin D were reduced by 50% and patients were allocated to \nNatpar 50 micrograms daily or placebo. Randomisation was followed by a 12-week Natpar titration \nphase and a 12-week Natpar dose maintenance phase. \n \nNinety percent of patients who were randomised completed 24 weeks of treatment. \n \nFor the efficacy analysis, subjects that fulfilled three components of a three-part response criterion \nwere considered responders. A responder was defined using a composite primary efficacy endpoint of \nat least a 50% reduction from the baseline active vitamin D dose AND at least a 50% reduction from \nthe baseline oral calcium AND an albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration maintained or \nnormalised compared with the baseline value (\u22651.875 mmol/L) and did not exceed the upper limit of \nthe laboratory normal range. \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nAt the end of treatment, 46/84 (54.8%) patients treated with Natpar achieved the primary endpoint \nversus 1/40 (2.5%) with placebo (p<0.001). \n \nAt Week 24, for patients who completed the study, 34/79 (43%) Natpar patients were independent of \nactive vitamin D treatment and were receiving no more than 500 mg of calcium citrate, compared with \n2/33 (6.1%) placebo patients (p<0.001). \n \nSixty-nine percent (58/84) of subjects randomised to Natpar showed a reduction in oral calcium of \n\u226550% compared to 7.5% (3/40) of subjects randomised to placebo. The mean percent change from \nbaseline in oral calcium was -51.8% (SD 44.6) in subjects receiving Natpar compared to \n6.5% (SD 38.5) in the placebo group (p<0.001). In addition, 87% (73/84) of patients treated with \nNatpar showed a \u226550% reduction in oral active vitamin D versus 45% (18/40) in the placebo group. \n \nStudy 2 \u2013 RACE \nStudy 2 is a long-term, open-label extension study of daily subcutaneous dosing of Natpar in \nhypoparathyroidism patients who completed prior studies with Natpar. \n \nA total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients received doses of 25 micrograms, \n50 micrograms, 75 micrograms or 100 micrograms/day for up to approximately 60 months (mean \n1161 days, range 41 to 1820 days). \n \nThe results demonstrate durability of the physiological effects of Natpar over 60 months including \nmaintenance of mean albumin-corrected serum calcium levels (n=49, 2.11 \u00b10.19 mmol/L), a decrease \nfrom baseline in urinary calcium excretion (n=47, -2.23 \u00b15.9 mmol/24 h), a decrease in serum \nphosphate (n=49, -0.29 \u00b10.28 mmol/L) and the maintenance of normal calcium phosphate product \n(n=49, <4.4mmol2/L2). \n \nPaediatric population \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nNatpar in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hypoparathyroidism (see section 4.2 for \ninformation on paediatric use). \n \nThis medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called \u2018conditional approval\u2019 scheme. This \nmeans that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. \n \nThe European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every \nyear and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of Natpar following subcutaneous administration in the thigh of \nhypoparathyroidism subjects was consistent with that observed in healthy post-menopausal women \nwho received parathyroid hormone in the thigh and abdomen. \n \nAbsorption \nNatpar administered subcutaneously had an absolute bioavailability of 53%. \n \nDistribution \nFollowing intravenous administration, Natpar has a volume of distribution of 5.35 L at steady state. \n \nBiotransformation \nIn vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the clearance of Natpar is primarily a hepatic process \nwith a lesser role played by the kidneys. \n \nElimination \nIn the liver, parathyroid hormone is cleaved by cathepsins. In the kidney, parathyroid hormone and \nC-terminal fragments are cleared by glomerular filtration. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship \nParathyroid hormone (rDNA) was evaluated in an open-label PK/PD study in which 7 patients with \nhypoparathyroidism received single subcutaneous doses of 50 and 100 micrograms with a 7-day \nwashout interval between doses. \n \nPeak plasma concentrations (mean Tmax) of Natpar occur within 5 to 30 minutes and a second usually \nsmaller peak at 1 to 2 hours. The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) was 3.02 and 2.83 hours for the \n50 and 100 micrograms dose, respectively. The maximum mean increases of serum calcium, which \noccurred at 12 hours, were approximately 0.125 mmol/L and 0.175 mmol/L with the 50 micrograms \nand 100 micrograms dose, respectively. \n \nEffect on mineral metabolism \nTreatment with Natpar increases serum calcium concentration in hypoparathyroidism patients, and this \nincrease occurs in a dose-related manner. After a single injection of parathyroid hormone (rDNA), the \nmean serum total calcium reached its peak level between 10 and 12 hours. The calcaemic response is \nsustained for more than 24 hours after administration. \n \nUrinary calcium excretion \nTreatment with Natpar produces a decrease in urinary calcium excretion by 13 and 23% (50 and \n100 microgram dose, respectively) to a nadir in the 3 to 6 hour time point, which returns to pre-dosing \nlevels by 16 to 24 hours. \n \nPhosphate \nFollowing injection with Natpar, serum phosphate levels decrease proportionally to PTH(1-84) levels \nover the first 4 hours and persist over 24 hours post-injection. \n \nActive vitamin D \nSerum 1,25-(OH)2D increases following a single dose of Natpar to maximum levels at about 12 hours \nwith a return to near baseline levels by 24 hours. A greater increase in the levels of 1,25-(OH)2D in \nserum were observed with the 50 micrograms dose than with the 100 micrograms dose, likely due to \ndirect inhibition of the renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase enzyme by serum calcium. \n \nSpecial populations \n \nHepatic impairment \nA pharmacokinetic study in non-hypoparathyroidism subjects was conducted in 6 men and 6 women \nwith moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classification of 7-9 [Grade B]) as compared with a \nmatched group of 12 subjects with normal hepatic function. Following a single 100 micrograms \nsubcutaneous dose, the mean Cmax and baseline-corrected Cmax values were 18% to 20% greater in the \nmoderately impaired subjects than in those with normal function. There were no apparent differences \nin the serum total calcium concentration-time profiles between the 2 hepatic function groups. No dose \nadjustment for Natpar is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There \nare no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment \nPharmacokinetics following a single 100 micrograms subcutaneous dose of Natpar was evaluated \nin 16 non-impaired subjects (creatinine clearance (CLcr) >80 mL/min) and 16 subjects with renal \nimpairment. The mean maximum concentration (Cmax) of PTH following 100 micrograms parathyroid \nhormone (rDNA) in subjects with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 80 mL/min) was \napproximately 23% higher than that observed in subjects with normal renal function. Exposure to PTH \nas measured by AUC0-last and baseline-corrected AUC0-last was approximately 3.9% and 2.5%, \nrespectively, higher than that observed for subjects with normal renal function. \n \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild-to-moderate renal \nimpairment (CLcr 30 to 80 mL/min). No studies were conducted in patients on renal dialysis. There are \nno data in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \nPaediatric population \nPharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients are not available. \n \nElderly \nClinical studies with Natpar did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to \ndetermine whether response in these subjects is different from younger subjects. \n \nGender \nNo clinically relevant gender differences were observed in the REPLACE study. \n \nWeight \nNo dose adjustment is necessary based on weight. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, mutagenicity, toxicity to fertility and general reproduction, and local tolerance. \n \nRats treated with daily injections of Natpar for 2 years had dose-dependent exaggerated bone \nformation and an increased incidence of bone tumours, including osteosarcoma, most probably due to \na non-genotoxic mechanism. Due to the differences in bone physiology in rats and humans, the \nclinical relevance of these findings is unknown. No osteosarcomas have been observed in clinical \ntrials. \n \nNatpar did not adversely affect fertility or early embryonic development in rats, embryo-foetal \ndevelopment in rats and rabbits, or pre/post-natal development in rats. A minimal amount of Natpar is \nexcreted in the milk of lactating rats. \n \nIn monkeys receiving daily subcutaneous doses for 6 months, there was an increased occurrence of \nrenal tubular mineralisation at exposure levels 2.7 times the clinical exposure levels at the highest \ndose. \n \n \n6.

Contents of the pack and other information \n7 Instructions for use \n \n \n1. What Natpar is and what it is used for \n \nWhat is Natpar? \n \nNatpar is a hormone replacement for adults with under-active parathyroid glands, a condition known \nas \u2018hypoparathyroidism\u2019. \n \nHypoparathyroidism is a disease caused by low levels of parathyroid hormone, which is produced by \nthe parathyroid glands in the neck. This hormone controls the amount of calcium and phosphate in the \nblood and urine. \n \nIf your levels of parathyroid hormone are too low, you can have low blood calcium. Low calcium can \ncause symptoms in many parts of your body, including the bones, heart, skin, muscles, kidneys, brain \nand nerves. For a list of symptoms of low calcium, see section 4. \n \nNatpar is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone that helps you keep calcium and phosphate levels in \nyour blood and urine at a normal level. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Natpar \n \nDo not use Natpar \n- if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed \n\nin section 6) \n\n\n\n27 \n\n- if you are having or have had radiation therapy to the skeleton \n- if you have cancer of the bones or other cancer that has spread to your bones \n- if you are at increased risk of developing a bone cancer called osteosarcoma (for instance, if you \n\nhave Paget\u2019s disease or other bone diseases) \n- if a blood test shows you have unexplained increases in bone alkaline phosphatase \n- if you have pseudohypoparathyroidism, a rare condition where the body does not respond \n\nadequately to the parathyroid hormone produced by the body \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Natpar. \n \nIf you are treated with Natpar, you may have side effects related to low or high levels of calcium in \nyour blood (see section 4 for these side effects). \n \nThese effects are more likely to occur: \n- when first starting Natpar, \n- if you change your Natpar dose, \n- if you miss one of your daily injections, \n- if you stop taking Natpar for a short time or altogether. \n \nYou may be given medicines to treat or help prevent these side effects, or you may be asked to stop \nsome of the medicines you are taking. These medicines include calcium or vitamin D. \n \nIf your symptoms are severe, your doctor may give you additional medical treatment. \n \nYour doctor will check your calcium levels. You may need to change your Natpar dose or stop the \ninjections for a short time. \n \nTests and checks \nYour doctor will check how you respond to the treatment: \n- during the first 7 days of starting treatment and \n- if your dose is changed. \n \nThis will be done using tests to measure the level of calcium in your blood or urine. Your doctor may \ntell you to change the amount of calcium or vitamin D you take (in any form, including foods rich in \ncalcium). \n \nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Natpar if you suffer from kidney stones. \n \nChildren and adolescents \n \nNatpar should not be used in children or adolescents under 18 years old. \n \nOther medicines and Natpar \n \nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines, including: \n- digoxin, also known as digitalis, a heart medicine \n- medicines used to treat osteoporosis, called bisphosphonates, such as alendronic acid \n- medicines that can affect calcium levels in your blood such as lithium or some medicines used \n\nto increase the amount of urine (diuretics). \n \nPregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility \n \nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. There is limited information on the \n\n\n\n28 \n\nsafety of Natpar in pregnant women. Natpar has been shown to pass into breast milk in rats, but it is \nnot known if Natpar would pass into breast milk in humans. \n \nYour doctor will decide whether to start treatment with Natpar. Your doctor will also decide if you \nshould keep taking this medicine if you become pregnant or start breast-feeding while taking it. \n \nIt is not known if Natpar has any effects on fertility. \n \nDriving and using machines \n \nNatpar has no effect on your being able to drive or use machines. However, hypoparathyroidism itself \nmay affect your ability to concentrate. If your ability to concentrate is impaired, you should not drive \nor use machines until your ability to concentrate is improved. \n \nNatpar contains sodium \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose. This means that it is \nessentially \u201csodium-free\u201d. \n \n \n3. How to use Natpar \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor or nurse will train you on how to use the Natpar pen. \n \nNatpar is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection every day, using a pen to help you inject \nyour medicine. \n \nThe \u2018Natpar reusable pen\u2019 is called \u2018Natpar pen\u2019 or \u2018pen\u2019 in this leaflet. \n \nDose \n \nThe recommended starting dose of Natpar is 50 micrograms per day. \n- However, your doctor may start you on 25 micrograms per day based on a blood test result. \n- After 2 to 4 weeks, your doctor may adjust the dose. \n \nThe dose of Natpar varies from person to person. People may need between 25 and100 micrograms of \nNatpar per day. \n \nYour doctor may tell you to take other medicines such as calcium supplements or vitamin D while you \nare taking Natpar. Your doctor will tell you how much you should take each day. \n \nHow to use the pen \n \nRead \u201cSection 7. Instructions for use\u201d in this leaflet before you use the pen. \n \nDo not use the pen if the solution is cloudy or coloured or if it contains visible particles. \n \nBefore the pen is used for the first time, the medicine has to be mixed. \n \nAfter you have mixed the medicine, the Natpar pen is ready for use and the medicine can be injected \nunder the skin of your thigh. Inject in the other thigh the following day and continue to alternate \nbetween the two. \n \nIt is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Natpar, the name and batch number \nof the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. \n \n\n\n\n29 \n\nHow long to use \n \nKeep using Natpar for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. \n \nIf you use more Natpar than you should \n \nIf, by mistake, you inject more than one dose of Natpar in a day, contact your doctor or pharmacist \nimmediately. \n \nIf you forget to use Natpar \n \nIf you forget to use Natpar (or cannot inject it at your usual time), use your injection as soon as you \ncan but do not inject more than one dose in the same day. \n \nTake your next dose of Natpar at the usual time the next day. You may need to take more calcium \nsupplements if you have signs of low blood calcium; see section 4 for symptoms. \n \nDo not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Natpar \n \nDiscuss with your doctor if you want to stop treatment with Natpar. \n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSerious side effects \n \nThe following potentially serious side effects can occur when using Natpar: \n\u2022 Very common: high levels of calcium in your blood, which can occur more often when you start \n\ntreatment with Natpar. \n\u2022 Very common: low levels of calcium in your blood; this can occur more often if you suddenly \n\nstop taking Natpar. \n \nSymptoms related to high or low calcium levels are included in the list below.

Hold the pen so you can see the dose window. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n10. Turn the dosage knob until \u201cGO\u201d lines up with the notch in \nthe window. Do not turn the dosage knob past \u201cGO.\u201d \n \n\u2022 If the dosage knob is hard to turn, you may not have \n\nenough liquid left. \nCheck the dose indicator on the cartridge to see if there \nare any doses left or check the \u201cDiscard on\u201d date on the \nmedicine cartridge tracker to see if it has been more \nthan 14 days. \n \n\n \n\n11. Gently tap the cartridge 3 to 5 times. This moves any air \nbubbles away from the needle. \n\n \n12. Prepare the pen needle for giving the injection. \n\n \nWithout unscrewing, \n \n\u2022 Pull the needle cap straight off and set it aside. \n\u2022 Then pull off the needle guard and discard it. \n \n\n \n13. Hold the pen so you can see \u201cGO\u201d in the dose window with \n\nthe pen needle pointing down. \n\n \n14. Read steps 15, 16, and 17 carefully before you inject the medicine. \n\n \n15. Insert the needle fully into your thigh (you can pinch a fold of \n\nthe skin if told by your doctor or nurse). Make sure you can \nsee \u201cGO\u201d in the window. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n16. Press the injection button until the \u201c0\u201d lines up with the notch \nin the dose window. You should see and feel the dosage knob \nturn back to \u201c0.\u201d Slowly count to 10. \n \n\n \n \n\n Important note about injecting: \n \nTo avoid under-dosing, you will need to keep the needle in the \nskin for 10 seconds AFTER pressing the injection button. \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n17. Pull the needle straight out of your thigh. \n\n \n\u2022 It is normal to see 1 or 2 drops of liquid appear on the needle during this step. \n\u2022 If you do not think you received your full dose, do not take another dose. Call your doctor. \n\nYou may need to take calcium and vitamin D. \n \n\n18. Carefully recap the exposed needle with the large needle cap \nby using a scooping technique. \n \n\u2022 Make sure that the needle is pressed all the way into the \n\ncap. \n \n\n \n19. Unscrew the needle cap (with the pen needle inside) in a \n\ncounterclockwise direction while holding the cartridge. \n \n\u2022 Do not share your pen or pen needles with anyone else. \n\nYou may give an infection to them or get an infection \nfrom them. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n\n20.

pharmacist has told you. check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. your doctor or nurse will train you on how to use the natpar pen. natpar is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection every day, using a pen to help you inject your medicine. the 'natpar reusable pen' is called 'natpar pen' or 'pen' in this leaflet. dose the recommended starting dose of natpar is 50 micrograms per day. - however, your doctor may start you on 25 micrograms per day based on a blood test result. - after 2 to 4 weeks, your doctor may adjust the dose. the dose of natpar varies from person to person. people may need between 25 and100 micrograms of natpar per day. your doctor may tell you to take other medicines such as calcium supplements or vitamin d while you are taking natpar. your doctor will tell you how much you should take each day. how to use the pen read \"section 7. instructions for use\" in this leaflet before you use the pen. do not use the pen if the solution is cloudy or coloured or if it contains visible particles. before the pen is used for the first time, the medicine has to be mixed. after you have mixed the medicine, the natpar pen is ready for use and the medicine can be injected under the skin of your thigh. inject in the other thigh the following day and continue to alternate between the two. it is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of natpar, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a record of the batches used. how long to use keep using natpar for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. if you use more natpar than you should if, by mistake, you inject more than one dose of natpar in a day, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. if you forget to use natpar if you forget to use natpar (or cannot inject it at your usual time), use your injection as soon as you can but do not inject more than one dose in the same day. take your next dose of natpar at the usual time the next day. you may need to take more calcium supplements if you have signs of low blood calcium; see section 4 for symptoms. do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you stop using natpar discuss with your doctor if you want to stop treatment with natpar. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.",
