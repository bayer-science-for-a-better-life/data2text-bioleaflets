This will allow quick identification \nof new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse \nreactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. \n \n \n1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nSupemtek solution for injection in pre-filled syringe \n \nQuadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (recombinant, prepared in cell culture) \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \n\nOne dose (0.5 mL) contains: \nInfluenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) proteins, of the following strains*: \n \nA/XXXXXX (H1N1).................................. 45 micrograms HA \n\nA/XXXXXX (H3N2).................................. 45 micrograms HA \n\nB/XXXXXX ............................................... 45 micrograms HA \n\nB/XXXXXX ............................................... 45 micrograms HA \n\n \n* produced by recombinant DNA technology using a baculovirus expression system in a \ncontinuous insect cell line that is derived from Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera \nfrugiperda. \n \nThis vaccine complies with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation (Northern \nHemisphere) and EU recommendation for the XXXX/XXXX season. \n \nSupemtek may contain traces of octylphenol ethoxylate. \n \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nSolution for injection in pre-filled syringe (injection). \n\nClear and colourless solution.  \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nSupemtek is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in adults.  \n \nSupemtek should be used in accordance with official recommendations. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nPosology: \n\nOne dose of 0.5 mL. \n \nPaediatric population \nSafety and efficacy of Supemtek have not yet been established in individuals below 18 years of age.  \n \nMethod of administration: \n\nFor intramuscular injection only. The preferred site is in the deltoid muscle. \nThe vaccine must not be injected intravascularly and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the \nsame syringe. \n \nFor instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any trace \nresiduals such as octylphenol ethoxylate. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nTraceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \n\nHypersensitivity \nAppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an \nanaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. \n\nIntercurrent illness \nVaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved. \n\nImmunodeficiency \nAntibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be \ninsufficient to prevent influenza. \n\nThrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders \nAs with all injectable vaccines, Supemtek must be administered with caution to individuals with \nthrombocytopaenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular \nadministration to these subjects. \n \nSyncope \nSyncope can occur following or even before any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the \nneedle injection.This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual \ndisturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Procedures should be \nin place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope. \n\nProtection \nAs with any vaccine, vaccination with Supemtek may not protect all vaccinees. \n\nSodium content \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say is \nessentially “sodium free”. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed, nor data to assess the concomitant administration of \nSupemtek with other vaccines. \nIf Supemtek is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should \nalways be administered at different injection sites. \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \nThere is a limited amount of data from the use of Supemtek in pregnant women. \nOne animal study performed with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate direct or \nindirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-foetal development or early post-natal \ndevelopment. \nAn assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a health care professional before \nadministering Supemtek to a pregnant woman. \n \nBreast-feeding \nIt is not known whether Supemtek vaccine is excreted in human milk. \nAn assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a health care professional before \nadministering Supemtek to a breast-feeding woman. \n \nFertility \nNo human fertility data are available. \nThe animal study with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate harmful effects on \nfemale fertility. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nSupemtek has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n\nSupemtek has been administered to and safety data collected from 998 adults 18-49 years of age \n(Study 1) and 4328 adults 50 years of age and older (Study 2).  \nThe most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were injection-site reactions \n(tenderness and pain) reported overall by 48% and 37% of study participants 18-49 years of age \nreceiving Supemtek respectively. In study participants 50 years of age and older, injection site \ntenderness was reported by 34% and injection site pain reported by 19%. \nThe severity of the reactions was mild to moderate. Onset usually occurred within the first 3 days \nafter vaccination. All resolved without sequelae. \n \nTabulated list of adverse reactions \n\nThe adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class under headings of frequency using \nthe following convention:  \nVery common (≥1/10);  \nCommon (≥1/100 to <1/10);  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nUncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);  \nRare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000);  \nVery rare (<1/10,000);  \nFrequency not known (adverse reactions from post-marketing experience; cannot be estimated from \nthe available data).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 \n \nImmunogenicity \n\nSupemtek was evaluated in healthy adults of 18-49 years of age in a randomized, observer-blind, \nactive controlled, non-inferiority immunogenicity, multi-center trial conducted during the 2014-\n2015 influenza season in the United States (study 1).  \nIn the study 1, subjects received Supemtek (N=998) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated \ninfluenza vaccine (IIV4) (N=332). Immunogenicity was assessed before and 28 days after \nadministration of a single dose of study vaccine. \n\nHaemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were determined for the two \nvaccine groups for each vaccine antigen. Immunogenicity was compared by calculating the \ndifference in seroconversion rates (SCR) and the ratios of GMTs of Comparator to Supemtek.  \n\nStudy 1 had two co-primary endpoints: GMTs and Day 28 HAI seroconversion rates for each of the \nfour antigens contained in the study vaccines.  \n\nSupemtek met the success criterion for GMTs for three of the four antigens but did not meet the \nsuccess criteria for the B/Victoria lineage antigen (Table 2). Antibody titres against the B/Victoria \nwere low in both vaccine groups. \n \nTable 2: Comparison of Day 28 Post-Vaccination Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) for \nSupemtek and Comparator in Adults 18-49 Years of Age, Study 1 (Immunogenicity \nPopulation) 1,2,3  \n\nAntigen Post-vaccination GMT Supemtek N=969 \nPost-vaccination GMT \nComparator N=323 \n\nGMT Ratio \nComparator/ \nSupemtek (95% CI)\n\nA/H1N1 493 397 0.81 (0.71, 0.92)\nA/H3N2 748 377 0.50 (0.44, 0.57)\nB/Yamagata 156 134 0.86 ( 0.74, 0.99)\nB/Victoria 43 64 1.49 (1.29, 1.71)\n\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GMT, geometric mean titer.  \n1 HI titers were assayed using egg-derived antigens. \n2 Comparator: egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. \n3 Success in meeting the GMTs endpoint was pre-defined as an upper bound (UB) of the two-sided 95% CI of \nGMTComparator / GMT Supemtek ≤ 1.5. \n \nSupemtek met the success criterion for SCRs for three of the four antigens (Table 3), but not for the \nB/Victoria lineage.

These adults 18-49 years of age were vaccinated during the same \ninfluenza season (2014-2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season) and received the same \nSupemtek formulation (same vaccine strain composition) as adults of 50 years of age and older in \nthe study 2. The immune response induced by Supemtek was assessed by the same HAI assay and \nperformed by the same laboratory for both studies.

Supemtek met the pre-\nspecified success criterion for non-inferiority to the comparator pre-defined as a lower bound of the \ntwo sided 95% CI >-20%.  \n\nOf the 4474 participants exposed to Supemtek in a phase 3 active-controlled study (Study 2), a total \nof 1761 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed \nbetween older and younger participants, the number of patients aged 65 and over in this study was \nnot sufficient to determine statistically whether this age group will respond differently from younger \nindividuals. \n \nTable 5: Relative Vaccine Efficacy (rVE) of Supemtek versus Comparator against \nLaboratory-Confirmed Influenza, Regardless of Antigenic Similarity to Vaccine Antigens, \nAdults 50 Years of Age and Older, Study 2 (Efficacy Population)1,2 \n\n Supemtek \n(N=4303) \n\nComparator \n(N=4301) RR rVE % (95% CI) \n\nn Attack Rate % (n/N) n \nAttack Rate \n% (n/N) \n\nAll rtPCR-positive \nInfluenza3 96 2.2 138 3.2 0.70 30 (10\n\n5, 47) \n\nAll rtPCR-positive \nInfluenza A3 73 1.7 114 2.7 0.64 36 (14, 53) \n\nAll rtPCR-positive \nInfluenza B3 23 0.5 24 0.6 0.96 4 (-72, 46) \n\nAll Culture-confirmed \nProtocol-defined ILI3,4 58 1.3 101 2.3 0.57 43 (21, 59) \n\nAbbreviations: rtPCR=reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; Comparator= an egg-based quadrivalent \ninactivated influenza vaccine; n=number of influenza cases; N=number of subjects in treatment group; RR=relative risk \n(Attack Rate Supemtek/Attack Rate IIV4); rVE = [(1-RR) x 100].  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n1 Excluded subjects with protocol deviations that could adversely affect efficacy. \n2 Primary Analysis. All cases of rtPCR-confirmed influenza are included. \n3 Post hoc analyses. All cases of influenza A were A/H3N2. Cases of influenza B were not distinguished by lineage.  \n4 Culture of rtPCR-positive samples was performed in MDCK cells. \n5 The lower bound (LB) of the 95% confidence interval met the pre-specified, exploratory criterion for superior relative \nvaccine efficacy, LB > 9%. \n \nEfficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3)  \n\nThe efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) is relevant to Supemtek because \nboth vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. \n\nThe efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine in protecting against influenza illness was \nevaluated in a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted in the \nUnited States during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (Study 3). \n\nStudy 3 enrolled and vaccinated 4648 healthy adults randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single \ndose of RIV3 (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304).  \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint of Study 3 was defined as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with a \npositive culture for an influenza virus strain antigenically resembling a strain represented in RIV3. \nILI is defined as fever of ≥100°F (37.8°C) oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both, on the \nsame or consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the reduction in the \ninfluenza rate for RIV3 relative to placebo, were calculated for the total vaccinated cohort (n=4648).  \nDue to very small number of cultured confirmed influenza cases with matched strains, an \nexploratory analysis of VE of RIV3 against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from \nany subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting ILI criteria was done, demonstrated an efficacy \nestimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 6 for VE by case definition. \n \nTable 6: Vaccine Efficacy Against Culture-Confirmed Influenza in Healthy Adults 18-\n49 Years of Age, Study 31,3 \n\nCase definition \nRIV3 (N=2344) Saline Placebo (N=2304) \n\nRIV3 \nVaccine \nEfficacy4 \n% \n\n95% \nConfidence \nInterval Cases, \n\nn \nRate, \n% \n\nCases, \nn \n\nRate, \n% \n\nPositive culture with a strain represented in the vaccine \nCDC-ILI2, all matched strains5 1 0.04 4 0.2 75.4 (-148.0, 99.5) \nAny ILI, all matched strains 2 0.1 6 0.3 67.2 (-83.2, 96.8) \nPositive culture with any strain, regardless of match to the vaccine \nCDC-ILI2, all strains 44 1.9 78 3.4 44.6 (18.8, 62.6) \nSub-Type A 26 1.1 56 2.4 54.4 (26.1, 72.5) \nType B 18 0.8 23 1.0 23.1 (-49.0, 60.9) \nAny ILI, all strains 64 2.7 114 4.9 44.8 (24.4, 60.0) \nSub-Type A 41 1.7 79 3.4 49.0 (24.7, 65.9) \nType B 23 1.0 36 1.6 37.2 (-8.9, 64.5) \n\n1 Vaccine efficacy (VE) = 1 minus the ratio of RIV3 /placebo infection rates (10). \n2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - defined influenza-like illness (CDC-ILI) defined as fever of ≥100ºF \n(37.8°C) oral accompanied by cough and/or sore throat, on the same day or on consecutive days. \n3 The pre-defined success criterion for the primary efficacy analysis was that the lower bound of the 95% confidence \ninterval (CI) of VE should be at least 40%. \n4 Determined under the assumption of Poisson event rates, according to Breslow and Day, 1987. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n5 Primary endpoint of trial.  \n \n\nPaediatric population \n\nThe European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSupemtek in children from 6 months to 3 years of age for the prevention of influenza infection.  \nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \nSupemtek in children from 3 years to 17 years of age for the prevention of influenza infection (see \nsection 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nNot applicable. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical safety data on the trivalent formulation revealed no special hazard for humans based on \nconventional studies of repeat dose and local toxicity, reproductive and developmental (including \nteratogenicity) toxicity and safety pharmacology studies.The results of these studies with trivalent \nrecombinant influenza vaccine are relevant to Supemtek because both vaccines are manufactured \nusing the same process and have overlapping compositions. \n \n \n6.

This will allow quick identification of new \nsafety information. You can help by reporting any side affects you may get. See the end of section 4 \nfor how to report side effects. \n\nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n\n- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. \n- This vaccine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. \n- If  you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \n\nWhat is in this leaflet:  \n\n1. What Supemtek is and what it is used for  \n2. What you need to know before you receive Supemtek \n3. How Supemtek is given \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Supemtek \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n \n \n1. What Supemtek is and what it is used for  \n\n \nSupemtek is a vaccine for adults who are 18 years of age and older. This vaccine helps to protect \nyou against flu (influenza). Supemtek is egg-free because of the technology used to produce it. \n \nHow Supemtek works \nWhen a person is given Supemtek, the body’s natural defence (the immune system) produces \nprotection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. \nAs with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n \nWhen to have a flu vaccine \nFlu can spread very fast.  \n• It is caused by different types of flu virus that can change every year. This is why you might \n\nneed to be vaccinated every year.  \n• The greatest risk of catching flu is during the cold months between October and March.  \n• If you were not vaccinated in the autumn, it is still sensible to be vaccinated up until the spring \n\nsince you run the risk of catching flu until then.  \nYour doctor will be able to recommend the best time to be vaccinated. \n\n \n \n2. What you need to know before you receive Supemtek \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \nDo not use Supemtek if you are allergic to :  \n\n• the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  \n• octylphenol ethoxylate (octoxinol-9), a trace residual from the manufacturing process.  \n\n \nWarnings and precautions  \n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Supemtek. \n\nAs with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. \n\nBefore receiving the vaccine, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if: \n• you have a short-term illness with fever. Vaccination may need to be delayed until your \n\nfever has gone. \n• you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency or you are taking medicines that \n\naffect the immune system such as cancer medicine (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid \nmedicines). \n\n• you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. \n• you have fainted with an injection before. Fainting can happen after, or even before an \n\ninjection. \nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \nreceiving Supemtek.  \n \nOther medicines and Supemtek \n\nTell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, \nincluding medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other \nvaccine.  \nSupemtek may be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate limbs. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding  \n\nIf you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask \nyour doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this vaccine. Your doctor or pharmacist will help \nyou to decide if you should receive Supemtek. \n \nDriving and using machines \n\nSupemtek has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machine. \n \nSupemtek contains sodium   \n\nThis vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, this means that it’s essentially \n‘sodium free’.  \n \n \n3. How Supemtek is given \n\n \nSupemtek is given to you by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist as an injection into the muscle at the \ntop of the upper arm (deltoid muscle). \n\nAdults from 18 years of age and older: \n\nOne dose of 0.5 mL. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects  \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. \n \nSevere allergic reactions \nContact your doctor or healthcare professional immediately or go to the nearest hospital emergency \nroom right away if you have an allergic reaction. It can be life-threatening. \nSymptoms include: \n• difficulty breathing, shortness of breath  \n• swelling of the face, lips, throat or tongue  \n• cold, clammy skin  \n• palpitations \n• feeling dizzy, feeling weak, fainting \n• rash or itching \n\n \nThe following side effects have been reported with Supemtek: \n \nOther side effects \nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): \n• pain at the injection site \n• feeling tired (fatigue)  \n• headache  \n• muscle pain and joint pain  \nMuscle pain and joint pain are common in adults aged 50 years and older. \n \nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):  \n• feeling sick (nausea) \n• redness, swelling, hardening around the area where the vaccine is injected \n• fever, shivering  \nFever is rare in adults aged 50 years and older. \n \nUncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): \n• diarrhoea \n• itching, skin irritation, rash \n• flu-like symptoms \n• cough, mouth and throat pain \n• itching where the vaccine is injected \nItching is rare in adults aged 50 years and older. \nSkin irritation and rash have not been reported in adults aged 50 years and older. \nFlu-like symptoms has not been reported in adults aged 18-49 years. \n \nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 people): \n• feeling dizzy \n• hives  \nFeeling dizzy and hives have not been reported in adults aged 18-49 years. \n \nNot known (cannot be estimated from the available data): \n•   neurological disorders that may result in stiff neck, confusion, numbness, pain and weakness of the \nlimbs, loss of balance, loss of reflexes, paralysis of part or all the body (Guillain-Barré syndrome). \n \nReporting of side effects \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on \nthe safety of this medicine. \n \n \n5.  How to store Supemtek \n \nKeep this vaccine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nStore in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).
