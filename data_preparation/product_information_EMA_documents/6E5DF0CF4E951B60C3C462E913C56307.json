NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \n \nFuzeon 90 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \n \n \n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \n \nEach vial contains 108 mg enfuvirtide.  \nEach ml of reconstituted solution contains 90 mg enfuvirtide. \nExcipient with known effect: sodium. Contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. \nessentially ‘sodium-free’. \nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \n \n \n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM \n \nPowder and solvent for solution for injection. \nWhite to off-white lyophilised powder. \n \n \n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS \n \n4.1 Therapeutic indications \n \nFuzeon is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of \nHIV-1 infected patients who have received treatment with and failed on regimens containing at least \none medicinal product from each of the following antiretroviral classes: protease inhibitors, non-\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or who have \nintolerance to previous antiretroviral regimens (see section 5.1). \n \nIn deciding on a new regimen for patients who have failed an antiretroviral regimen, careful \nconsideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of \nmutations associated with different medicinal products. Where available, resistance testing may be \nappropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \n4.2 Posology and method of administration \n \nFuzeon should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. \n \nPosology \n \nAdults and adolescents ≥ 16 years: The recommended dose of Fuzeon is 90 mg twice daily injected \nsubcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen. \n \nIn case a Fuzeon dose is missed, patients should be instructed to administer the dose as soon as \npossible. However, if it is less than 6 hours before the next regular dose, the missed dose should be \nskipped \nElderly: There is no experience in patients > 65 years old. \n \n\n\n\n3 \n\nChildren ≥ 6 years and adolescents: The experience in children is limited (see section 5.2). In clinical \ntrials the dosage regimen in Table 1 below was used: \n \nTable 1: Paediatric Dosing  \n\nWeight (kg) Dose per bid injection \n(mg/dose) \n\nInjection volume \n(90 mg enfuvirtide \n\nper ml) \n\n11.0 to 15.5 27 0.3 ml \n15.6 to 20.0 36 0.4 ml \n20.1 to 24.5 45 0.5 ml \n24.6 to 29.0 54 0.6 ml \n29.1 to 33.5 63 0.7 ml \n33.6 to 38.0 72 0.8 ml \n38.1 to 42.5 81 0.9 ml \n\n≥42.6 90 1.0 ml \n \nFuzeon is not recommended for use in children below age 6 due to insufficient data on safety and \nefficacy (see section 5.2). \n \nRenal impairment: No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment including those \nreceiving dialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nHepatic impairment: No data are available to establish a dose recommendation for patients with \nhepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). \n \nMethod of Administration  \n \nFuzeon is only to be administered by subcutaneous injection. For instructions on reconstitution before \nadministration, see section 6.6. \n \n4.3 Contraindications \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nFuzeon must be taken as part of a combination regimen. Please also refer to the respective summary of \nproduct characteristics of the other antiretroviral medicinal products used in the combination. As with \nother antiretrovirals, enfuvirtide should optimally be combined with other antiretrovirals to which the \npatient’s virus is sensitive (see section 5.1). \n \nPatients should be informed that Fuzeon is not a cure for HIV-1 infection. While effective viral \nsuppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual \ntransmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken \nin accordance with national guidelines. \n \nAnimal studies have shown that enfuvirtide may impair some immune functions (see section 5.3). In \nclinical trials, an increased rate of some bacterial infections, most notably a higher rate of pneumonia, \nwas seen in patients treated with Fuzeon; however, an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia related to \nthe use of Fuzeon has not been confirmed by subsequent epidemiological data. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions have occasionally been associated with therapy with enfuvirtide and in rare \ncases hypersensitivity reactions have recurred on rechallenge. Events included rash, fever, nausea and \nvomiting, chills, rigors, low blood pressure and elevated serum liver transaminases in various \ncombinations, and possibly primary immune complex reaction, respiratory distress and \n\n\n\n4 \n\nglomerulonephritis. Patients developing signs/symptoms of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction should \ndiscontinue enfuvirtide treatment and should seek medical evaluation immediately. Therapy with \nenfuvirtide should not be restarted following systemic signs and symptoms consistent with a \nhypersensitivity reaction considered related to enfuvirtide. Risk factors that may predict the \noccurrence or severity of hypersensitivity to enfuvirtide have not been identified. \n \nLiver disease: The safety and efficacy of enfuvirtide has not been specifically studied in patients with \nsignificant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B and C and treated with \nantiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. \nFew patients included in the phase III trials were co-infected with hepatitis B/C. In these the addition \nof Fuzeon did not increase the incidence of hepatic events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \n \nAdministration of Fuzeon to non-HIV-1 infected individuals may induce anti-enfuvirtide antibodies \nthat cross-react with HIV gp41. This may result in a false positive HIV test with the anti-HIV ELISA \ntest. \n \nThere is no experience in patients with reduced hepatic function. Data is limited in patients with \nmoderate to severe renal impairment, and in patients maintained on dialysis. Fuzeon should be used \nwith caution in these populations (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \n \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time \nof institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to \nasymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or \naggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or \nmonths of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or \nfocal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms \nshould be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. \n \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \ncan occur many months after initiation of treatment. \n \nOsteonecrosis: \nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nInteraction studies have only been performed in adults. \n \nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and \nconcomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. \n \nInfluence of enfuvirtide on metabolism of concomitant medicinal products: In an in-vivo human \nmetabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the \nmetabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), \nCYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). \n \nInfluence of concomitant medicinal products on enfuvirtide metabolism: In separate pharmacokinetic \ninteraction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in \ncombination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in \nclinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide. \n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies do \nnot indicate harmful effects with respect to foetal development. Enfuvirtide should be used during \npregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \n \nBreast-feeding: It is not known whether enfuvirtide is secreted in human milk. Mothers should be \ninstructed not to breast-feed if they are receiving enfuvirtide because of the potential for HIV \ntransmission and any possible undesirable effects in breast-fed infants. \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. There is no \nevidence that enfuvirtide may alter the patient’s ability to drive and use machines, however, the \nadverse event profile of enfuvirtide should be taken into account (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 Undesirable effects  \n \na. Summary of the safety profile \n \nSafety data mainly refer to 48-week data from studies TORO 1 and TORO 2 combined (see section \n5.1). Safety results are expressed as the number of patients with an adverse reaction per 100 patient-\nyears of exposure (except for injection site reactions). \n \nThe most frequently reported events were injection site reactions, diarrhoea and nausea. The addition \nof Fuzeon to background antiretroviral therapy generally did not increase the frequency or severity of \nmost adverse reactions. \n \nb. Tabulated list of adverse reactions \nTable 2 presents events seen at a higher rate among patients receiving Fuzeon + OB regimen than \namong patients on the OB alone regimen with an exposure adjusted increase of at least 2 patients with \nevent per 100 patient-years. A statistically significant increase was seen for pneumonia and \nlymphadenopathy. Most adverse reactions were of mild or moderate intensity. Adverse reactions are \nlisted according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories are \ndefined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); \nuncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known \n(cannot be estimated from the available data). \n \n\n\n\n6 \n\nTable 2:  Adverse reactions attributed to treatment with Fuzeon in studies TORO 1 and \nTORO 2 combined \n\n \nSystem organ class \nFrequency \n\nAdverse reaction \n\nInfections and infestations \nCommon \n \n\n \nSinusitis, skin papilloma, influenza, pneumonia, \near infection \n\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \nCommon \n \n\n \nLymphadenopathy \n\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders \nCommon \n \n\n \nAppetite decreased, anorexia, \nhypertriglyceridaemia, blood triglycerides \nincreased, diabetes mellitus \n\nPsychiatric disorders \nCommon \n \n\n \nAnxiety, nightmare, irritability \n\nNervous system disorders \nVery common \nCommon \n \n\n \nPeripheral neuropathy \nHypoaesthesia, disturbance in attention, tremor \n\nEye disorders  \nCommon \n \n\n \nConjunctivitis \n\nEar and labyrinth disorders \nCommon  \n \n\n \nVertigo \n\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \nCommon  \n \n\n \nNasal congestion \n\nGastrointestinal disorders  \nCommon \n \n\n \nPancreatitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease \n\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \nCommon \n\n \nDry skin, eczema seborrhoeic, erythema, acne \n \n\nMusculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone \ndisorders \nCommon \n \n\n \n \nMyalgia \n\nRenal and Urinary Disorders  \nCommon \n \n\n \nNephrolithiasis, haematuria \n\nGeneral disorders and administration site \nconditions \nVery common \nCommon  \n \n\n \n \nWeight decreased \nInfluenza like illness, asthenia \n\n  \nc. Description of selected adverse reactions \n \nInjection site reactions \n \nInjection site reactions (ISRs) were the most frequently reported adverse reaction and occurred in 98% \nof the patients (Table 3). The vast majority of ISRs occurred within the first week of Fuzeon \nadministration and were associated with mild to moderate pain or discomfort at the injection site \n\n\n\n7 \n\nwithout limitation of usual activities. The severity of the pain and discomfort did not increase with \ntreatment duration. The signs and symptoms generally lasted equal to or less than 7 days. Infections at \nthe injection site (including abscess and cellulitis) occurred in 1.5% of patients. \n \nTable 3: Summary of individual signs/symptoms characterising local injection site reactions \n\nin studies TORO 1 and TORO 2 combined (% of patients) \n n=663 \nWithdrawal Rate due to ISRs 4% \nEvent Category Fuzeon \n\n+Optimised \nbackgrounda \n\n%  of Event \ncomprising \n\nGrade 3 reactions \n\n%  of Event \ncomprising \n\nGrade 4 reactions \nPain / discomfort 96.1% 11.0%b 0%b \nErythema 90.8% 23.8%c 10.5%c \nInduration 90.2% 43.5%d 19.4%d \nNodules and cysts 80.4% 29.1%e 0.2%e \nPruritus 65.2% 3.9%f NA \nEcchymosis 51.9% 8.7%g 4.7%g \naAny severity grade. \nbGrade 3= severe pain requiring analgesics (or narcotic analgesics for ≤ 72 hours) and/or limiting usual activities; Grade 4= \nsevere pain requiring hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, resulting in death, or persistent or significant \ndisability/incapacity, or life-threatening, or medically significant. \ncGrade 3= ≥ 50 mm but < 85 mm average diameter; Grade 4= ≥ 85 mm average diameter. \ndGrade 3= ≥ 25 mm but < 50 mm average diameter; Grade 4= ≥ 50 mm average diameter. \n eGrade 3= ≥ 3 cm; Grade 4= If draining. \nfGrade 3= refractory to topical treatment or requiring oral or parenteral treatment; Grade 4= not defined.  \ngGrade 3= > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm; Grade 4= > 5 cm. \n \nIn addition there have been a small number of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to enfuvirtide and \nin some cases recurrence has occurred upon re-challenge (see section 4.4). \n \nOther adverse reactions \n \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \ninfections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). \n \nCases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk \nfactors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see \nsection 4.4). \n \nAs a peptide, enfuvirtide can cause cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \n \nThe majority of patients had no change in the toxicity grade of any laboratory parameter during the \nstudy except for those listed in Table 4. Through week 48, eosinophilia [greater than the Upper Limit \nof Normal of > 0.7 x 109/l] occurred at a higher rate amongst patients in the Fuzeon containing group \n(12.4 patients with event per 100 patient-years) compared with OB alone regimen (5.6 patients with \nevent per 100 patient-years). When using a higher threshold for eosinophilia (>1.4 x 109/l), the patient \nexposure adjusted rate of eosinophilia is equal in both groups (1.8 patients with event per 100 patient-\nyears). \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\nTable 4: Exposure adjusted Grade 3 & 4 laboratory abnormalities among patients on \nFuzeon+OB and OB alone regimens, reported at more than 2 patients with event per \n100 patient years \n\nLaboratory Parameters \nGrading \n\nFuzeon+OB regimen \nPer 100 patient years \n\nOB alone regimen \nPer 100 patient years \n\nn \n(Total Exposure patient years) \n\n663 \n(557.0) \n\n334 \n(162.1) \n\nALAT \nGr. 3 (>5-10 x ULN) 4.8 4.3 \nGr. 4 (>10 x ULN) 1.4 1.2 \n\nHaemoglobin \nGr. 3 (6.5-7.9 g/dL) 2.0 1.9 \nGr. 4 (<6.5 g/dL) 0.7 1.2 \n\nCreatinine phosphokinase \nGr. 3 (>5-10 x ULN) 8.3 8.0 \nGr. 4 (>10 x ULN) 3.1 8.6 \n\n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 Overdose \n \nNo case of overdose has been reported. The highest dose administered to 12 patients in a clinical trial \nwas 180 mg as a single dose subcutaneously. These patients did not experience any adverse reactions \nthat were not seen with the recommended dose. In an Early Access Program study, one patient was \nadministered 180 mg of Fuzeon as a single dose on one occasion. He did not experience an adverse \nreaction as a result. \n \nThere is no specific antidote for overdose with enfuvirtide. Treatment of overdose should consist of \ngeneral supportive measures. \n \n \n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES \n \n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group: Other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX07 \n \nMechanism of Action: Enfuvirtide is a member of the therapeutic class called fusion inhibitors. It is an \ninhibitor of the structural rearrangement of HIV-1 gp41 and functions by specifically binding to this \nvirus protein extracellularly thereby blocking fusion between the viral cell membrane and the target \ncell membrane, preventing the viral RNA from entering into the target cell.  \n \nAntiviral activity in vitro: The susceptibility to enfuvirtide of 612 HIV recombinants containing the \nenv genes from HIV RNA samples taken at baseline from patients in Phase III studies gave a \ngeometric mean EC 50 of 0.259 µg/ml (geometric mean + 2SD = 1.96 µg/ml) in a recombinant \nphenotype HIV entry assay. Enfuvirtide also inhibited HIV-1 envelope mediated cell-cell fusion. \nCombination studies of enfuvirtide with representative members of the various antiretroviral classes \nexhibited additive to synergistic antiviral activities and an absence of antagonism. The relationship \nbetween the in vitro susceptibility of HIV-1 to enfuvirtide and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in \nhumans has not been established. \n \nAntiretroviral drug resistance: Incomplete viral suppression may lead to the development of drug \nresistance to one or more components of the regimen.  \n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n9 \n\nIn Vitro resistance to enfuvirtide: HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to enfuvirtide have been \nselected in vitro which harbour substitutions in amino acids (aa) 36-38 of the gp41 ectodomain. These \nsubstitutions were correlated with varying levels of reduced enfuvirtide susceptibility in HIV site-\ndirected mutants. \n \nIn Vivo resistance to enfuvirtide: In phase III clinical studies HIV recombinants containing the env \ngenes from HIV RNA samples taken up to week 24 from 187 patients showed > 4 fold reduced \nsusceptibility to enfuvirtide compared with the corresponding pre-treatment samples. Of these, \n185 (98.9%) env genes carried specific substitutions in region of aa 36 - 45 of gp41. The substitutions \nobserved in decreasing frequency were at aa positions 38, 43, 36, 40, 42 and 45. Specific single \nsubstitutions at these residues in gp41 each resulted in a range of decreases from baseline in \nrecombinant viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide. The geometric mean changes ranged from 15.2 fold for \nV38M to 41.6 fold for V38A. There were insufficient examples of multiple substitutions to determine \nany consistent patterns of substitutions or their effect on viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide. The \nrelationship of these substitutions to in vivo effectiveness of enfuvirtide has not been established. \nDecrease in viral sensitivity was correlated to the degree of pre-treatment resistance to background \ntherapy. (see Table 6). \n \nCross-resistance: Due to its novel viral target enfuvirtide is equally active in vitro against both wild-\ntype laboratory and clinical isolates and those with resistance to 1, 2 or 3 other classes of \nantiretrovirals (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors and protease inhibitors). Conversely, mutations in aa 36-45 of gp41 which give resistance to \nenfuvirtide would not be expected to give cross resistance to other classes of antiretrovirals. \n \nClinical Pharmacodynamic data \n \nStudies in Antiretroviral Experienced Patients: The clinical activity of Fuzeon (in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents) on plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts have been investigated in two \nrandomised, multicentre, controlled studies (TORO 1 and TORO 2) of Fuzeon of 48 weeks duration. \n995 patients comprised the intent-to-treat population. Patient demographics include a median baseline \nHIV-1 RNA of 5.2 log10 copies/ml and 5.1 log10 copies/ml and median baseline CD4 cell count of \n88 cells/mm3 and 97 cells/mm3 for Fuzeon + OB and OB, respectively. Patients had prior exposure to \na median of 12 antiretrovirals for a median of 7 years. All patients received an optimised background \n(OB) regimen consisting of 3 to 5 antiretroviral agents selected on the basis of the patient's prior \ntreatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance measurements. \n \nThe proportion of patients achieving viral load of <400 copies/ml at week 48 was 30.4% among \npatients on the Fuzeon + OB regimen compared to 12% among patients receiving OB regimen only. \nThe mean CD4 cell count increase was greater in patients on the Fuzeon + OB regimen than in \npatients on OB regimen only (see Table 5). \n \n\n\n\n10 \n\nTable 5 Outcomes of Randomised Treatment at Week 48 (Pooled Studies TORO 1 and \nTORO 2, ITT) \n\nOutcomes Fuzeon + OB \n90 mg bid \n(N=661) \n\nOB  \n(N=334) \n\nTreatment \nDifference \n\n95% \nConfidence \n\nInterval \n\np-value \n\nHIV-1 RNA  \nLog Change from baseline \n(log10 copies/ml)* \n\n-1.48 -0.63 LSM \n-0.85 \n\n-1.073, -\n0.628 \n\n<.0001 \n\nCD4+ cell count  \nChange from baseline \n(cells/mm3)# \n\n+91 +45 LSM \n46.4 \n\n25.1, 67.8 <.0001 \n\nHIV RNA >1 log below \nBaseline** \n\n247 (37.4%) 57 (17.1%) Odds Ratio \n3.02 \n\n2.16, 4.20 <.0001 \n\nHIV RNA <400 copies/ml** 201 (30.4%) 40 (12.0%) Odds Ratio \n3.45 \n\n2.36, 5.06 <.0001 \n\nHIV RNA <50 copies/ml** 121 (18.3%) 26 (7.8%) Odds Ratio \n2.77 \n\n1.76, 4.37 <.0001 \n\nDiscontinued due to adverse \nreactions/intercurrent \nillness/labs† \n\n9% 11%    \n\nDiscontinued due to injection \nsite reactions† \n\n4% N/A    \n\nDiscontinued due to other \nreasons†φ§ \n\n13% 25%    \n\n* Based on results from pooled data of TORO 1 and TORO 2 on ITT population, week 48 viral load for subjects who \nwere lost to follow-up, discontinued therapy, or had virological failure replaced by their last observation (LOCF). \n\n# Last value carried forward. \n** M-H test: Discontinuations or virological failure considered as failures. \n† Percentages based on safety population Fuzeon+background (N=663) and background (N=334).

However, subjects with baseline \nCD4 >100 cells/mm3, baseline HIV-1 RNA <5.0 log10 copies/ml, ≤ 10 prior ARVs, and/or other active \nARVs in their OB regimen were more likely to achieve a HIV-1 RNA of <400 copies/ml \n(or <50 copies/ml) on either treatment (see Table 6). \n \n\n\n\n11 \n\nTable 6 Proportion of Patients achieving <400 copies/ml and <50 copies/ml at Week 48 by \nsubgroup (pooled TORO 1 and TORO 2, ITT) \n\nSubgroups HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/ml HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml \n\nFuzeon + OB \n90 mg bid \n(N=661) \n\nOB \n(N=334) \n\nFuzeon + OB \n90 mg bid \n(N=661) \n\nOB \n(N=334) \n\nBL HIV-1 RNA < 5.0 \nlog101 copies/ml \n\n118/269  \n(43.9%) \n\n26/144  \n(18.1%) \n\n77/269  \n(28.6%) \n\n18/144  \n(12.5%) \n\nBL HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5.0 \nlog101 copies/ml \n\n83/392  \n(21.2%) \n\n14/190  \n(7.4%) \n\n44/392  \n(11.2%) \n\n8/190  \n(4.2%) \n\n     \nTotal prior ARVs ≤ \n101 \n\n100/215  \n(46.5%) \n\n29/120  \n(24.2%) \n\n64/215  \n(29.8%) \n\n19/120  \n(15.8%) \n\nTotal prior ARVs > \n101 \n\n101/446  \n(22.6%) \n\n11/214  \n(5.1%) \n\n57/446  \n(12.8%) \n\n7/214  \n(3.3%) \n\n     \n0 Active ARVs in \nbackground1,2 \n\n9/112  \n(8.0%) \n\n0/53  \n(0%) \n\n4/112  \n(3.5%) \n\n0/53  \n(0%) \n\n1 Active ARV in \nbackground1,2 \n\n56/194  \n(28.9%) \n\n7/95  \n(7.4%) \n\n34/194  \n(17.5%) \n\n3/95  \n(3.2%) \n\n≥ 2 Active ARVs in \nbackground1,2 \n\n130/344  \n(37.8%) \n\n32/183  \n(17.5%) \n\n77/334  \n(22.4%) \n\n22/183  \n(12.0%) \n\n1Discontinuations or virological failures considered as failures. \n2Based on GSS score. \n \n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of enfuvirtide have been evaluated in HIV-1-infected adult and \npaediatric patients. \n \nAbsorption: The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous administration of enfuvirtide 90 mg in the \nabdomen was 84.3 ± 15.5%. Mean (± SD) Cmax was 4.59 ± 1.5 µg/ml, AUC was 55.8 ± 12.1 µg*hr/ml \nThe subcutaneous absorption of enfuvirtide is proportional to the administered dose over the 45 to \n180 mg dose range. Subcutaneous absorption at the 90 mg dose is comparable when injected into \nabdomen, thigh or arm. In four separate studies (N = 9 to 12) the mean steady state trough plasma \nconcentration ranged from 2.6 to 3.4 µg/ml. \n \nDistribution: The steady state volume of distribution with intravenous administration of a 90 mg dose \nof enfuvirtide was 5.5 ± 1.1 l. Enfuvirtide is 92% bound to plasma proteins in HIV infected plasma \nover a plasma concentration range of 2 to 10 µg/ml. It is bound predominantly to albumin and to a \nlower extent to α-1 acid glycoprotein. In in vitro studies, enfuvirtide was not displaced from its \nbinding sites by other medicinal products, nor did enfuvirtide displace other medicinal products from \ntheir binding sites. In HIV patients, enfuvirtide levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to \nbe negligible. \n \nBiotransformation: As a peptide, enfuvirtide is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino \nacids, with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool. In vitro human microsomal \nstudies and in in vivo studies indicate that enfuvirtide is not an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. In \nin vitro human microsomal and hepatocyte studies, hydrolysis of the amide group of the C-terminus \namino acid, phenylalanine results in a deamidated metabolite and the formation of this metabolite is \nnot NADPH dependent. This metabolite is detected in human plasma following administration of \nenfuvirtide, with an AUC ranging from 2.4 to 15% of the enfuvirtide AUC.  \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\nElimination: Clearance of enfuvirtide after intravenous administration 90 mg was 1.4 ± 0.28 l/h and \nthe elimination half-life was 3.2 ± 0.42 h. Following a 90 mg subcutaneous dose of enfuvirtide the \nhalf-life of enfuvirtide is 3.8 ± 0.6 h. Mass balance studies to determine elimination pathway(s) of \nenfuvirtide have not been performed in humans.  \n \nHepatic impairment: The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have not been studied in patients with \nhepatic impairment. \n \nRenal impairment: Analysis of plasma concentration data from patients in clinical trials indicated that \nthe clearance of enfuvirtide is not affected to any clinically relevant extent in patients with mild to \nmoderate renal impairment. In a renal impairment study AUC of enfuvirtide was increased on average \nby 43-62% in patients with severe or end stage renal disease compared to patients with normal renal \nfunction. Haemodialysis did not significantly alter enfuvirtide clearance. Less than 13% of the dose \nwas removed during haemodialysis. No dose adjustment is required for patients with impaired renal \nfunction. \n \nElderly: The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have not been formally studied in elderly patients over \n65 years of age. \n \nGender and Weight: Analysis of plasma concentration data from patients in clinical trials indicated \nthat the clearance of enfuvirtide is 20% lower in females than males irrespective of weight and is \nincreased with increased body weight irrespective of gender (20% higher in a 100 kg and 20% lower \nin a 40 kg body weight patient relative to a 70 kg reference patient). However, these changes are not \nclinically significant and no dose adjustment is required. \n \nRace: Analysis of plasma concentration data from patients in clinical trials indicated that the clearance \nof enfuvirtide was not different in Afro-Americans compared to Caucasians. Other PK studies suggest \nno difference between Asians and Caucasians after adjusting exposure for body weight. \n \nPaediatric population: The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have been studied in 37 paediatric patients. \nA dose of 2 mg/kg bid (maximum 90 mg bid) provided enfuvirtide plasma concentrations similar to \nthose obtained in adult patients receiving 90 mg bid dosage. In 25 paediatric patients ranging in age \nfrom 5 to 16 years and receiving the 2 mg/kg bid dose into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen, \nthe mean steady-state AUC was 54.3 ± 23.5 µg*h/ml, Cmax was 6.14 ± 2.48 µg/ml, and Ctrough was \n2.93 ± 1.55 µg/ml. \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and late embryonal development. Long-term \nanimal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. \n \nStudies in guinea pigs indicated a potential for enfuvirtide to produce delayed contact hypersensitivity. \nIn a rat model on the resistance to influenza infection, an impairment of IFN-γ production was \nobserved. The resistance to influenza and streptococcal infection in rats was only weakly \ncompromised. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. \n \n \n6.

Patients must be instructed to \nadd the water for injections and then gently tap the vial with their fingertip until the powder begins to \ndissolve. They must never shake the vial or turn it upside down to mix—this will cause excessive \nfoaming. After the powder begins to dissolve they can set the vial aside to allow it to completely \ndissolve. The powder may take up to 45 minutes to dissolve into solution. The patient can gently roll \nthe vial between their hands after adding the water for injections until it is fully dissolved and this may \nreduce the time it takes for the powder to dissolve. Before the solution is withdrawn for \nadministration, the patient should inspect the vial visually to ensure that the contents are fully in \nsolution, and that the solution is clear and without bubbles or particulate matter. If there is evidence of \nparticulate matter, the vial must not be used and should be discarded or returned to the pharmacy. \n \nThe solvent vials contain 2 ml Water for Injections, of which 1.1 ml must be withdrawn for the \nreconstitution of the powder. Patients should be instructed to discard the remaining volume in the \nsolvent vials. \n \nFuzeon contains no preservative. Once reconstituted, the solution should be injected immediately. If \nthe reconstituted solution cannot be injected immediately, it must be kept refrigerated until use and \nused within 24 hours. Refrigerated reconstituted solution should be brought to room temperature \nbefore injection.  \n \n1 ml of the reconstituted solution should be injected subcutaneously in to the upper arm, abdomen or \nanterior thigh. The injection should be given at a site different from the preceding injection site and \nwhere there is no current injection site reaction. A vial is suitable for single use only; unused portions \nmust be discarded. \n \n \n7.

PACKAGE LEAFLET \n\n\n\n28 \n\nPackage leaflet: Information for the patient \n \n\nFuzeon 90 mg/ml powder and solvent for solution for injection \nEnfuvirtide \n\n \nRead all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains \nimportant information for you. \n• Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. \n• If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n• This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, \n\neven if their signs of illness are the same as yours. \n• If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible \n\nside effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. \n \nWhat is in this leaflet \n1. What Fuzeon is and what it is used for \n2. What you need to know before you use Fuzeon  \n3. How to use Fuzeon \n4. Possible side effects \n5. How to store Fuzeon \n6. Contents of the pack and other information \n7.  Step-by-step guide to injecting Fuzeon  \n \n \n1. What Fuzeon is and what is it used for \n \nWhat Fuzeon is \n \nFuzeon contains the active substance enfuvirtide and belongs to a group of medicines called \n‘antiretrovirals’.  \n \nWhat Fuzeon is used for \n \nFuzeon is used for the treatment of Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) - in combination with \nother antiretroviral medicines in patients infected with HIV. \n• Your doctor has prescribed Fuzeon to help control your HIV infection. \n• Fuzeon is not a cure for HIV infection. \n \nHow Fuzeon works \nHIV attacks cells in your blood called CD4 or T-cells. The virus needs to make contact with, and get \ninside these cells in order for the virus to multiply. Fuzeon helps by preventing this. \n \n \n2. What you need to know before you use Fuzeon \n \nDo not use Fuzeon if \n• you are allergic to enfuvirtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section \n\n6). \nIf you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fuzeon. \n \nWarnings and precautions \n \nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fuzeon if: \n• you have ever had any lung problems \n• you have ever had any kidney problems \n\n\n\n29 \n\n• you have chronic hepatitis B or C or another liver disease - you are more likely to get serious \nliver problems while using this medicine   \n\n \nSigns of previous infections \nIn some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections, signs \nand symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is \nstarted. It is believed that these symptoms are due to a recovery of the body’s immune system. This \nimprovement enables the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious \nsymptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. \n \nSigns of autoimmune disorders  \nIn addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the \nimmune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the \ntreatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of \ntreatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, \nweakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, \ntremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. \n \nPatients with liver disease \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti-HIV therapy are at an increased risk for \nserious liver problems. Speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. \n \nBone disease (osteonecrosis) \nSome patients taking combination anti-HIV medicines may develop a bone disease called \nosteonecrosis. This is where the bone tissue dies because the blood supply has been lost (death of bone \ntissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  \n\n \n Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and \nshoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these signs please inform your \ndoctor. \n \n Risk factors for developing this disease include: how long you have been taking anti-HIV \nmedicines, whether you take corticosteroids, how much alcohol you drink, how well your \nimmune system works and being overweight.  \n\n \nPassing HIV to others \nYou can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective \nantiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other \npeople. \nOther medicines and Fuzeon \nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Fuzeon has \nbeen shown not to interact with your other anti-HIV medicines or rifampicin (an antibiotic). \n \nFuzeon with food and drink \nYou can use Fuzeon with or without food. However, you still need to follow the instructions given in \nthe package leaflets for the other medicines you are taking. \n \nPregnancy and breast-feeding \n• If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor \n\nfor advice before taking this medicine. You should not use Fuzeon unless specifically told to by \nyour doctor.  \n\n• Do not breast-feed if you have HIV because HIV may be passed on to the baby.  \n \nDriving and using machines \nFuzeon has not been tested for its effect on your ability to drive a car or use tools or machines. If you \nfeel dizzy while using Fuzeon do not drive or use any tools or machines. \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \nFuzeon contains sodium \nFuzeon contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. \n \n \n3. How to use Fuzeon \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor \nor pharmacist if you are not sure.  \n \nHow to prepare and inject Fuzeon \nFuzeon must be given as an injection just below the skin – called a ‘subcutaneous’ injection. Section 7 \ntells you how to prepare Fuzeon and how to give yourself an injection. \n \nHow much to use \n• The recommended dose is 90 mg twice a day for adults and adolescents (16 years and older).  \n• This is given as a 1 ml injection just below the skin. \n• It is best to use Fuzeon at the same time each day. \n• Try and space the doses evenly apart at times which are good for you – for example, first thing \nin the morning and then in the early evening. \n \nSee further instructions on how to use Fuzeon at the end of this leaflet (see Section 7). There you will \nfind instructions on how to prepare Fuzeon and how to give yourself an injection. \n \nIf you use more Fuzeon than you should \nIf you use more Fuzeon than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the \nmedicine pack with you.  \n \nIf you forget to use Fuzeon \n• If you forget to use a dose, use it as soon as you remember it. However if it is less than 6 hours \n\nbefore you are going to take your next regular dose, skip the missed dose. \n• Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. \n \nIf you stop using Fuzeon \n• Keep using your medicine until your doctor tells you to stop. If you stop and there is a gap in \n\nyour treatment this may speed up the chances of the HIV in your blood becoming resistant to \nFuzeon. This is less likely if you use it regularly and without gaps in treatment. \n\n• The HIV virus in your blood may eventually become resistant to Fuzeon. If this happens, your \nblood levels of virus may begin to rise. This is when your doctor may decide to no longer keep \ntreating you with Fuzeon. Your doctor should discuss this with you at that time. \n\n \nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \n \n4. Possible side effects \n \nLike all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  \n \nStop using Fuzeon and see a doctor straight away, if you notice any of the following serious side \neffects – you may need urgent medical treatment: \n• Allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) – signs may include: rash, a high temperature or chills, \n\nfeeling or being sick, sweating or shaking. \nThis side effect is rare (affects less than 1 in 1,000 people). These signs do not definitely mean you are \nallergic to this medicine.  \n \n\n\n\n31 \n\nTell your doctor if you get side effects where the injection is given \nThe most common side effects (affect more than 1 in 10 people), are problems at the place on your \nbody where you have the injection. You will probably have one or more of the following mild to \nmoderate reactions:  \n\n● redness \n● swelling \n● feeling itchy  \n● bruises \n● hardened skin or bumps \n● pain, feeling sore or tender \n\nThese reactions can appear in the first week of treatment and usually only last for up to 7 days. They \ngenerally do not get worse after this time. If you have any of these reactions do not stop using Fuzeon, \nbut talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. \n \nReactions may be worse when injections are repeated in the same place on the body. They may also be \nworse when the injection is given deeper than intended (for example, into a muscle). Rarely, you may \nget an infection at a place where an individual injection was given. To reduce the risk of infection, it is \nimportant that you follow the instructions provided in Section 7. \n \nFuzeon can cause a build-up of a type of protein, called amyloid, under the skin at the injection site. \nThis may feel like lumps under the skin. Please contact your doctor if this occurs. \nOther possible side effects \n \nVery common (affects more than 1 in 10 people)  \n\n• diarrhoea \n• feeling sick \n• weight loss \n• pain and feeling numb in hands, feet or legs. \n\n \nCommon (affects less than 1 in 10 people)  \n• pneumonia  \n• ear infection  \n• swollen glands (lymph nodes) \n• inflamed eye (conjunctivitis) \n• flu or ‘flu-like’ symptoms \n• inflamed sinuses \n• nasal congestion \n• anorexia  \n• heart burn \n• inflamed pancreas \n• decreased appetite \n• diabetes,  \n• nightmares  \n• feeling dizzy \n• shaking (tremor) \n• feeling anxious or irritated \n• not being able to concentrate \n• decreased sensation  \n• acne \n• redness of the skin \n• eczema   \n• dry skin \n• warts \n• muscle pain  \n• kidney stones \n\n\n\n32 \n\n• feeling weak \n• blood in the urine  \n• changes shown in blood tests (increased blood fat) \n \nReporting of side effects \nIf you get anyside effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side \neffects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting \nsystem listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the \nsafety of this medicine. \n \n \n5. How to store Fuzeon \n \nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \n \nDo not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label of either the Fuzeon or the \nWater for Injections Vials after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.  \n \nKeep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. \n \nOnce the solution has been prepared for your injection it should be used immediately. If it is not used \nstraight away it must be stored in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C) and used within 24 hours.  \n \nDo not use this medicine if you notice any particles in the powder or the solution once the water for \ninjection has been added. Also do not use the Water for Injections if you see any particles in the vial or \nif the water is cloudy. \n \nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \n \n \n6.

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO INJECTING FUZEON  \n \nAlways use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. You should check with \nyour doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  \n \nWhat to do if you are left-handed \nThe pictures in this leaflet show people who are right-handed. If you are left-handed, do what comes \nnaturally to you. You will probably find it most comfortable to: \n\n• hold the syringe in your left hand and  \n• hold the vial between the thumb and forefinger of your right hand. \n \n\nWhen to have someone to help you \nIt may be difficult at first to inject in some places, such as the upper arms. If you need help, ask your \npartner, a friend, or a family member. You may like to ask someone to come with you to an injection \ntraining session with your doctor or nurse. \n \nYour syringes \nThe syringes supplied with this medicine have a coloured needle protector. This is attached to the \nneedle and covers it after use to lower the risk of the needle accidently pricking another person. \n\n\n\n35 \n\nAlthough these syringes have this safety feature, it is still important that you dispose of used syringes \nproperly. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n \nSafety Tips \n \n● Wash your hands well. This will reduce the risk of bacterial infections.  \n \n● Once you have washed your hands, do not touch anything except the medicine and supplies. \n \n● When handling the syringe, do not touch the needle.  \n \n● Do not touch the tops of the vials once they have been cleaned with alcohol swabs. \n \n● Do not use opened materials. Make sure none of the items in your kit have been opened before \n\nuse.  \n \n● Never use or share used needles. \n \n● Never use a syringe with a bent or damaged needle. \n \n● Never mix your medicine with tap water. \n \n● Never inject your medicine with other injectable medicines. \n \n● Only inject Fuzeon under the skin (‘subcutaneous’). \n  \n● Do not inject Fuzeon into your veins (‘intravenously’) or into your muscles (‘intramuscularly’). \n \n● Dispose of all used materials into your special waste container with a lid. Do this even if the \n\nvials contain unused amounts of medicine or Water for Injections as these are for single use \nonly. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions about safe disposal of \nthese items. \n\n \nThe following is a basic, step-by-step guide to injecting your medicine. \n \n\nStep A: Getting Started \n \n1. Get the following things together:  \n- One vial of Fuzeon (glass container with white powder inside) \n- One vial of Water for Injections (glass container with clear and colourless liquid inside) \n- One 3 ml syringe (larger syringe) with a 25 mm needle \n- One 1 ml syringe (smaller syringe) with a 13 mm needle \n- Three alcohol swabs \n- Special waste container with a lid for the safe disposal of the waste materials.  \n2. Open syringe packs and take off vial caps. \n- Dispose of packaging and vial caps into your special waste container with a lid. \n- Place syringes and vials onto a clean surface. \n3. Wash hands thoroughly. \n- After washing your hands, do not touch anything except the injection supplies and where the \n\ninjection will be given. \n4. Clean the tops of the vials. \n- Wipe each vial top with a fresh alcohol pad. Let the tops dry in the air. \n- Make sure you do not touch the rubber tops after cleaning them. If you touch them, make sure \n\nyou clean them again. \n \n\n\n\n36 \n\nStep B: Mixing Fuzeon \n \nDraw Up Water for Injections \n \n1. Pick up the 3 ml large syringe. Using your index finger, move the coloured needle protector away \nfrom the needle. \n \n\n \n \n2. To make sure that the needle is firmly on the syringe: \n• hold the plastic cap under the needle protector  \n• tighten the needle and cap with a gentle clockwise twist. Do not use too much force as the \nneedle may loosen. \n \n3. To remove the clear plastic cap: \n• push towards the syringe and then pull the cap off.  \n \n\n \n \n4. Draw back 1.1 ml of air. \n \n5. Push the syringe needle into the rubber top of the vial of Water for Injections and press the plunger. \nThis injects the air.  \n \n\n \n \n6. Gently turn the vial upside down. Make sure the tip of the needle is always below the surface of \nthe Water for Injections to help keep any air bubbles from entering the syringe. \n \n\n\n\n37 \n\n7. Slowly pull back the plunger until the water reaches the 1.1 ml mark. Please be aware that the vial \ncontains more liquid than you need (2 ml); you only have to pull out 1.1 ml to prepare your \ninjection properly. \n \n\n \n \n8. Tap the syringe gently to make any air bubbles rise to the top. \n \n• If too much air gets into the syringe, gently press the plunger to force any air back into the vial. \n• Then pull out the water again. \n• Make sure you have 1.1 ml of Water for Injections in the syringe.  \n• This step may be repeated until the correct amount of Water for Injections is in the syringe. \n \n9. Take out the needle from the vial. Make sure you never touch the needle with your fingers or \nanything else. \n \n10. Dispose of the vial and the Water for Injections into your special waste container with a lid - this \nvial is for single use only.  \nInjecting Water For Injections Into Fuzeon Powder \n \n1. Gently tap the vial of Fuzeon to loosen the powder. \n \n2. Hold the main part of the water-filled syringe and push the needle through the rubber top of the vial \nat a slight angle. \n \n3. Press the syringe plunger in slowly.  \n• Let the water flow slowly down the inside of the vial.  \n• Be careful not to forcefully shoot water into the powder, since this can cause foaming. \n• If foaming happens, it may take longer for the powder to dissolve completely. \n \n\n \n \n4. After all of the Water for Injections has been added to the vial of Fuzeon, take out the syringe from \nthe vial.  \n \n\n\n\n38 \n\n5. Hold the main part of the syringe with one hand and gently press the coloured needle protector \ndown on a flat surface until it covers the needle.  \n - You will hear a click. Do not use your free hand to press the device over the needle. \n \n\n    \n \n6. Throw away the syringe into the special waste container with a lid. \n \nMixing the Water for Injections with the Fuzeon Powder \n \n1. Gently tap the vial with your fingertip until the powder begins to dissolve. Never shake the vial or \nturn it upside down to mix—this will cause too much foaming.  \n \n2.  When the powder begins to dissolve you can put the vial aside to allow it to completely dissolve.  \n - The powder may take up to 45 minutes to dissolve into solution.  \n - The vial can also be gently rolled between your hands after adding the Water for Injections \n\nuntil it is fully dissolved.  \n - This may reduce the time it takes for the powder to dissolve. \n \n3. After the powder has dissolved completely  \n - Let any bubbles that may have formed settle.  \n - If the bubbles are still there, gently tap the side of the vial to help settle them. \n \n4 It is important to check the liquid for bits (particles).  \n - If you see any bits in the liquid, do not use it.  \n - Dispose of the vial into the special waste container with a lid or return it to the pharmacy. \nThen start again with a new vial of Fuzeon powder. \n \n5. If you accidentally touch the rubber stopper, make sure to clean it again with a new alcohol swab \n \n6. Once a dose is mixed with Water for Injections, it must be used straight away. If not, store in a \nrefrigerator and use within 24 hours.  \n - Let the liquid get back to  room temperature before using. \n \n7. If you are preparing both of your daily doses at one time, make sure to use new syringes, Water for \nInjections, and Fuzeon for each dose. \n \n\n\n\n39 \n\nStep C: Preparing for the injection \n \n\n \nDrawing up Fuzeon into the 1 ml syringe \n \n1. Wipe the top of the Fuzeon vial again with a new alcohol swab. \n \n2. Pick up the 1 ml small syringe. Using your index finger, move back the coloured needle protector \naway from the needle. \n \n\n \n \n3. To make sure that the needle is firmly on the syringe: \n• hold the plastic cap under the needle protector \n• tighten the needle and cap by slightly turning and pushing it towards the syringe. \n \n4. To remove the clear plastic cap: \n• push towards the syringe and then pull the cap off. \n \n\n \n \n5. Draw back 1 ml of air.  \n - Be careful not to pull the plunger too fast - it may go past the 1 ml marker or out of the syringe. \n \n6. Push the syringe needle into the rubber top of the Fuzeon vial and press the plunger. This injects the \nair.  \n \n7. Gently turn the vial upside down.  \n \nMake sure the tip of the needle is always below the surface of the solution to help keep air \nbubbles from entering the syringe.  \n \n8. Slowly pull back the plunger until the solution reaches the 1.0 ml mark.  \n- Be careful not to pull the plunger too fast - it may go past the 1 ml marker or out of the syringe. \n \n\n \n \n9. Tap the syringe gently to make any air bubbles rise to the top. \n \n- If too much air enters the syringe, gently press the plunger to force the air back into the vial.  \n\n\n\n40 \n\n- Then pull out the liquid again. \n- Make sure you have 1.0 ml of liquid in the syringe (or whatever amount your doctor prescribed, if it \nis different).  \n- This step may be repeated until the correct amount of solution is in the syringe. \n \n10. Take out the syringe from the vial. \n \n\nStep D: Injecting Fuzeon \n \nTip: Your doctor or nurse may suggest different injection techniques that will work best for you. \n \nWhere to Inject \n \n\n \n \n• Fuzeon is given as a 1 ml injection just below the skin – called a ‘subcutaneous’ injection. \n• You can inject into your upper arm, upper thigh or stomach area (abdomen). \n• Choose a different area from where you last injected yourself. \n• Do not inject to a place where there is still a reaction from an earlier dose. Check for any places \n\nwhere you may have a reaction by pressing the skin to see if there are any hard bumps.  \n• Do not inject into areas that could become irritated by your belt or the waistline of your clothes. \n• Do not inject into moles, scar tissue, bruises or your belly button (navel). \n \nCleansing the injection site \nClean the area for injection well with an alcohol swab. Do this in a circular motion, starting in the \nmiddle and working outward. Allow it to dry in the air completely. \n \nPutting in the needle and injecting \n \n1. Pinch as much of a skin fold as possible - without making yourself uncomfortable. \n \n\n \n \n2. Push the needle into the skin at a 45-degree angle. \n \n\n \n \n3. When the needle is in:  \n-  release the skin \n-  use this free hand to hold on to the main part of the syringe – this will help steady it and stop it from \nmoving. \n \n\n\n\n41 \n\n4. Using the thumb of your other hand, press the plunger to inject the liquid. \n \n - After the dose is fully delivered, remove the needle from the skin.  \n \nAfter pulling out the needle \n \n1. Hold the main part of the syringe with one hand  \n- then gently press the coloured needle protector down on a flat surface until it covers the needle.  \n- you will hear a click.  \nDo not use your free hand to press the protector over the needle. \n \n\n    \n \n2. Dispose of the syringe into a special waste container with a lid. \n \n3. If there is any blood where you have given the injection, cover the skin with a sticking plaster. \n \n\n \nStep E: Disposing of used supplies \n\n- Dispose of all used items straight into the special waste container with a lid. Do this even if the vials \ncontain unused amounts of medicine or Water for Injections as these are for single use only. \n- Keep the cover of this container tight and keep it out of the reach of children.  \n- Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper disposal of the container. \n \n. If you have any questions or concerns about the safe disposal of these materials, please talk to your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse. \n\n \n \n\n\n\tSUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS\n\tA.
