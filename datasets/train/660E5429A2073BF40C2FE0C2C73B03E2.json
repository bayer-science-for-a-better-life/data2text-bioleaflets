NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCRIXIVAN 200 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains indinavir sulphate corresponding to 200 mg of indinavir. \n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach 200 mg capsule contains 74.8 mg lactose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nThe capsules are semi\u2013translucent white and coded \u2018CRIXIVAN \u2122 200 mg\u2019 in blue. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCRIXIVAN is indicated in combination with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues for the treatment of \nHIV\u20131 infected adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nCRIXIVAN should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection. On the basis of current pharmacodynamic data, indinavir must be used in combination with \nother antiretroviral agents. When indinavir is administered as monotherapy resistant viruses rapidly \nemerge (see section 5.1).\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of indinavir is 800 mg orally every 8 hours.\n\nData from published studies suggest that CRIXIVAN 400 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg, \nboth administered orally twice daily, may be an alternative dosing regimen. The suggestion is based \non limited published data (see section 5.2).\n\nA dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when administering \nitraconazole or ketoconazole concurrently (see section 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild\u2013to\u2013moderate hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis, the dose of indinavir should \nbe reduced to 600 mg every 8 hours. The recommendation is based on limited pharmacokinetic data \n(see section 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied; therefore, no dosing \nrecommendations can be made (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nSafety in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied; however, less than 20 % of \nindinavir is excreted in the urine as unchanged medicinal product or metabolites (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\n\n\n3\n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of CRIXIVAN in children under the age of 4 years have not been established \n(see section 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data in children above the age of 4 years are described in \nsections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.\n\nMethod of administration\nThe hard capsules should be swallowed whole.\n\nSince CRIXIVAN must be taken at intervals of 8 hours, a schedule convenient for the patient should \nbe developed. For optimal absorption, CRIXIVAN should be administered without food but with \nwater 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Alternatively, CRIXIVAN may be administered with a \nlow\u2013fat, light meal.\n\nIf co-administered with ritonavir, CRIXIVAN may be administered with or without food.\n\nTo ensure adequate hydration, it is recommended that adults drink at least 1.5 litres of liquids during \nthe course of 24 hours.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nIndinavir with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with medicinal products \nwith narrow therapeutic windows and which are substrates of CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by \nboth CRIXIVAN and ritonavir could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these medicines, \npotentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions (see section 4.5).\n\nCRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with amiodarone, \nterfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, quetiapine, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam administered orally \n(for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), pimozide, ergot derivatives, \nsimvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.4).\n\nCombination of rifampicin with CRIXIVAN with or without concomitant low-dose ritonavir is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). Concurrent use of indinavir with herbal preparations containing St \nJohn\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).\n\nIn addition, indinavir with ritonavir must not be administered with alfuzosin, meperidine, piroxicam, \npropoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, flecanide, propafenone, quinidine, fusidic acid, clozapine, \nclorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam.\n\nIndinavir must not be given with ritonavir to patients with decompensated liver disease as ritonavir is \nprincipally metabolized and eliminated by the liver (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen CRIXIVAN is used with ritonavir, consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of ritonavir \nfor additional contraindications.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nNephrolithiasis and tubulointerstitial nephritis\nNephrolithiasis has occurred with indinavir therapy in adult patients with a cumulative frequency of \n12.4 % (range across individual trials: 4.7 % to 34.4 %). The cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis \nevents increases with increasing exposure to CRIXIVAN; however, the risk over time remains \nrelatively constant. In some cases, nephrolithiasis has been associated with renal insufficiency or \nacute renal failure; in the majority of these cases renal insufficiency and acute renal failure were \nreversible. If signs and symptoms of nephrolithiasis, including flank pain with or without haematuria \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\n(including microscopic haematuria) occur, temporary interruption of therapy (e.g. for 1\u20133 days) \nduring the acute episode of nephrolithiasis or discontinuation of therapy may be considered. \nEvaluation may consist of urinalysis, serum BUN and creatinine, and ultrasound of the bladder and \nkidneys. Adequate hydration is recommended in all patients on indinavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nMedical management in patients with one or more episodes of nephrolithiasis must include adequate \nhydration and may include temporary interruption of therapy (e.g., 1 to 3 days) during the acute \nepisode of nephrolithiasis or discontinuation of therapy.\n\nCases of interstitial nephritis with medullary calcification and cortical atrophy have been observed in \npatients with asymptomatic severe leucocyturia (> 100 cells/high power field). In patients at increased \nrisk, urinary screening should be considered. If persistent severe leucocyturia is found, further \ninvestigation might be warranted.\n\nMedicinal products interactions\nIndinavir should be used cautiously with other medicinal products that are potent inducers of \nCYP3A4. Co\u2013administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of indinavir and as a \nconsequence an increased risk for suboptimal treatment and facilitation of development of resistance \n(see section 4.5).\n\nIf indinavir is given with ritonavir, the potential interaction may be increased. The Interactions section \nof the SPC for ritonavir should also be consulted for information about potential interactions.\n\nAtazanavir as well as indinavir are associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia due to \ninhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Combinations of atazanavir with or without \nritonavir and Crixivan have not been studied and co-administration of these medicinal products is not \nrecommended due to risk of worsening of these adverse reactions.\n\nConcomitant use of indinavir with lovastatin or simvastatin is not recommended due to an increased \nrisk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Based on an interaction study with lopinavir/ritonavir, \ncombination of rosuvastatin and protease inhibitors is not recommended.  Caution must also be \nexercised if indinavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin.  The interaction of indinavir or \nindinavir/ritonavir with pravastatin or fluvastatin is not known (see section 4.5).\n\nCo\u2013administration of CRIXIVAN with sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil (PDE5 inhibitors) are \nexpected to substantially increase the plasma concentrations of these compounds and may result in an \nincrease in PDE5 inhibitor\u2013associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and \npriapism (see section 4.5).\n\nHIV Transmission\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nAcute haemolytic anaemia\nAcute haemolytic anaemia has been reported which in some cases was severe and progressed rapidly. \nOnce a diagnosis is apparent, appropriate measures for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia should be \ninstituted which may include discontinuation of indinavir.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nLiver disease\nThe safety and efficacy of indinavir has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product \ninformation for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\nAn increased incidence of nephrolithiasis has been observed in patients with underlying liver \ndisorders when treated with indinavir.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \nfactor VIII was given. In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \nre-introduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been evoked, although the \nmechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware \nof the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nPatients with mild\u2013to\u2013moderate hepatic insufficiency due to cirrhosis will require a dose reduction of \nindinavir due to decreased metabolism of indinavir (see section 4.2). Patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment have not been studied. In the absence of such studies, caution should be exercised as \nincreased levels of indinavir may occur.\n\nSafety in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied; however, less than 20 % of \nindinavir is excreted in the urine as unchanged medicinal product or metabolites (see section 4.2).\n\nOsteonecrosis:\nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nLactose\nThis medicinal product contains 299.2 mg of lactose in each 800 mg dose (maximum single dose). \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe metabolism of indinavir is mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Therefore, other \nsubstances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the \npharmacokinetics of indinavir. Similarly, indinavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other \nsubstances that share this metabolic pathway. Boosted indinavir (indinavir with ritonavir) may have \nadditive pharmacokinetic effects on substances that share the CYP3A4 pathway as both ritonavir and \nindinavir inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.\n\nIndinavir with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with medicinal products \nwith narrow therapeutic windows and which are substrates of CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by \nboth CRIXIVAN and ritonavir could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these medicines, \npotentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions. CRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir should \nnot be administered concurrently with amiodarone, terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, quetiapine, \nalprazolam, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered \nmidazolam, see Table 1 and 2 below), pimozide, ergot derivatives, simvastatin or lovastatin. In \naddition, indinavir with ritonavir should not be administered with alfuzosin, meperidine, piroxicam, \npropoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, flecanide, propafenone, quinidine, fusidic acid, clozapine, \nclorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam.\n\nConcurrent use of indinavir with rifampicin or herbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) is contraindicated.\n\nMedicinal products listed above are not repeated in Table 1 and 2 unless specific interaction data is \navailable.\n\nRefer also to sections 4.2 and 4.3.\n\nTable 1. Interactions and dose recommendations with other medical products \u2013 UNBOOSTED \nINDINAVIR\n\nInteractions between indinavir and other medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is \nindicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change (\u2264 +/- 20 %) as \u201c\u2194\u201d, single dose as \u201cSD\u201d, once daily as \n\u201cQD\u201d, twice daily as \u201cBID\u201d, three times daily as \u201cTID\u201d, and four times daily as \"QID\").\n\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction Recommendations \nconcerning co-\nadministration\n\nANTI-INFECTIVES\nAntiretrovirals\nNRTIs\nDidanosine \nFormulation with buffer\n\nNo formal interaction study has been \nperformed.

Indinavir should be used \nduring pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Given that \nsubstantially lower antepartum exposures have been observed in a small study of HIV-infected \npregnant patients and the limited data in this patient population, indinavir use is not recommended in \nHIV-infected pregnant patients (see section 5.2). \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia, reported predominantly as elevated indirect bilirubin, has occurred in 14 % of \npatients during treatment with indinavir. Because it is unknown whether indinavir will exacerbate \nphysiologic hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates, careful consideration must be given to the use of \nindinavir in pregnant women at the time of delivery (see section 4.8).\n\nIn Rhesus monkeys, administration of indinavir to neonates caused a mild exacerbation of the \ntransient physiologic hyperbilirubinaemia seen in this species after birth. Administration of indinavir \nto pregnant Rhesus monkeys during the third trimester did not cause a similar exacerbation in \nneonates; however, only limited placental transfer of indinavir occurred.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is recommended that HIV\uf02dinfected women do not breast\uf02dfeed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. It is not known whether indinavir is excreted in \nhuman milk. Mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast\uf02dfeeding during treatment. \n\nFertility\nThere are no data available regarding potential effects of CRIXIVAN treatment on male or female \nfertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

Many of these adverse reactions were also identified \nas common pre\u2013existing or frequently occurring medical conditions in this population. These adverse \nreactions were: nausea (35.3 %), headache (25.2 %), diarrhoea (24.6 %), asthenia/fatigue (24.3 %), \nrash (19.1 %), taste perversion (19.1 %), dry skin (16.2 %), abdominal pain (14.6 %), vomiting \n(11.0 %), dizziness (10.7 %). With the exception of dry skin, rash, and taste perversion, the incidence \nof clinical adverse reactions was similar or higher among patients treated with antiretroviral \nnucleoside analogue controls than among patients treated with CRIXIVAN monotherapy or in \ncombination with NRTI(s). This overall safety profile remained similar for 107 patients treated with \nCRIXIVAN monotherapy or in combination with NRTI(s) for up to 48 weeks. Adverse reactions, \nincluding nephrolithiasis, may lead to treatment interruption.\n\n \n\n\n\n18\n\nIn controlled clinical trials conducted world\u2013wide, indinavir was administered alone or in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents (zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, and/or lamivudine) to \napproximately 2,000 patients, the majority of whom were adult Caucasian males (15 % females).\n\nIndinavir did not alter the type, frequency, or severity of known major adverse effects associated with \nthe use of zidovudine, didanosine, or lamivudine.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies in adults and/or post-\nmarketing use for CRIXIVAN monotherapy and/or CRIXIVAN with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy (CART).\n\nVery common (\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \uf03c 1/1,000); Very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \navailable data).

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nNephrolithiasis\nNephrolithiasis, including flank pain with or without haematuria (including microscopic haematuria), \nhas been reported in approximately 10 % (252/2,577) of patients receiving CRIXIVAN in clinical \ntrials at the recommended dose compared to 2.2 % in the control arms. In general, these events were \nnot associated with renal dysfunction and resolved with hydration and temporary interruption of \ntherapy (e.g., 1\u20133 days).\n\nHyperbilirubinaemia \nIsolated asymptomatic hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin \uf0b3 2.5 mg/dL, 43 mcmol/L) was reported \npredominantly as elevated indirect bilirubin and rarely associated with elevations in ALT, AST, or \n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\nalkaline phosphatase, has occurred in approximately 14 % of patients treated with CRIXIVAN alone \nor in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Most patients continued treatment with CRIXIVAN\nwithout dose reduction and bilirubin values gradually declined toward baseline. Hyperbilirubinaemia \noccurred more frequently at doses exceeding 2.4 g/day compared to doses less than 2.4 g/day. \n\nPaediatric population\nIn clinical trials in paediatric patients (\u2265 3 years), the adverse reaction profile was similar to that for \nadult patients except for a higher frequency of nephrolithiasis of 29 % (20/70) in paediatric patients \ntreated with CRIXIVAN. Asymptomatic pyuria of unknown etiology was noted in 10.9 % (6/55) of \npaediatric patients who received CRIXIVAN. Some of these events were associated with mild \nelevation of serum creatinine.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of human overdose with CRIXIVAN. The most commonly reported \nsymptoms were gastro-intestinal (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and renal (e.g., nephrolithiasis, \nflank pain, haematuria).\n\nIt is not known whether indinavir is dialyzable by peritoneal or haemodialysis. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitor, ATC code JO5AE02\n\nMechanism of action\nIndinavir inhibits recombinant HIV\u20131 and HIV\u20132 protease with an approximate tenfold selectivity for \nHIV\u20131 over HIV\u20132 proteinase. Indinavir binds reversibly to the protease active site and inhibits \ncompetitively the enzyme, thereby preventing cleavage of the viral precursor polyproteins that occurs \nduring maturation of the newly formed viral particle. The resulting immature particles are non\u2013\ninfectious and are incapable of establishing new cycles of infection. Indinavir did not significantly \ninhibit the eukaryotic proteases human renin, human cathepsin D, human elastase, and human factor \nXa.\n\nMicrobiology\nIndinavir at concentrations of 50 to 100 nM mediated 95 % inhibition (IC95) of viral spread (relative \nto an untreated virus\u2013infected control) in human T\u2013lymphoid cell cultures and primary human \nmonocytes/macrophages infected with HIV\uf02d1 variants LAI, MN, RF, and a macrophage\u2013tropic \nvariant SF\u2013162, respectively. Indinavir at concentrations of 25 to 100 nM mediated 95 % inhibition of \nviral spread in cultures of mitogen\u2013activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with \ndiverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV\uf02d1, including isolates resistant to zidovudine and non\u2013\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed \nwhen human T\u2013lymphoid cells infected with the LAI variant of HIV\u20131 were incubated with indinavir \nand either zidovudine, didanosine, or NNRTIs.\n\nMedicinal product resistance\nLoss of suppression of viral RNA levels occurred in some patients; however, CD4 cell counts were \noften sustained above pre\u2013treatment levels. When loss of viral RNA suppression occurred, it was \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n21\n\ntypically associated with replacement of circulating susceptible virus with resistant viral variants. \nResistance was correlated with the accumulation of mutations in the viral genome that resulted in the \nexpression of amino acid substitutions in the viral protease.\n\nAt least eleven amino acid sites in the protease have been associated with indinavir resistance: L10, \nK20, L24, M46, I54, L63, I64, A71, V82, I84, and L90. The basis for their contributions to resistance, \nhowever, is complex. None of these substitutions was either necessary or sufficient for resistance. For \nexample, no single substitution or pair of substitutions was capable of engendering measurable \n(\uf0b3 four\u2013fold) resistance to indinavir, and the level of resistance was dependent on the ways in which \nmultiple substitutions were combined. In general, however, higher levels of resistance resulted from \nthe co\u2013expression of greater numbers of substitutions at the eleven identified positions. Among \npatients experiencing viral RNA rebound during indinavir monotherapy at 800 mg q8h, substitutions \nat only three of these sites were observed in the majority of patients: V82 (to A or F), M46 (to I or L), \nand L10 (to I or R). Other substitutions were observed less frequently. The observed amino acid \nsubstitutions appeared to accumulate sequentially and in no consistent order, probably as a result of \nongoing viral replication.\n\nIt should be noted that the decrease in suppression of viral RNA levels was seen more frequently \nwhen therapy with indinavir was initiated at doses lower than the recommended oral dose of \n2.4 g/day. Therefore, therapy with indinavir should be initiated at the recommended dose to \nincrease suppression of viral replication and therefore inhibit the emergence of resistant virus.\n\nThe concomitant use of indinavir with nucleoside analogues (to which the patient is naive) may lessen \nthe risk of the development of resistance to both indinavir and the nucleoside analogues. In one \ncomparative trial, combination therapy with nucleoside analogues (triple therapy with zidovudine plus\ndidanosine) conferred protection against the selection of virus expressing at least one resistance\u2013\nassociated amino acid substitution to both indinavir (from 13/24 to 2/20 at therapy week 24) and to \nthe nucleoside analogues (from 10/16 to 0/20 at therapy week 24).\n\nCross resistance\nHIV\uf02d1 patient isolates with reduced susceptibility to indinavir expressed varying patterns and degrees \nof cross\u2013resistance to a series of diverse HIV PIs, including ritonavir and saquinavir. Complete \ncross\uf02dresistance was noted between indinavir and ritonavir; however, cross\uf02dresistance to saquinavir \nvaried among isolates. Many of the protease amino acid substitutions reported to be associated with \nresistance to ritonavir and saquinavir were also associated with resistance to indinavir.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAdults\nTreatment with indinavir alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents (i.e., nucleoside \nanalogues) has so far been documented to reduce viral load and increase CD4 lymphocytes in patients \nwith CD4 cell counts below 500 cells/mm3.\n\nIn one published study, 20 HIV-infected patients with undetectable plasma viral load \n(< 200 copies/mL) receiving indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours were switched in an open, cross-over \ndesign to indinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg every 12 hours. Eighteen patients completed the study to \nweek 48. Viral load remained < 200 copies/mL for 48 weeks in all patients. \n\nAnother published study evaluated the efficacy and safety of indinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg every \n12 hours in 40 antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients. Thirty subjects completed 48 weeks of treatment. At \nweek 4, the indinavir Cmin was 500 ng/mL with substantial trough variability (range 5 to \n8,100 ng/mL). By intent to treat analysis 65 % of patients had HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL and 50 % \nhad viral load < 50 copies/mL; by on-treatment analysis 96 % of patients had HIV RNA \n< 400 copies/mL and 74 % had viral load < 50 copies/mL.\n\n \n\n\n\n22\n\nEighty antiretroviral na\u00efve patients were entered into a third published study. In this open label non-\nrandomized single arm study, patients were treated with stavudine and lamivudine plus \nindinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg every 12 hours. Sixty-two patients completed the study to week 96. In \nthe intent to treat and on treatment analyses the proportion of patients with HIV RNA of \n< 50 copies/mL was 68.8 % and 88.7 %, respectively, at week 96.\n\nIndinavir alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues (zidovudine/stavudine and lamivudine) \nhas been shown to delay clinical progression rate compared with nucleoside analogues and to provide \na sustained effect on viral load and CD4 count.\n\nIn zidovudine experienced patients, indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine in combination compared \nwith lamivudine added to zidovudine reduced the probability of AIDS defining illness or death \n(ADID) at 48 weeks from 13 % to 7 %. Similarly, in antiretroviral naive patients, indinavir with and \nwithout zidovudine compared with zidovudine alone reduced the probability of ADID at 48 weeks \nfrom 15 % with zidovudine alone to approximately 6 % with indinavir alone or in combination with \nzidovudine.\n\nEffects on viral load were consistently more pronounced in patients treated with indinavir in \ncombination with nucleoside analogues, but the proportion of patients with serum viral RNA below \nthe limit of quantification (500 copies/mL) varied between studies, at week 24 from 40 % to more \nthan 80 %. This proportion tends to remain stable over prolonged periods of follow\u2013up. Similarly, \neffects on CD4 cell count tend to be more pronounced in patients treated with indinavir in \ncombination with nucleoside analogues compared with indinavir alone. Within studies, this effect is \nsustained also after prolonged periods of follow\u2013up.\n\nPaediatric population\nTwo clinical trials in 41 paediatric patients (4 to 15 years of age) were designed to characterise the \nsafety, antiretroviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of indinavir in combination with stavudine and \nlamivudine. In one study, at week 24, the proportion of patients with plasma viral RNA below \n400 copies/mL was 60 %; the mean increase in CD4 cell counts was 242 cells/mm3; and the mean \nincrease in percent CD4 cell counts was 4.2 %. At week 60, the proportion of patients with plasma \nviral RNA below 400 copies/mL was 59 %. In another study, at week 16, the proportion of patients \nwith plasma viral RNA below 400 copies/mL was 59 %; the mean increase in CD4 cell counts was \n73 cells/mm3; and the mean increase in percent CD4 cell counts was 1.2 %. At week 24, the \nproportion of patients with plasma viral RNA below 400 copies/mL was 60 %.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nIndinavir is rapidly absorbed in the fasted state with a time to peak plasma concentration of 0.8 hours \n\u00b1 0.3 hours (mean \u00b1 S.D.). A greater than dose\u2013proportional increase in indinavir plasma \nconcentrations was observed over the 200 \u2013 800 mg dose range. Between 800\u2013mg and 1,000\u2013mg dose \nlevels, the deviation from dose\u2013proportionality is less pronounced. As a result of the short half\u2013life, \n1.8 \u00b1 0.4 hours, only a minimal increase in plasma concentrations occurred after multiple dosing. The \nbioavailability of a single 800\u2013mg dose of indinavir was approximately 65 % (90 % CI, 58 \u2013 72 %).\n\nData from a steady state study in healthy volunteers indicate that there is a diurnal variation in the \npharmacokinetics of indinavir. Following a dose regimen of 800 mg every 8 hours, measured peak \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) after morning, afternoon and evening doses were 15,550 nM, 8,720 nM \nand 8,880 nM, respectively. Corresponding plasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose were 220 nM, \n210 nM and 370 nM, respectively. The relevance of these findings for ritonavir boosted indinavir is \nunknown. At steady state following a dose regimen of 800 mg every 8 hours, HIV\u2013seropositive adult \npatients in one study achieved geometric means of: AUC0-8h of 27,813 nM*h (90 % confidence \ninterval = 22,185, 34,869), peak plasma concentrations 11,144 nM (90 % confidence interval = 9,192, \n13,512) and plasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose 211 nM (90 % confidence interval = 163, \n274).\n\n \n\n\n\n23\n\nFood effect\nAt steady state following a dose regimen of 800 mg/100 mg of indinavir/ritonavir every 12 hours with \na low-fat meal, healthy volunteers in one study achieved geometric means: AUC0-12h 116,067 nM*h \n(90 % confidence interval = 101,680, 132,490), peak plasma concentrations 19,001 nM (90 % \nconfidence interval = 17,538, 20,588), and plasma concentrations at 12 hours post dose 2,274 nM \n(90 % confidence interval = 1,701, 3,042). No significant difference in exposure was seen when the \nregimen was given with a high-fat meal. \n\nIndinavir boosted regimen. Limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir in \nassociation with low dose ritonavir. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir (400 mg) with ritonavir \n(100 mg) dosed twice daily was examined in two studies. Pharmacokinetic analysis in one study was \nperformed on nineteen of the patients, with a median (range) indinavir AUC 0-12hr, Cmax, and Cmin \nof 25,421 nM*h (21,489 \u2013 36,236 nM*h), 5,758 nM (5,056 \u2013 6,742 nM) and 239 (169 \u2013 421 nM), \nrespectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters in the second study were comparable.\n\nIn HIV\uf02dinfected paediatric patients, a dose regimen of indinavir hard capsules, 500 mg/m2 every \n8 hours, produced AUC0\u20138hr values of 27,412 nM*h, peak plasma concentrations of 12,182 nM, and \nplasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose of 122 nM. The AUC and peak plasma concentrations \nwere generally similar to those previously observed in HIV\u2013infected adults receiving the \nrecommended dose of 800 mg every 8 hours; it should be observed that the plasma concentrations \n8 hours post dose were lower.\n\nDuring pregnancy, it has been demonstrated that the systemic exposure of indinavir is relevantly \ndecreased (PACTG 358. Crixivan, 800 mg every 8 hours + zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours and \nlamivudine 150 mg twice a day). The mean indinavir plasma AUC0-8hr at week 30-32 of gestation \n(n = 11) was 9,231 nM\uf02ahr, which is 74 % (95 % CI: 50 %, 86 %) lower than that observed 6 weeks \npostpartum. Six of these 11 (55 %) patients had mean indinavir plasma concentrations 8 hours post-\ndose (Cmin) below assay threshold of reliable quantification. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir in \nthese 11 patients at 6 weeks postpartum were generally similar to those observed in non-pregnant \npatients in another study (see section 4.6). \n\nAdministration of indinavir with a meal high in calories, fat, and protein resulted in a blunted and \nreduced absorption with an approximate 80 % reduction in AUC and an 86 % reduction in Cmax. \nAdministration with light meals (e.g., dry toast with jam or fruit conserve, apple juice, and coffee with \nskimmed or fat\u2013free milk and sugar or corn flakes, skimmed or fat\u2013free milk and sugar) resulted in \nplasma concentrations comparable to the corresponding fasted values.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of indinavir taken as indinavir sulphate salt (from opened hard capsules) mixed \nin apple sauce were generally comparable to the pharmacokinetics of indinavir taken as hard capsules, \nunder fasting conditions. In HIV\u2013infected paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nindinavir in apple sauce were: AUC0\u20138hr of 26,980 nM*h; peak plasma concentration of 13,711 nM; \nand plasma concentration at 8 hours post dose of 146 nM.\n\nDistribution\nIndinavir was not highly bound to human plasma proteins (39 % unbound). \n\nThere are no data concerning the penetration of indinavir into the central nervous system in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nSeven major metabolites were identified and the metabolic pathways were identified as \nglucuronidation at the pyridine nitrogen, pyridine\u2013N\u2013oxidation with and without 3\u2019\u2013hydroxylation on \nthe indane ring, 3\u2019\u2013hydroxylation of indane, p\u2013hydroxylation of phenylmethyl moiety, and \nN-depyridomethylation with and without the 3\u2019\u2013hydroxylation. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes indicated that CYP3A4 is the only P450 isozyme that plays a major role in the oxidative \n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\nmetabolism of indinavir. Analysis of plasma and urine samples from subjects who received indinavir \nindicated that indinavir metabolites had little proteinase inhibitory activity.\n\nElimination\nOver the 200\u20131,000\u2013mg dose range administered in both volunteers and HIV infected patients, there \nwas a slightly greater than dose\u2013proportional increase in urinary recovery of indinavir. Renal \nclearance (116 mL/min) of indinavir is concentration\u2013independent over the clinical dose range. Less \nthan 20 % of indinavir is excreted renally. Mean urinary excretion of unchanged medicinal product \nfollowing single dose administration in the fasted state was 10.4 % following a 700\u2013mg dose, and \n12.0 % following a 1,000\u2013mg dose. Indinavir was rapidly eliminated with a half\u2013life of 1.8 hours.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nPharmacokinetics of indinavir do not appear to be affected by race.\n\nThere are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of indinavir in HIV \nseropositive women compared to HIV seropositive men. \n\nPatients with mild\u2013to\u2013moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence \nof decreased metabolism of indinavir resulting in approximately 60 % higher mean AUC following a\n400\u2013mg dose. The mean half\u2013life of indinavir increased to approximately 2.8 hours.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCrystals have been seen in the urine of rats, one monkey, and one dog. The crystals have not been \nassociated with medicinal product \u2013induced renal injury. An increase in thyroidal weight and \nthyroidal follicular cell hyperplasia, due to an increase in thyroxine clearance, was seen in rats treated \nwith indinavir at doses \uf0b3 160 mg/kg/day. An increase in hepatic weight occurred in rats treated with\nindinavir at doses \uf0b3 40 mg/kg/day and was accompanied by hepatocellular hypertrophy at doses \n\uf0b3 320 mg/kg/day. \n\nThe maximum non\u2013lethal oral dose of indinavir was at least 5,000 mg/kg in rats and mice, the highest \ndose tested in acute toxicity studies.\n\nStudies in rats indicated that uptake into brain tissue was limited, distribution into and out of the \nlymphatic system was rapid, and excretion into the milk of lactating rats was extensive. Distribution \nof indinavir across the placental barrier was significant in rats, but limited in rabbits.\n\nMutagenicity\nIndinavir did not have any mutagenic or genotoxic activity in studies with or without metabolic \nactivation.\n\nCarcinogenicity\nNo carcinogenicity was noted in mice at the maximum tolerated dose, which corresponded to a \nsystemic exposure approximately 2 to 3 times higher than the clinical exposure. In rats, at similar \nexposure levels, an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was seen, probably related to an increase \nin release of thyroid stimulating hormone secondary to an increase in thyroxine clearance. The \nrelevance of the findings to humans is likely limited.\n\nDevelopmental Toxicity\nDevelopmental toxicity studies were performed in rats, rabbits and dogs (at doses which produced \nsystemic exposures comparable to or slightly greater than human exposure) and revealed no evidence \nof teratogenicity. No external or visceral changes were observed in rats, however, increases in the \nincidence of supernumerary ribs and of cervical ribs were seen. No external, visceral, or skeletal \nchanges were observed in rabbits or dogs. In rats and rabbits, no effects on embryonic/foetal survival \nor foetal weights were observed. In dogs, a slight increase in resorptions was seen; however, all \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nfoetuses in medication\u2013treated animals were viable, and the incidence of live foetuses in medication\u2013\ntreated animals was comparable to that in controls.\n\n6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT\n\nCRIXIVAN 400 mg hard capsules\n\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION\n\nEach hard capsule contains indinavir sulphate corresponding to 400 mg of indinavir. \n\nExcipient with known effect\nEach 400 mg capsule contains 149.6 mg of lactose.\n\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1\n\n3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM\n\nHard capsule.\n\nThe capsules are semi\u2013translucent white and coded \u2018CRIXIVAN 400 mg\u2019 in green. \n\n4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS\n\n4.1 Therapeutic indications\n\nCRIXIVAN is indicated in combination with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues for the treatment of \nHIV\u20131 infected adults.\n\n4.2 Posology and method of administration\n\nCRIXIVAN should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV \ninfection. On the basis of current pharmacodynamic data, indinavir must be used in combination with\nother antiretroviral agents. When indinavir is administered as monotherapy resistant viruses rapidly \nemerge (see section 5.1).\n\nPosology\nThe recommended dose of indinavir is 800 mg orally every 8 hours.\n\nData from published studies suggest that CRIXIVAN 400 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg, \nboth administered orally twice daily, may be an alternative dosing regimen. The suggestion is based \non limited published data (see section 5.2).\n\nA dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when administering \nitraconazole or ketoconazole concurrently (see section 4.5).\n\nSpecial populations\nHepatic impairment\nIn patients with mild\u2013to\u2013moderate hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis, the dose of indinavir should \nbe reduced to 600 mg every 8 hours. The recommendation is based on limited pharmacokinetic data \n(see section 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied; therefore, no dosing \nrecommendations can be made (see section 4.4).\n\nRenal impairment\nSafety in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied; however, less than 20 % of \nindinavir is excreted in the urine as unchanged medicinal product or metabolites (see section 4.4).\n\n \n\n\n\n28\n\nPaediatric population \nThe safety and efficacy of CRIXIVAN in children under the age of 4 years have not been established \n(see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data in children above the age of 4 years are described \nin sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2.\n\nMethod of administration\nThe hard capsules should be swallowed whole.\n\nSince CRIXIVAN must be taken at intervals of 8 hours, a schedule convenient for the patient should \nbe developed. For optimal absorption, CRIXIVAN should be administered without food but with \nwater 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Alternatively, CRIXIVAN may be administered with a \nlow\u2013fat, light meal.\n\nIf co-administered with ritonavir, CRIXIVAN may be administered with or without food\n\nTo ensure adequate hydration, it is recommended that adults drink at least 1.5 litres of liquids during \nthe course of 24 hours.\n\n4.3 Contraindications\n\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.\n\nIndinavir with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with medicinal products \nwith narrow therapeutic windows and which are substrates of CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by \nboth CRIXIVAN and ritonavir could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these medicines, \npotentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions (see section 4.5).\n\nCRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with amiodarone, \nterfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, quetiapine, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam administered orally \n(for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), pimozide, ergot derivatives, \nsimvastatin or lovastatin (see section 4.4).\n\nCombination of rifampicin with CRIXIVAN with or without concomitant low-dose ritonavir is \ncontraindicated (see section 4.5). Concurrent use of indinavir with herbal preparations containing St \nJohn\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).\n\nIn addition, indinavir with ritonavir must not be administered with alfuzosin, meperidine, piroxicam, \npropoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, flecanide, propafenone, quinidine, fusidic acid, clozapine, \nclorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam.\n\nIndinavir must not be given with ritonavir to patients with decompensated liver disease as ritonavir is \nprincipally metabolized and eliminated by the liver (see section 4.4).\n\nWhen CRIXIVAN is used with ritonavir, consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of ritonavir \nfor additional contraindications.\n\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use\n\nNephrolithiasis and tubulointerstitial nephritis\nNephrolithiasis has occurred with indinavir therapy in adult patients with a cumulative frequency of \n12.4 % (range across individual trials: 4.7 % to 34.4 %). The cumulative frequency of nephrolithiasis \nevents increases with increasing exposure to CRIXIVAN; however, the risk over time remains \nrelatively constant. In some cases, nephrolithiasis has been associated with renal insufficiency or \nacute renal failure; in the majority of these cases renal insufficiency and acute renal failure were \nreversible. If signs and symptoms of nephrolithiasis, including flank pain with or without haematuria \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\n(including microscopic haematuria) occur, temporary interruption of therapy (e.g. for 1\u20133 days) \nduring the acute episode of nephrolithiasis or discontinuation of therapy may be considered. \nEvaluation may consist of urinalysis, serum BUN and creatinine, and ultrasound of the bladder and \nkidneys. Adequate hydration is recommended in all patients on indinavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).\n\nMedical management in patients with one or more episodes of nephrolithiasis must include adequate \nhydration and may include temporary interruption of therapy (e.g., 1 to 3 days) during the acute \nepisode of nephrolithiasis or discontinuation of therapy.\n\nCases of interstitial nephritis with medullary calcification and cortical atrophy have been observed in \npatients with asymptomatic severe leucocyturia (> 100 cells/high power field). In patients at increased \nrisk, urinary screening should be considered. If persistent severe leucocyturia is found, further \ninvestigation might be warranted.\n\nMedicinal product interactions\nIndinavir should be used cautiously with other medicinal products that are potent inducers of \nCYP3A4. Co\u2013administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of indinavir and as a \nconsequence an increased risk for suboptimal treatment and facilitation of development of resistance \n(see section 4.5).\n\nIf indinavir is given with ritonavir, the potential interaction may be increased. The Interactions section \nof the SPC for ritonavir should also be consulted for information about potential interactions.\n\nAtazanavir as well as indinavir are associated with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia due to \ninhibition of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Combinations of atazanavir with or without \nritonavir and Crixivan have not been studied and co-administration of these medicinal products is not \nrecommended due to risk of worsening of these adverse reactions.\n\nConcomitant use of indinavir with lovastatin or simvastatin is not recommended due to an increased \nrisk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Based on an interaction study with lopinavir/ritonavir, \ncombination of rosuvastatin and protease inhibitors is not recommended.  Caution must also be \nexercised if indinavir is used concurrently with atorvastatin.  The interaction of indinavir or \nindinavir/ritonavir with pravastatin or fluvastatin is not known (see section 4.5).\n\nCo\u2013administration of CRIXIVAN with sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil (PDE5 inhibitors) are \nexpected to substantially increase the plasma concentrations of these compounds and may result in an \nincrease in PDE5 inhibitor\u2013associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and \npriapism (see section 4.5).\n\nHIV Transmission\nWhile effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce \nthe risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent \ntransmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.\n\nAcute haemolytic anaemia\nAcute haemolytic anaemia has been reported which in some cases was severe and progressed rapidly. \nOnce a diagnosis is apparent, appropriate measures for the treatment of haemolytic anaemia should be \ninstituted which may include discontinuation of indinavir.\n\nWeight and metabolic parameters\nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\n\n \n\n\n\n30\n\nLiver disease\nThe safety and efficacy of indinavir has not been established in patients with significant underlying \nliver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of \nconcomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product \ninformation for these medicinal products.\n\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be \nmonitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such \npatients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.\n\nAn increased incidence of nephrolithiasis has been observed in patients with underlying liver \ndisorders when treated with indinavir.\n\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, \nsuch reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. \nRelevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, \nand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary.\n\nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n\nPatients with coexisting conditions\nThere have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and \nhaemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients additional \nfactor VIII was given. In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or \nre-introduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship has been evoked, although the \nmechanism of action has not been elucidated. Haemophiliac patients should therefore be made aware \nof the possibility of increased bleeding.\n\nPatients with mild\u2013to\u2013moderate hepatic insufficiency due to cirrhosis will require a dose reduction of \nindinavir due to decreased metabolism of indinavir (see section 4.2). Patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment have not been studied. In the absence of such studies, caution should be exercised as \nincreased levels of indinavir may occur.\n\nSafety in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied; however, less than 20 % of \nindinavir is excreted in the urine as unchanged medicinal product or metabolites (see section 4.2).\n\nOsteonecrosis:\nAlthough the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience \njoint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.\n\nLactose\nThis medicinal product contains 299.2 mg of lactose in each 800 mg dose (maximum single dose). \nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or \nglucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \n\n \n\n\n\n31\n\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\n\nThe metabolism of indinavir is mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Therefore, other \nsubstances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the \npharmacokinetics of indinavir. Similarly, indinavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other \nsubstances that share this metabolic pathway. Boosted indinavir (indinavir with ritonavir) may have \nadditive pharmacokinetic effects on substances that share the CYP3A4 pathway as both ritonavir and \nindinavir inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.\n\nIndinavir with or without ritonavir should not be administered concurrently with medicinal products \nwith narrow therapeutic windows and which are substrates of CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by \nboth CRIXIVAN and ritonavir could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these medicines, \npotentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions. CRIXIVAN with or without ritonavir should \nnot be administered concurrently with amiodarone, terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, quetiapine, \nalprazolam, triazolam, midazolam administered orally (for caution on parenterally administered \nmidazolam, see Table 1 and 2 below), pimozide, ergot derivatives, simvastatin or lovastatin. In \naddition, indinavir with ritonavir should not be administered with alfuzosin, meperidine, piroxicam, \npropoxyphene, bepridil, encainide, flecanide, propafenone, quinidine, fusidic acid, clozapine, \nclorazepate, diazepam, estazolam and flurazepam.\n\nConcurrent use of indinavir with rifampicin or herbal preparations containing St John\u2019s wort \n(Hypericum perforatum) is contraindicated.\n\nMedicinal products listed above are not repeated in Table 1 and 2 unless specific interaction data is \navailable.\n\nRefer also to sections 4.2 and 4.3.\n\nTable 1. Interactions and dose recommendations with other medical products \u2013 UNBOOSTED \nINDINAVIR\n\nInteractions between indinavir and other medicinal products are listed in the tables below (increase is \nindicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change (\u2264 +/- 20 %) as \u201c\u2194\u201d, single dose as \u201cSD\u201d, once daily as \n\u201cQD\u201d, twice daily as \u201cBID\u201d, three times daily as \u201cTID\u201d, and four times daily as \"QID\").\n\nMedicinal products by \ntherapeutic areas\n\nInteraction Recommendations \nconcerning co-\nadministration\n\nANTI-INFECTIVES\nAntiretrovirals\nNRTIs\nDidanosine \nFormulation with buffer\n\nNo formal interaction study has been \nperformed.

Indinavir should be used \nduring pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Given that \nsubstantially lower antepartum exposures have been observed in a small study of HIV-infected \npregnant patients and the limited data in this patient population, indinavir use is not recommended in \nHIV-infected pregnant patients (see section 5.2). \n\nHyperbilirubinaemia, reported predominantly as elevated indirect bilirubin, has occurred in 14 % of \npatients during treatment with indinavir. Because it is unknown whether indinavir will exacerbate \n\n \n\n\n\n42\n\nphysiologic hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates, careful consideration must be given to the use of \nindinavir in pregnant women at the time of delivery (see section 4.8).\n\nIn Rhesus monkeys, administration of indinavir to neonates caused a mild exacerbation of the \ntransient physiologic hyperbilirubinaemia seen in this species after birth. Administration of indinavir \nto pregnant Rhesus monkeys during the third trimester did not cause a similar exacerbation in \nneonates; however, only limited placental transfer of indinavir occurred.\n\nBreast-feeding\nIt is recommended that HIV\uf02dinfected women do not breast\uf02dfeed their infants under any \ncircumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV. It is not known whether indinavir is excreted in \nhuman milk. Mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast\uf02dfeeding during treatment. \n\nFertility\nThere are no data available regarding potential effects of CRIXIVAN treatment on male or female \nfertility.\n\n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines\n\nNo studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. There are no \ndata to suggest that indinavir affects the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients should \nbe informed that dizziness and blurred vision have been reported during treatment with indinavir.\n\n4.8 Undesirable effects\n\nNephrolithiasis occurred in approximately 10 % of patients treated with the recommended \n(unboosted) dose of CRIXIVAN in a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials (see also below table \nand in section 4.4). \n\nClinical adverse reactions reported by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely related to \nCRIXIVAN in \uf0b3 5 % of patients treated with CRIXIVAN monotherapy or in combination with \nNRTI(s) (n = 309) for 24 weeks are listed below. Many of these adverse reactions were also identified \nas common pre\u2013existing or frequently occurring medical conditions in this population. These adverse \nreactions were: nausea (35.3 %), headache (25.2 %), diarrhoea (24.6 %), asthenia/fatigue (24.3 %), \nrash (19.1 %), taste perversion (19.1 %), dry skin (16.2 %), abdominal pain (14.6 %), vomiting \n(11.0 %), dizziness (10.7 %). With the exception of dry skin, rash, and taste perversion, the incidence \nof clinical adverse reactions was similar or higher among patients treated with antiretroviral \nnucleoside analogue controls than among patients treated with CRIXIVAN monotherapy or in \ncombination with NRTI(s). This overall safety profile remained similar for 107 patients treated with \nCRIXIVAN monotherapy or in combination with NRTI(s) for up to 48 weeks. Adverse reactions, \nincluding nephrolithiasis, may lead to treatment interruption.\n\nIn controlled clinical trials conducted world\u2013wide, indinavir was administered alone or in \ncombination with other antiretroviral agents (zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, and/or lamivudine) to \napproximately 2,000 patients, the majority of whom were adult Caucasian males (15 % females).\n\nIndinavir did not alter the type, frequency, or severity of known major adverse reactions associated \nwith the use of zidovudine, didanosine, or lamivudine.\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies in adults and/or post-\nmarketing use for CRIXIVAN monotherapy and/or CRIXIVAN with combination antiretroviral \ntherapy (CART).\n\nVery common (\u2265 1/10); Common (\u2265 1/100 to \uf03c 1/10); Uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); \nRare (\u2265 1/10,000 to \uf03c 1/1,000); Very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the \n\n \n\n\n\n43\n\navailable data).

In some patients, \nresolution of the interstitial nephritis did not occur \nfollowing discontinuation of indinavir therapy; \nrenal insufficiency, renal failure, leucocyturia (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nGeneral disorders and \nadministration site conditions\n\nVery \ncommon\n\nasthenia/fatigue, taste perversion, abdominal pain.\n\nMetabolic parameters\nWeight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see \nsection 4.4).\n\nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic\ninfections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur \nmany months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).\n\nDescription of selected adverse reactions\nNephrolithiasis\nNephrolithiasis, including flank pain with or without haematuria (including microscopic haematuria), \nhas been reported in approximately 10 % (252/2,577) of patients receiving CRIXIVAN in clinical \ntrials at the recommended dose compared to 2.2 % in the control arms. In general, these events were \nnot associated with renal dysfunction and resolved with hydration and temporary interruption of \ntherapy (e.g., 1\u20133 days).\n\nHyperbilirubinaemia \nIsolated asymptomatic hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin \uf0b3 2.5 mg/dL, 43 mcmol/L) was reported \npredominantly as elevated indirect bilirubin and rarely associated with elevations in ALT, AST, or \nalkaline phosphatase, has occurred in approximately 14 % of patients treated with CRIXIVAN alone \nor in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Most patients continued treatment with CRIXIVAN\nwithout dose reduction and bilirubin values gradually declined toward baseline. Hyperbilirubinaemia \noccurred more frequently at doses exceeding 2.4 g/day compared to doses less than 2.4 g/day. \n\nPaediatric population\nIn clinical trials in paediatric patients (\u2265 3 years), the adverse reaction profile was similar to that for \nadult patients except for a higher frequency of nephrolithiasis of 29 % (20/70) in paediatric patients \ntreated with CRIXIVAN. Asymptomatic pyuria of unknown etiology was noted in 10.9 % (6/55) of \npaediatric patients who received CRIXIVAN. Some of these events were associated with mild \nelevation of serum creatinine.\n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V.\n\n4.9 Overdose\n\nThere have been reports of human overdose with CRIXIVAN. The most commonly reported \nsymptoms were gastro-intestinal (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and renal (e.g., nephrolithiasis, \nflank pain, haematuria).\n\nIt is not known whether indinavir is dialyzable by peritoneal or haemodialysis. \n\n5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\n\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties\n\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, protease inhibitor, ATC code JO5AE02\n\nMechanism of action\nIndinavir inhibits recombinant HIV\u20131 and HIV\u20132 protease with an approximate tenfold selectivity for \nHIV\u20131 over HIV\u20132 proteinase. Indinavir binds reversibly to the protease active site and inhibits \ncompetitively the enzyme, thereby preventing cleavage of the viral precursor polyproteins that occurs \nduring maturation of the newly formed viral particle. The resulting immature particles are non\u2013\ninfectious and are incapable of establishing new cycles of infection. Indinavir did not significantly \ninhibit the eukaryotic proteases human renin, human cathepsin D, human elastase, and human factor \nXa.\n\nMicrobiology\nIndinavir at concentrations of 50 to 100 nM mediated 95 % inhibition (IC95) of viral spread (relative \nto an untreated virus\u2013infected control) in human T\u2013lymphoid cell cultures and primary human \nmonocytes/macrophages infected with HIV\uf02d1 variants LAI, MN, RF, and a macrophage\u2013tropic \nvariant SF\u2013162, respectively. Indinavir at concentrations of 25 to 100 nM mediated 95 % inhibition of \nviral spread in cultures of mitogen\u2013activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with \ndiverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV\uf02d1, including isolates resistant to zidovudine and non\u2013\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed \nwhen human T\u2013lymphoid cells infected with the LAI variant of HIV\u20131 were incubated with indinavir \nand either zidovudine, didanosine, or NNRTIs.\n\nMedicinal product resistance\nLoss of suppression of viral RNA levels occurred in some patients; however, CD4 cell counts were \noften sustained above pre\u2013treatment levels. When loss of viral RNA suppression occurred, it was \ntypically associated with replacement of circulating susceptible virus with resistant viral variants. \nResistance was correlated with the accumulation of mutations in the viral genome that resulted in the \nexpression of amino acid substitutions in the viral protease.\n\nAt least eleven amino acid sites in the protease have been associated with indinavir resistance: L10, \nK20, L24, M46, I54, L63, I64, A71, V82, I84, and L90. The basis for their contributions to resistance, \nhowever, is complex. None of these substitutions was either necessary or sufficient for resistance. For \nexample, no single substitution or pair of substitutions was capable of engendering measurable \n(\uf0b3 four\u2013fold) resistance to indinavir, and the level of resistance was dependent on the ways in which \nmultiple substitutions were combined. In general, however, higher levels of resistance resulted from \nthe co\u2013expression of greater numbers of substitutions at the eleven identified positions. Among \npatients experiencing viral RNA rebound during indinavir monotherapy at 800 mg q8h, substitutions \nat only three of these sites were observed in the majority of patients: V82 (to A or F), M46 (to I or L), \nand L10 (to I or R). Other substitutions were observed less frequently. The observed amino acid \n\n \n\nhttp://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Template_or_form/2013/03/WC500139752.doc\n\n\n46\n\nsubstitutions appeared to accumulate sequentially and in no consistent order, probably as a result of \nongoing viral replication.\n\nIt should be noted that the decrease in suppression of viral RNA levels was seen more frequently \nwhen therapy with indinavir was initiated at doses lower than the recommended oral dose of \n2.4 g/day. Therefore, therapy with indinavir should be initiated at the recommended dose to \nincrease suppression of viral replication and therefore inhibit the emergence of resistant virus.\n\nThe concomitant use of indinavir with nucleoside analogues (to which the patient is naive) may lessen \nthe risk of the development of resistance to both indinavir and the nucleoside analogues. In one \ncomparative trial, combination therapy with nucleoside analogues (triple therapy with zidovudine plus \ndidanosine) conferred protection against the selection of virus expressing at least one resistance\u2013\nassociated amino acid substitution to both indinavir (from 13/24 to 2/20 at therapy week 24) and to \nthe nucleoside analogues (from 10/16 to 0/20 at therapy week 24).\n\nCross resistance\nHIV\uf02d1 patient isolates with reduced susceptibility to indinavir expressed varying patterns and degrees \nof cross\u2013resistance to a series of diverse HIV PIs, including ritonavir and saquinavir. Complete \ncross\uf02dresistance was noted between indinavir and ritonavir; however, cross\uf02dresistance to saquinavir \nvaried among isolates. Many of the protease amino acid substitutions reported to be associated with \nresistance to ritonavir and saquinavir were also associated with resistance to indinavir.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects \n\nAdults\nTreatment with indinavir alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents (i.e., nucleoside \nanalogues) has so far been documented to reduce viral load and increase CD4 lymphocytes in patients \nwith CD4 cell counts below 500 cells/mm3.\n\nIn one published study, 20 HIV-infected patients with undetectable plasma viral load \n(< 200 copies/mL) receiving indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours were switched in an open, cross-over \ndesign to indinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg every 12 hours. Eighteen patients completed the study to \nweek 48. Viral load remained < 200 copies/mL for 48 weeks in all patients. \n\nAnother published study evaluated the efficacy and safety of indinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg every \n12 hours in 40 antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients. Thirty subjects completed 48 weeks of treatment. At \nweek 4, the indinavir Cmin was 500 ng/mL with substantial trough variability (range 5 to \n8,100 ng/mL). By intent to treat analysis 65 % of patients had HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL and 50 % \nhad viral load < 50 copies/mL; by on-treatment analysis 96 % of patients had HIV RNA \n< 400 copies/mL and 74 % had viral load < 50 copies/mL.\n\nEighty antiretroviral na\u00efve patients were entered into a third published study. In this open label non-\nrandomized single arm study, patients were treated with stavudine and lamivudine plus \nindinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg every 12 hours. Sixty-two patients completed the study to week 96. In \nthe intent to treat and on treatment analyses the proportion of patients with HIV RNA of \n< 50 copies/mL was 68.8 % and 88.7 %, respectively, at week 96.\n\nIndinavir alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues (zidovudine/stavudine and lamivudine) \nhas been shown to delay clinical progression rate compared with nucleoside analogues and to provide \na sustained effect on viral load and CD4 count.\n\nIn zidovudine experienced patients, indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine in combination compared \nwith lamivudine added to zidovudine reduced the probability of AIDS defining illness or death \n(ADID) at 48 weeks from 13 % to 7 %. Similarly, in antiretroviral naive patients, indinavir with and \nwithout zidovudine compared with zidovudine alone reduced the probability of ADID at 48 weeks \n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\nfrom 15 % with zidovudine alone to approximately 6 % with indinavir alone or in combination with \nzidovudine.\n\nEffects on viral load were consistently more pronounced in patients treated with indinavir in \ncombination with nucleoside analogues, but the proportion of patients with serum viral RNA below \nthe limit of quantification (500 copies/mL) varied between studies, at week 24 from 40 % to more \nthan 80 %. This proportion tends to remain stable over prolonged periods of follow\u2013up. Similarly, \neffects on CD4 cell count tend to be more pronounced in patients treated with indinavir in \ncombination with nucleoside analogues compared with indinavir alone. Within studies, this effect is \nsustained also after prolonged periods of follow\u2013up.\n\nPaediatric population\nTwo clinical trials in 41 paediatric patients (4 to 15 years of age) were designed to characterise the \nsafety, antiretroviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of indinavir in combination with stavudine and \nlamivudine. In one study, at week 24, the proportion of patients with plasma viral RNA below \n400 copies/mL was 60 %; the mean increase in CD4 cell counts was 242 cells/mm3; and the mean \nincrease in percent CD4 cell counts was 4.2 %. At week 60, the proportion of patients with plasma \nviral RNA below 400 copies/mL was 59 %. In another study, at week 16, the proportion of patients\nwith plasma viral RNA below 400 copies/mL was 59 %; the mean increase in CD4 cell counts was \n73 cells/mm3; and the mean increase in percent CD4 cell counts was 1.2 %. At week 24, the \nproportion of patients with plasma viral RNA below 400 copies/mL was 60 %.\n\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties\n\nAbsorption\nIndinavir is rapidly absorbed in the fasted state with a time to peak plasma concentration of 0.8 hours \n\u00b1 0.3 hours (mean \u00b1 S.D.). A greater than dose\u2013proportional increase in indinavir plasma \nconcentrations was observed over the 200 \u2013 800 mg dose range. Between 800\u2013mg and 1,000\u2013mg dose \nlevels, the deviation from dose\u2013proportionality is less pronounced. As a result of the short half\u2013life, \n1.8 \u00b1 0.4 hours, only a minimal increase in plasma concentrations occurred after multiple dosing. The \nbioavailability of a single 800\u2013mg dose of indinavir was approximately 65 % (90 % CI, 58 \u2013 72 %).\n\nData from a steady state study in healthy volunteers indicate that there is a diurnal variation in the \npharmacokinetics of indinavir. Following a dose regimen of 800 mg every 8 hours, measured peak \nplasma concentrations (Cmax) after morning, afternoon and evening doses were 15,550 nM, 8,720 nM \nand 8,880 nM, respectively. Corresponding plasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose were 220 nM, \n210 nM and 370 nM, respectively. The relevance of these findings for ritonavir boosted indinavir is \nunknown. At steady state following a dose regimen of 800 mg every 8 hours, HIV\u2013seropositive adult \npatients in one study achieved geometric means of: AUC0-8h of 27,813 nM*h (90 % confidence \ninterval = 22,185, 34,869), peak plasma concentrations 11,144 nM (90 % confidence interval = 9,192, \n13,512) and plasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose 211 nM (90 % confidence interval = \n163,274).\n\nFood effect\nAt steady state following a dose regimen of 800 mg/100 mg of indinavir/ritonavir every 12 hours with \na low-fat meal, healthy volunteers in one study achieved geometric means: AUC0-12h 116,067 nM*h \n(90 % confidence interval = 101,680, 132,490), peak plasma concentrations 19,001 nM (90 % \nconfidence interval = 17,538, 20,588), and plasma concentrations at 12 hours post dose 2,274 nM \n(90 % confidence interval = 1,701, 3,042). No significant difference in exposure was seen when the \nregimen was given with a high-fat meal.\n\nIndinavir boosted regimen. Limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir in \nassociation with low dose ritonavir. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir (400 mg) with ritonavir \n(100 mg) dosed twice daily was examined in two studies. Pharmacokinetic analysis in one study was \nperformed on nineteen of the patients, with a median (range) indinavir AUC 0-12hr, Cmax, and Cmin \n\n \n\n\n\n48\n\nof 25,421 nM*h (21,489 \u2013 36,236 nM*h), 5,758 nM (5,056 \u2013 6,742 nM) and 239 (169 \u2013 421 nM), \nrespectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters in the second study were comparable.\n\nIn HIV\uf02dinfected paediatric patients, a dose regimen of indinavir hard capsules, 500 mg/m2 every \n8 hours, produced AUC0\u20138hr values of 27,412 nM*h, peak plasma concentrations of 12,182 nM, and \nplasma concentrations at 8 hours post dose of 122 nM. The AUC and peak plasma concentrations \nwere generally similar to those previously observed in HIV\u2013infected adults receiving the \nrecommended dose of 800 mg every 8 hours; it should be observed that the plasma concentrations \n8 hours post dose were lower.\n\nDuring pregnancy, it has been demonstrated that the systemic exposure of indinavir is relevantly \ndecreased (PACTG 358. Crixivan, 800 mg every 8 hours + zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours and \nlamivudine 150 mg twice a day). The mean indinavir plasma AUC0-8hr at week 30-32 of gestation \n(n = 11) was 9,231 nM\uf02ahr, which is 74 % (95 % CI: 50 %, 86 %) lower than that observed 6 weeks \npostpartum. Six of these 11 (55 %) patients had mean indinavir plasma concentrations 8 hours post-\ndose (Cmin) below assay threshold of reliable quantification. The pharmacokinetics of indinavir in \nthese 11 patients at 6 weeks postpartum were generally similar to those observed in non-pregnant \npatients in another study (see section 4.6).\n\nAdministration of indinavir with a meal high in calories, fat, and protein resulted in a blunted and \nreduced absorption with an approximate 80 % reduction in AUC and an 86 % reduction in Cmax. \nAdministration with light meals (e.g., dry toast with jam or fruit conserve, apple juice, and coffee with \nskimmed or fat\u2013free milk and sugar or corn flakes, skimmed or fat\u2013free milk and sugar) resulted in \nplasma concentrations comparable to the corresponding fasted values.\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of indinavir taken as indinavir sulphate salt (from opened hard capsules) mixed \nin apple sauce were generally comparable to the pharmacokinetics of indinavir taken as hard capsules, \nunder fasting conditions. In HIV\u2013infected paediatric patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nindinavir in apple sauce were: AUC0\u20138hr of 26,980 nM*h; peak plasma concentration of 13,711 nM; \nand plasma concentration at 8 hours post dose of 146 nM.\n\nDistribution\nIndinavir was not highly bound to human plasma proteins (39 % unbound). \n\nThere are no data concerning the penetration of indinavir into the central nervous system in humans.\n\nBiotransformation\nSeven major metabolites were identified and the metabolic pathways were identified as \nglucuronidation at the pyridine nitrogen, pyridine\u2013N\u2013oxidation with and without 3\u2019\u2013hydroxylation on \nthe indane ring, 3\u2019\u2013hydroxylation of indane, p\u2013hydroxylation of phenylmethyl moiety, and \nN-depyridomethylation with and without the 3\u2019\u2013hydroxylation. In vitro studies with human liver \nmicrosomes indicated that CYP3A4 is the only P450 isozyme that plays a major role in the oxidative \nmetabolism of indinavir. Analysis of plasma and urine samples from subjects who received indinavir \nindicated that indinavir metabolites had little proteinase inhibitory activity.\n\nElimination\nOver the 200\u20131,000\u2013mg dose range administered in both volunteers and HIV infected patients, there \nwas a slightly greater than dose\u2013proportional increase in urinary recovery of indinavir. Renal \nclearance (116 mL/min) of indinavir is concentration\u2013independent over the clinical dose range. Less \nthan 20 % of indinavir is excreted renally. Mean urinary excretion of unchanged medicinal product \nfollowing single dose administration in the fasted state was 10.4 % following a 700\u2013mg dose, and \n12.0 % following a 1,000\u2013mg dose. Indinavir was rapidly eliminated with a half\u2013life of 1.8 hours.\n\nCharacteristics in patients\nPharmacokinetics of indinavir do not appear to be affected by race.\n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\nThere are no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of indinavir in HIV \nseropositive women compared to HIV seropositive men. \n\nPatients with mild\u2013to\u2013moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence \nof decreased metabolism of indinavir resulting in approximately 60 % higher mean AUC following a \n400\u2013mg dose. The mean half\u2013life of indinavir increased to approximately 2.8 hours.\n\n5.3 Preclinical safety data\n\nCrystals have been seen in the urine of rats, one monkey, and one dog. The crystals have not been \nassociated with medicinal product \u2013induced renal injury. An increase in thyroidal weight and \nthyroidal follicular cell hyperplasia, due to an increase in thyroxine clearance, was seen in rats treated \nwith indinavir at doses \uf0b3 160 mg/kg/day. An increase in hepatic weight occurred in rats treated with \nindinavir at doses \uf0b3 40 mg/kg/day and was accompanied by hepatocellular hypertrophy at doses \n\uf0b3 320 mg/kg/day. \n\nThe maximum non\u2013lethal oral dose of indinavir was at least 5,000 mg/kg in rats and mice, the highest \ndose tested in acute toxicity studies.\n\nStudies in rats indicated that uptake into brain tissue was limited, distribution into and out of the \nlymphatic system was rapid, and excretion into the milk of lactating rats was extensive. Distribution \nof indinavir across the placental barrier was significant in rats, but limited in rabbits.\n\nMutagenicity\nIndinavir did not have any mutagenic or genotoxic activity in studies with or without metabolic \nactivation.\n\nCarcinogenicity\nNo carcinogenicity was noted in mice at the maximum tolerated dose, which corresponded to a \nsystemic exposure approximately 2 to 3 times higher than the clinical exposure. In rats, at similar \nexposure levels, an increased incidence of thyroid adenomas was seen, probably related to an increase \nin release of thyroid stimulating hormone secondary to an increase in thyroxine clearance. The \nrelevance of the findings to humans is likely limited.\n\nDevelopmental Toxicity\nDevelopmental toxicity studies were performed in rats, rabbits and dogs (at doses which produced \nsystemic exposures comparable to or slightly greater than human exposure) and revealed no evidence \nof teratogenicity. No external or visceral changes were observed in rats, however, increases in the \nincidence of supernumerary ribs and of cervical ribs were seen. No external, visceral, or skeletal \nchanges were observed in rabbits or dogs. In rats and rabbits, no effects on embryonic/foetal survival \nor foetal weights were observed. In dogs, a slight increase in resorptions was seen; however, all \nfoetuses in medication-treated animals were viable, and the incidence of live foetuses in \nmedication-treated animals was comparable to that in controls.\n\n6.

What CRIXIVAN is and what it is used for\n\nWhat CRIXIVAN is\nCRIXIVAN contains a substance called indinavir. It belongs to a group of medicines called \u2018protease \ninhibitors\u2019. \n\nWhat CRIXIVAN is used for\nCRIXIVAN is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in adults. CRIXIVAN is used at \nthe same time as other HIV treatments (antiretroviral medicines). This is called combination \nantiretroviral therapy. \n\n\uf0b7 An example of another medicine that might be given to you, at the same time as CRIXIVAN, \nis ritonavir. \n\nHow CRIXIVAN works\nCRIXIVAN treats HIV and helps to lower the number of HIV particles in your blood.\n\nCRIXIVAN helps to:\n\uf0b7 lower the risk that you get illnesses related to HIV \n\uf0b7 lower the amount of HIV in your body (your \u2018viral load\u2019)\n\uf0b7 raise your CD4 (T) cell count. CD4 cells are an important part of your immune system. The \n\nmain role of the immune system is to protect you from infections. \nCRIXIVAN may not do these things in all patients. Your doctor will monitor how this medicine \nworks for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take CRIXIVAN\n\nDo not take CRIXIVAN:\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to indinavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nSection 6). \n\uf0b7 if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\n- rifampicin - an antibiotic used to treat infections\n- cisapride - used for gut problems\n- amiodarone - used for heart rhythm problems\n- pimozide - used for some mental health problems\n- lovastatin or simvastatin - used to lower cholesterol\n- St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) - a herbal medicine used for depression\n- ergot tartramine (with or without caffeine) - used for migraines\n- astemizole or terfenadine - antihistamines used for hay fever and other allergies\n- quetiapine \u2013 used for some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar \n\ndisorder and major depressive disorder\n- alprazolam, triazolam and midazolam (by mouth) - used to make you calmer or \n\nhelp you sleep.\n\nDo not take CRIXIVAN if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nIn addition, when CRIXIVAN is given at the same time as the medicine ritonavir:\nDo not take either CRIXIVAN or ritonavir:\n\n\uf0b7 if you have liver problems \n\uf0b7 if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\n- fusidic acid - an antibiotic used to treat infections\n- piroxicam - used for arthritis\n- alfuzosin - used for prostate problems\n- bepridil - used for chest pain (angina)\n- clozapine - used for some mental health problems \n- pethidine or propoxyphene - used for pain\n- estazolam or flurazepam - used to help you sleep\n- clorazepate or diazepam - used to make you calmer\n- encainide, flecanide, propafenone, or quinidine - used for uneven heartbeat \n\nproblems.\n\nDo not take either CRIXIVAN or ritonavir if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk \nto your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN if you have had or develop any of \nthe following:\n\n\uf0b7 allergies\n\n\uf0b7 kidney problems (including inflammation of the kidneys, kidney stones, or back pain with or \nwithout blood in your urine)\n\n\uf0b7 \u2018haemophilia\u2019 \u2013 CRIXIVAN may make you more likely to bleed. If you notice bleeding or if you \nfeel weak, talk to your doctor straight away.\n\n\uf0b7 liver problems \u2013 people with \u2018chronic hepatitis B or C\u2019 or \u2018cirrhosis\u2019 who are treated with \n\u2018antiretroviral\u2019 medicines are more likely to have serious and potentially fatal liver side effects \nwith this medicine. You may need to have blood tests to check how your liver is working.\n\n\uf0b7 severe pain, tenderness or weakness in your muscles \u2013 this is more likely to happen if you are \ntaking cholesterol-lowering medicines called \u2018statins\u2019 (such as simvastatin). On rare occasions the \nmuscle problems can be serious (rhabdomyolysis). Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you \ndevelop severe muscle pain or weakness.\n\n \n\n\n\n66\n\n\uf0b7 signs of infection \u2013 this may be a previous infection which comes back soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started. This may be because the body is able to start fighting infections again. This \nhappens in some people with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and who have had HIV related \ninfections before. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor \nimmediately.\n\n\uf0b7 autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body \ntissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any \nsymptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 bone problems \u2013 signs include stiff joints, aches and pains, especially the hip and difficulty \nmoving. If you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor. Such problems might be due to a \nbone disease called \u2018osteonecrosis\u2019 (loss of blood supply to the bone causing bone death), which \ncan occur months to years after starting HIV therapy. The risk of you having bone problems is \nhigher if you:\n- drink alcohol\n- have a high body mass index\n- have an immune system that is very weak\n- have been taking corticosteroids at the same time as CRIXIVAN\n- take combination antiretroviral therapy for a long time.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking CRIXIVAN.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nCRIXIVAN is not recommended in children under the age of 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and CRIXIVAN\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines.\n\nCRIXIVAN can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the \nway CRIXIVAN works.\n\nRitonavir\nRitonavir is used for increasing the blood levels of CRIXIVAN or, less frequently and then at higher \ndoses, for HIV treatment. Talk to your doctor if you are going to take both CRIXIVAN and ritonavir. \nAlso look at the Package Leaflet for ritonavir.\n\nPlease see \u2018Do not take CRIXIVAN\u2019 and \u2018Do not take either CRIXIVAN or ritonavir\u2019 above \nunder Section 2 for an important list of medicines that you must not combine with CRIXIVAN. Do \nnot take CRIXIVAN if you are taking or have recently taken any of these medicines. If you are not \nsure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nIn addition, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN if you are \ntaking any of the following medicines since your doctor may want to adjust the dose of your \nmedicines:\n\n\uf0b7 theophylline - used for asthma\n\uf0b7 warfarin - used to thin the blood\n\uf0b7 morphine, fentanyl - used for pain\n\uf0b7 buspirone - used to make you calmer\n\uf0b7 fluconazole - used for fungal infections\n\n \n\n\n\n67\n\n\uf0b7 venlafaxine, trazodone - used for depression\n\uf0b7 tacrolimus, ciclosporin - used mainly after organ transplantation\n\uf0b7 delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine - used for HIV\n\uf0b7 amprenavir, saquinavir, atazanavir - used for HIV\n\uf0b7 sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil - used for impotence\n\uf0b7 dexamethasone - used to stop swelling (inflammation)\n\uf0b7 itraconazole, ketoconazole - used to treat fungal infections\n\uf0b7 atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin - used to lower cholesterol\n\uf0b7 fexofenadine, loratidine - antihistamines used for hay fever and other allergic conditions\n\uf0b7 oral contraceptive medicines (\u2018The Pill\u2019) containing norethindrone or ethinyl estradiol\n\uf0b7 phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine - medicines used to treat \n\nfits (epilepsy)\n\uf0b7 midazolam (by injection) - used for acute fits (seizures) and to send patients to sleep before \n\nsome medical procedures\n\uf0b7 amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, digoxin, diltiazem - used for high blood \n\npressure and some heart problems.\n\uf0b7 quetiapine \u2013 used for some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major \n\ndepressive disorder\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking CRIXIVAN.\n\nCRIXIVAN with food and drink\nSee Section 3 below for information on how to take CRIXIVAN. It is however especially important \nthat you:\n\n\uf0b7 do not take CRIXIVAN with food that is high in calories, fat and protein. This is because these \nfoods stop your body being able to take in as much CRIXIVAN and it will not work as well.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, only take \n\nCRIXIVAN if your doctor decides it is clearly necessary. It is not known whether CRIXIVAN \nis harmful to an unborn baby when taken by a pregnant woman.\n\n\uf0b7 It is recommended that women with HIV do not breast-feed. This is to stop HIV being passed \non to their baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDizziness and blurred vision have been reported during treatment with CRIXIVAN. If this happens, \ndo not drive or operate machines.\n\nOther things you should know\nCRIXIVAN is not a cure for HIV. You may still get infections or other illnesses related to HIV. So \nyou still need to keep seeing your doctor while you are taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nHIV is spread by blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still pass on HIV when \ntaking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with \nyour physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nCRIXIVAN contains lactose\nThis medicine contains lactose (type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you cannot \ntolerate or digest some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n68\n\n3. How to take CRIXIVAN\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\n\nThe recommended dose of CRIXIVAN is:\n\uf0b7 Four 200 mg capsules (800 mg) - taken three times a day (every 8 hours).\n\nThis means you will take a total of twelve 200 mg capsules (2400 mg) each day.\n\nYou usually take less CRIXIVAN if you are also taking ritonavir. The recommended doses are:\n\uf0b7 CRIXIVAN - two 200 mg capsules (400 mg) - taken twice a day.\n\nThis means you will take a total of four 200 mg capsules (800 mg) each day.\n\uf0b7 ritonavir - 100 mg - taken twice a day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n\uf0b7 Take this medicine by mouth.\n\uf0b7 Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water, skimmed or low fat milk, juice, tea or \n\ncoffee.\n\uf0b7 Do not crush or chew the capsules.\n\uf0b7 It is important for adults to drink at least 1.5 litres of liquid each day while taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nThis will help lower the risk of you getting kidney stones.\n\uf0b7 Do not take CRIXIVAN with food that is high in calories, fat and protein. This is because these \n\nstop your body being able to take in as much CRIXIVAN and it will not work as well.\n\nWhen to take\n\uf0b7 Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.\n\uf0b7 If you cannot take it without food then take CRIXIVAN with a low-fat light meal. This could \n\nbe dry toast with jam or cornflakes with skimmed or low-fat milk and sugar.\n\uf0b7 If you are also taking ritonavir, then you can take CRIXIVAN at any time of the day with or \n\nwithout food.\n\nIf you take more CRIXIVAN than you should\nIf you take more CRIXIVAN than you should, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. The following \neffects may happen:\n\uf0b7 nausea\n\uf0b7 vomiting\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 back pain\n\uf0b7 blood in your urine.\n\nIf you forget to take CRIXIVAN\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you have missed a dose, do not take it \nlater in the day. Simply continue to follow your usual schedule. \n\nIf you stop taking CRIXIVAN\nIt is important that you take CRIXIVAN exactly as your doctor tells you to - he or she will tell you \nhow long you should take your medicine. \n\uf0b7 Do not stop taking CRIXIVAN without talking to your doctor.\n\uf0b7 This is because reducing or missing doses will make it more likely that HIV will become\n\nresistant to CRIXIVAN.\n\uf0b7 If this happens, your treatment will stop working.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n\n \n\n\n\n69\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.

This is called combination\nantiretroviral therapy. \n\n\uf0b7 An example of another medicine that might be given to you, at the same time as CRIXIVAN, \nis ritonavir. \n\nHow CRIXIVAN works\nCRIXIVAN treats HIV and helps to lower the number of HIV particles in your blood.\n\nCRIXIVAN helps to:\n\uf0b7 lower the risk that you get illnesses related to HIV \n\uf0b7 lower the amount of HIV in your body (your \u2018viral load\u2019)\n\uf0b7 raise your CD4 (T) cell count. CD4 cells are an important part of your immune system. The \n\nmain role of the immune system is to protect you from infections. \nCRIXIVAN may not do these things in all patients. Your doctor will monitor how this medicine \nworks for you.\n\n2. What you need to know before you take CRIXIVAN\n\nDo not take CRIXIVAN:\n\uf0b7 if you are allergic to indinavir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in \n\nSection 6). \n\uf0b7 if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\n \n\n\n\n74\n\n- rifampicin - an antibiotic used to treat infections\n- cisapride - used for gut problems\n- amiodarone - used for heart rhythm problems\n- pimozide - used for some mental health problems\n- lovastatin or simvastatin - used to lower cholesterol\n- St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) - a herbal medicine used for depression\n- ergot tartramine (with or without caffeine) - used for migraines\n- astemizole or terfenadine - antihistamines used for hay fever and other allergies\n- quetiapine \u2013 used for some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar \n\ndisorder and major depressive disorder\n- alprazolam, triazolam and midazolam (by mouth) - used to make you calmer or \n\nhelp you sleep.\n\nDo not take CRIXIVAN if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, \npharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nIn addition, when CRIXIVAN is given at the same time as the medicine ritonavir:\nDo not take either CRIXIVAN or ritonavir:\n\n\uf0b7 if you have liver problems \n\uf0b7 if you are taking any of the following medicines:\n\n- fusidic acid - an antibiotic used to treat infections\n- piroxicam - used for arthritis\n- alfuzosin - used for prostate problems\n- bepridil - used for chest pain (angina)\n- clozapine - used for some mental health problems \n- pethidine or propoxyphene - used for pain\n- estazolam or flurazepam - used to help you sleep\n- clorazepate or diazepam - used to make you calmer\n- encainide, flecanide, propafenone, or quinidine - used for uneven heartbeat \n\nproblems.\n\nDo not take either CRIXIVAN or ritonavir if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk \nto your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nWarnings and precautions\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN if you have had or develop any of \nthe following:\n\n\uf0b7 allergies\n\n\uf0b7 kidney problems (including inflammation of the kidneys, kidney stones, or back pain with or \nwithout blood in your urine)\n\n\uf0b7 \u2018haemophilia\u2019 \u2013 CRIXIVAN may make you more likely to bleed. If you notice bleeding or if you \nfeel weak, talk to your doctor straight away.\n\n\uf0b7 liver problems \u2013 people with \u2018chronic hepatitis B or C\u2019 or \u2018cirrhosis\u2019 who are treated with \n\u2018antiretroviral\u2019 medicines are more likely to have serious and potentially fatal liver side effects \nwith this medicine. You may need to have blood tests to check how your liver is working.\n\n\uf0b7 severe pain, tenderness or weakness in your muscles \u2013 this is more likely to happen if you are \ntaking cholesterol-lowering medicines called \u2018statins\u2019 (such as simvastatin). On rare occasions the \nmuscle problems can be serious (rhabdomyolysis). Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you \ndevelop severe muscle pain or weakness.\n\n \n\n\n\n75\n\n\uf0b7 signs of infection \u2013 this may be a previous infection which comes back soon after anti-HIV \ntreatment is started. This may be because the body is able to start fighting infections again. This \nhappens in some people with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and who have had HIV related \ninfections before. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor \nimmediately.\n\n\uf0b7 autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body \ntissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. \nAutoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any \nsymptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the \nhands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, \nplease inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 bone problems \u2013 signs include stiff joints, aches and pains, especially of the hip and difficulty \nmoving. If you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor. Such problems might be due to a \nbone disease called \u2018osteonecrosis\u2019 (loss of blood supply to the bone causing bone death), which \ncan occur months to years after starting HIV therapy. The risk of you having bone problems is \nhigher if you:\n- drink alcohol\n- have a high body mass index\n- have an immune system that is very weak\n- have been taking corticosteroids at the same time as CRIXIVAN\n- take combination antiretroviral therapy for a long time.\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking CRIXIVAN.\n\nChildren and adolescents\nCRIXIVAN is not recommended in children under the age of 18 years.\n\nOther medicines and CRIXIVAN\nTell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other \nmedicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines.\n\nCRIXIVAN can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines can affect the \nway CRIXIVAN works.\n\nRitonavir\nRitonavir is used for increasing the blood levels of CRIXIVAN or, less frequently and then at higher \ndoses, for HIV treatment. Talk to your doctor if you are going to take both CRIXIVAN and ritonavir. \nAlso look at the Package Leaflet for ritonavir.\n\nPlease see \u2018Do not take CRIXIVAN\u2019 and \u2018Do not take either CRIXIVAN or ritonavir\u2019 above \nunder Section 2 for an important list of medicines that you must not combine with CRIXIVAN. Do \nnot take CRIXIVAN if you are taking or have recently taken any of these medicines. If you are not \nsure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nIn addition, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking CRIXIVAN if you are \ntaking any of the following medicines since your doctor may want to adjust the dose of your \nmedicines:\n\n\uf0b7 theophylline - used for asthma\n\uf0b7 warfarin - used to thin the blood\n\uf0b7 morphine, fentanyl - used for pain\n\uf0b7 buspirone - used to make you calmer\n\uf0b7 fluconazole - used for fungal infections\n\n \n\n\n\n76\n\n\uf0b7 venlafaxine, trazodone - used for depression\n\uf0b7 tacrolimus, ciclosporin - used mainly after organ transplantation\n\uf0b7 delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine - used for HIV\n\uf0b7 amprenavir, saquinavir, atazanavir - used for HIV\n\uf0b7 sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil - used for impotence\n\uf0b7 dexamethasone - used to stop swelling (inflammation)\n\uf0b7 itraconazole, ketoconazole - used to treat fungal infections\n\uf0b7 atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin - used to lower cholesterol\n\uf0b7 fexofenadine, loratidine - antihistamines used for hay fever and other allergic conditions\n\uf0b7 oral contraceptive medicines (\u2018The Pill\u2019) containing norethindrone or ethinyl estradiol\n\uf0b7 phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine - medicines used to treat \n\nfits (epilepsy)\n\uf0b7 midazolam (by injection) - used for acute fits (seizures) and to send patients to sleep before \n\nsome medical procedures\n\uf0b7 amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, digoxin, diltiazem - used for high blood \n\npressure and some heart problems.\n\uf0b7 quetiapine \u2013 used for some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major \n\ndepressive disorder\n\nIf any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before \ntaking CRIXIVAN.\n\nCRIXIVAN with food and drink\nSee Section 3 below for information on how to take CRIXIVAN. It is however especially important \nthat you:\n\n\uf0b7 do not take CRIXIVAN with food that is high in calories, fat and protein. This is because these \nfoods stop your body being able to take in as much CRIXIVAN and it will not work as well.\n\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n\uf0b7 If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, only take \n\nCRIXIVAN if your doctor decides it is clearly necessary. It is not known whether CRIXIVAN \nis harmful to an unborn baby when taken by a pregnant woman.\n\n\uf0b7 It is recommended that women with HIV do not breast-feed. This is to stop HIV being passed \non to their baby.\n\nDriving and using machines\nDizziness and blurred vision have been reported during treatment with CRIXIVAN. If this happens, \ndo not drive or operate machines.\n\nOther things you should know\nCRIXIVAN is not a cure for HIV. You may still get infections or other illnesses related to HIV. So \nyou still need to keep seeing your doctor while you are taking CRIXIVAN.\n\nHIV is spread by blood or sexual contact with a person with HIV. You can still pass on HIV when \ntaking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with \nyour physician the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people.\n\nCRIXIVAN contains lactose\nThis medicine contains lactose (type of sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you cannot \ntolerate or digest some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.\n\n \n\n\n\n77\n\n3. How to take CRIXIVAN\n\nAlways take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Check with your \ndoctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.\n\nHow much to take\n\nThe recommended dose of CRIXIVAN is:\n\uf0b7 Two 400 mg capsules (800 mg) - taken three times a day (every 8 hours).\n\nThis means you will take a total of six 400 mg capsules (2400 mg) each day.\n\nYou usually take less CRIXIVAN if you are also taking ritonavir. The recommended doses are:\n\uf0b7 CRIXIVAN \u2013 one 400 mg capsules (400 mg) - taken twice a day.\n\nThis means you will take a total of two 400 mg capsules (800 mg) each day.\n\uf0b7 ritonavir - 100 mg - taken twice a day.\n\nTaking this medicine\n\uf0b7 Take this medicine by mouth.\n\uf0b7 Swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water, skimmed or low fat milk, juice, tea or \n\ncoffee.\n\uf0b7 Do not crush or chew the capsules.\n\uf0b7 It is important for adults to drink at least 1.5 litres of liquid each day while taking CRIXIVAN. \n\nThis will help lower the risk of you getting kidney stones.\n\uf0b7 Do not take CRIXIVAN with food that is high in calories, fat and protein. This is because these \n\nstop your body being able to take in as much CRIXIVAN and it will not work as well.\n\nWhen to take\n\uf0b7 Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.\n\uf0b7 If you cannot take it without food then take CRIXIVAN with a low-fat light meal. This could \n\nbe dry toast with jam or cornflakes with skimmed or low-fat milk and sugar.\n\uf0b7 If you are also taking ritonavir, then you can take CRIXIVAN at any time of the day with or \n\nwithout food.\n\nIf you take more CRIXIVAN than you should\nIf you take more CRIXIVAN than you should, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. The following \neffects may happen:\n\uf0b7 nausea\n\uf0b7 vomiting\n\uf0b7 diarrhoea\n\uf0b7 back pain\n\uf0b7 blood in your urine.\n\nIf you forget to take CRIXIVAN\nDo not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you have missed a dose, do not take it \nlater in the day. Simply continue to follow your usual schedule. \n\nIf you stop taking CRIXIVAN\nIt is important that you take CRIXIVAN exactly as your doctor tells you to - he or she will tell you \nhow long you should take your medicine. \n\uf0b7 Do not stop taking CRIXIVAN without talking to your doctor. \n\uf0b7 This is because reducing or missing doses will make it more likely that HIV will become \n\nresistant to CRIXIVAN. \n\uf0b7 If this happens, your treatment will stop working.\n\nIf you have any further questions on the use of thismedicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.\n\n \n\n\n\n78\n\n4. Possible side effects\n\nDuring HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.

or simvastatin - used to lower cholesterol - st. john's wort (hypericum perforatum) - a herbal medicine used for depression - ergot tartramine (with or without caffeine) - used for migraines - astemizole or terfenadine - antihistamines used for hay fever and other allergies - quetiapine used for some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder - alprazolam, triazolam and midazolam (by mouth) - used to make you calmer or help you sleep. do not take crixivan if any of the above applies to you. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking crixivan. in addition, when crixivan is given at the same time as the medicine ritonavir: do not take either crixivan or ritonavir: if you have liver problems if you are taking any of the following medicines: - fusidic acid - an antibiotic used to treat infections - piroxicam - used for arthritis - alfuzosin - used for prostate problems - bepridil - used for chest

following: allergies kidney problems (including inflammation of the kidneys, kidney stones, or back pain with or without blood in your urine) 'haemophilia' crixivan may make you more likely to bleed. if you notice bleeding or if you feel weak, talk to your doctor straight away. liver problems people with 'chronic hepatitis b or c' or 'cirrhosis' who are treated with 'antiretroviral' medicines are more likely to have serious and potentially fatal liver side effects with this medicine. you may need to have blood tests to check how your liver is working. severe pain, tenderness or weakness in

before. if you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your hiv infection. autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. if you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. bone problems signs include stiff joints, aches and pains, especially the hip and difficulty moving. if you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor. such problems might be due to a bone disease called 'osteonecrosis' (loss of blood supply to the bone causing bone death), which can occur months to years after starting hiv therapy. the risk of you having bone problems is higher if you: - drink alcohol - have a high body mass index - have an immune system that is very weak - have been taking corticosteroids at the same time as crixivan - take combination antiretroviral therapy for a long time. if any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking crixivan. children and adolescents crixivan is

ritonavir. also look at the package leaflet for ritonavir. please see 'do not take crixivan' and 'do not take either crixivan or ritonavir' above under section 2 for an important list of medicines that you must not combine with crixivan. do not take crixivan if you are taking or have recently taken any of these medicines. if you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before

recommended dose of crixivan is: four 200 mg capsules (800 mg) - taken three times a day (every 8 hours). this means you will take a total of twelve 200 mg capsules (2400 mg) each day. you usually take less crixivan if you are also taking ritonavir. the recommended doses are: crixivan - two 200 mg capsules (400 mg) - taken twice a day. this means you will take a total of four 200 mg capsules (800 mg) each day. ritonavir - 100 mg - taken twice a day. taking this medicine take this medicine by mouth. swallow the capsules whole with a drink of water, skimmed or low fat milk, juice, tea or coffee. do not crush or chew the capsules. it is important for adults to drink at least 1.5 litres of liquid each day while taking crixivan. this will help lower the risk of you getting kidney stones. do not take crixivan with food that is high in calories, fat and protein. this is because these stop your body being able to take in as much crixivan and it will not work as well. when to take take 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. if you cannot take it without food then take crixivan with a low-fat light meal. this could be dry toast with jam or cornflakes with skimmed or low-fat milk and sugar. if you are also taking ritonavir, then you can take crixivan at any time of the day with or without food. if you take more crixivan than you should if you take more crixivan than you should, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. the following effects may happen: nausea vomiting diarrhoea back pain blood in your urine. if you forget to take crixivan do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. if you have missed a dose, do not take it later in the day. simply continue to follow your usual schedule. if you stop taking crixivan it is important that you take crixivan exactly as your doctor tells you to - he or she will tell you how long you should take your medicine. do not stop taking crixivan without talking to your doctor. this is because reducing or missing doses will make it more likely that hiv will become resistant to crixivan. if this happens, your treatment will stop working. if you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.", "Entity_Recognition": [{"Text": "crixivan", "Type": "PRODUCT_NAME", "BeginOffset": 0, "EndOffset": 0}, {"Id": 2, "BeginOffset": 190, "EndOffset": 198, "Score":
